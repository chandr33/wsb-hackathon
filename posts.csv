I had to build this time machine and it wasn't cheap so I have to cover my costs, I'm sorry.

I will take some of the proceeds and and donate it to the WallStreetBets Museum of Autism on 5th Avenue in Manhattan that opened last week; the original piss-drinking martini glass was amazing to see in person as was DFV's headband.

It's a bit lonely on earth now that the population has dropped by 9.4m but I will hopefully catch you on the next $TSLA moon flight next week. Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?

Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10-K filings for specific phrases. Let's see just how common this language is, shall we? First, the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety:

&#x200B;

>**The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.**  
>  
>Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  
>  
>  
>  
>**A ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.**  
>  
>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚ÄùA large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.  
>  
>  
>  
>**Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.**  
>  
>Our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. Other than restrictions on trading that arise under securities laws \[(or pursuant to our securities trading policy that is intended to facilitate compliance with securities laws)\], including the prohibition on trading in securities by or on behalf of a person who is aware of nonpublic material information, we have no

This post is gonna be long and in order to understand it, you need to understand how market makers works. If you don‚Äôt understand that concept, that‚Äôs fine. A simple google search will yield sources better than me, that can provide you a basic understanding of market makers and short selling. So try doing a quick search to educate yourself then come back here

# The GME-market wide Correlation

So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December, it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market.

Hence, when the market has major red days across multiple sectors, GME is still green among a sea of red. 

And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up. Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation.

When you align charts of GME since December, with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq, it‚Äôs like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest

# So why is this happening?

Well the simplified explanation is this. When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions (like Melvin capital for example), it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called.

So for example, when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position. This is pretty basic stuff

# But this isn‚Äôt a normal Short Squeeze

The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets, was the fact that GME‚Äôs short percentage reached a height of **140%**

But what does a 140% float mean?

Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed?

Well yes, that‚Äôs called naked shorting but it‚Äôs more complicated than that.

# How Naked Shorts work

When a naked short is created, it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower. So when you see 140% short percentage that doesn‚Äôt mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting, it means when these institutions (Melvin) heavily shorted GME, the Market Makers (Citadel) **created** shares out of thin air, and **tethered** them to the real shares that were borrowed. These made up shares are synthetic shares, they don‚Äôt actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares.

This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher. I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing, sorry I don‚Äôt have a time stamp but today‚Äôs hearing is worth watching if you have the time.

# The Big Short

So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to ‚ÄúSynthetic CDO‚Äôs‚Äù from the 2008 crisis. I‚Äôm using synthetic CDO‚Äôs as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie, ‚ÄúThe Big Short.‚Äù These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO‚Äôs.

So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital, trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares.

This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality, **they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one, and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money**

# Now to talk about the current squeeze

It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with **Infinite risk**. This is how short squeezes happen, if the price is driven up, the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender, which then further increases the price of a share, and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze.

The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze. Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post, at $215/share, but it‚Äôs price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up.

# But here is the the important part

The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed, the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the **synthetic shares only become ‚Äúreal‚Äù when the short position completely closes or is margin called.**

This means, the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number.

So you don‚Äôt need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous, once the synthetic shares come to fruition.

We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares, and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money. But that doesn‚Äôt stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares.

So The MM‚Äôs are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now, except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb.

# Now why it‚Äôs scary for the rest of the market

So if you‚Äôve been following to this point, you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic. 

**Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation... I don‚Äôt think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts. The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in this short position.**

So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs (I‚Äôm talking in the billions of dollars) across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee, and I don‚Äôt think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost.

I believe, with great conviction, when GME truly takes off it will cause, a major market-wide correction across all sectors.

# The Conclusion

Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals (maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market).

I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because ~~the way these contract expiry dates are usually set~~ the number of option contracts set around those dates. And It‚Äôs possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time.

However, I can say 2 things with absolute certainty

* We are witnessing history, this whole thing is already resulting in many academic studies, further government intervention, and future movies/documentaries
* **There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again.**

I do not care what broker you have, fidelity, E\*TRADE, Schwab, or robinhood, etc.  They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys (and very possibly sells) just like RH did on January 28th. When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS

**And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion, I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing.** The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January. 

# THIS WILL NOT BE THE BROKERS FAULT, THE MARKET MAKERS AND HEDGE FUNDS SHOULD BE THE ONES FOOTING THE BILL, EVEN IF THAT MEANS SELLING OFF EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THEIR BUILDING TO DO SO.

Mainstream Brokers only have so much money to provide the liquidity needed to move billions of trades a day, they are not equipped to deal with something this insane.

# So Why did I type up this long ass post?

If you think I‚Äôm just a crazy person, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt take it personally. I‚Äôm just making this post because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months. I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders.

I know GME is a ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù so it‚Äôs easy to discredit and it‚Äôs fun watching this David vs Goliath story but I believe this will have very real effects across the whole market so proceed with caution on your trades until this squeeze reaches a conclusion, **ESPECIALLY IF YOU DEAL WITH NAKED OPTIONS**

If you read this whole thing, thanks. Please let me know if there is any corrections I should make.

TLDR: just skim the bold points ya lazy fuck lol

Edit: gonna have to turn off notifications now lol. So I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt reply, maybe later. 

But most importantly I‚Äôm no professional, I‚Äôm just a guy with an interest in the world of finance. So don‚Äôt take this post as gospel. I wanted to start this thread for the discussion and while I do strongly personally believe the MOASS is real, I appreciated the counter points.

Thanks for the laughs and genuine discussion

April 6th Edit: I fear this post may have underestimated just how bad the coming economic crash will be. I now realize how this is all bigger than GameStop.

133,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years",23771,mbx510,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/,2499," WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

We had people celebrating this is the week. I‚Äôve saw those comments over and over all weekend. If I‚Äôm seeing it, so are the hedgies. March 19th has been marked on our calendar for weeks. EXPECT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO! 

If this was poker, we are literally showing our hands before we go all in. The hedgies are seeing our cards and folding just to prolong this squeeze.

We just need to continue to be patient and buy what we can afford and most importantly HOLD! 

The numbers are on our side. All they are trying to do is cause fear and doubt. They NEED OUR SHARES!

This is not financial advise, this is üíéüôåü¶ç advice.

Edit 1: So I‚Äôm been getting a lot of comments about me being a shill, hedgie, bot, etc... So let me end this retardness

Yes, I joined Reddit 41 days ago. The same day Mark Cuban came here to chat with us. I like some apes here bought GME in January out of fomo. I saw the stock go up and then crash down to the 50s. I‚Äôm usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to ‚Äúget rich quick.‚Äù When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to ‚ÄúHOLD!‚Äù I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I‚Äôve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it‚Äôs much much more. It‚Äôs NOT about ME, it‚Äôs about ü¶ç. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn‚Äôt agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you‚Äôre just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I‚Äôm trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there‚Äôs more than one way to help the cause than buying.

So some of y‚Äôall can continue to criticize me, I really don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm going to continue to help and educate others.

Finally if that story isn‚Äôt convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. 

Hopefully that convinces the naysayers that I‚Äôm a üíéüôåü¶ç!",2021-03-15 22:50:51

169,I‚Äôve lost everything because of the Suez Canal fiasco on the Egyptian/ European Easter bunny future run up,19176,mdpi46,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdpi46/ive_lost_everything_because_of_the_suez_canal/,1554,"I spent $50,000 on surefire Egyptian bunny rabbit futures. This was money that was supposed to be saved for buying a new house and was mainly accrued from dumping pay checks into SPY over the years. 

On the 27th of February , I got tipped off from a buddy that works in the bunny breeding industry. He said that due to the pandemic, Europeans were buying pets like crazy, and one animal in particular... bunny rabbits. 

Now this made me look into Egyptian bunny futures as they produce the most bunnies in the world. The premiums were amazing, this was like buying fucking apple at IPO. On top of all of this, Easter was just a couple months around the corner and a massive shipment of bunnies was meant to leave Egypt and make its way to a port in France. I‚Äôm talking a fucking boat load of carrot munching, sex hungry, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up doc‚Äù mother fuckers, not just a container. 

So I placed my bet, expiring the week of Easter, for when the shipment would come. Since there were barely any bunnies in France/ all of Europe, there was no supply to meet demand. However, I had it on good authority that prices would barely drop since so many Europeans wanted the little fluffy fucks. 

All was going well, my money was going up and it was the most euphoric feeling ever...

Until on Wednesday at 10am, I wake up to check how many unrealized tendies I have. To my horror I was down 48%. I frantically called my aforementioned buddy in the industry and he tells me to look up the Suez canal. 

It turns out the shipment was delayed by a day out of Egypt and right after they left port, some big fucking ship decided to block the whole canal. Since Egypt shipped out essentially every last bunny in the damn country, they didn‚Äôt need any more bunny food. So every single one of them is going to run out of food over the next week and die on that ship (no point in bringing them back to port cause there‚Äôs no food to feed them). Once they arrive in France they will dump the dead bunnies, pick up the next shipment and move on. 

Idk how I‚Äôm going to tell my wife this, probably gonna need some protection from her boyfriend for a while too.

Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking

*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.

**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:

1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.
2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.

**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.

In a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.

**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**

Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.

&#x200B;

[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https://preview.redd.it/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)

&#x200B;

*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*

***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***

Just taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**

Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.

**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.

**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.

**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.

The Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's

ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.

**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.

&#x200B;

[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https://preview.redd.it/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)

[ETF's being shorted in the past](https://preview.redd.it/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)

&#x200B;

Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. 

**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**

When faced with ""excessive buying"" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as ""Naked"" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are ""making markets"" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.

**TLDR**

**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**

&#x200B;

GME steadily has been producing some great gains this week, opening Monday bright and early at 154.89 and finally opening today at 269, looking poised to make our moonshot. Unfortunately, after peaking above 330, after a series of trading halts, plummeted down to 198, with restabilization by EOD.

To the unexperienced eye and paper hands, this looks like a time to sell.

# However...

To the experienced trader, this is a textbook Salmon chart. Lemme explain it clearly to the retarded paper hands here.

The Sockeye Salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway. It begins as a massive dip that goes below red (to match the color of breeding Sockeye), then some wacky shit for the ventral fin, and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish, in the green for approaching the head.

# But what about the natural predator of salmon coming to spawn?

&#x200B;

[That‚Äôs right, gay bears are behind this shit.](https://i.redd.it/4qpbtglkpbm61.gif)

Bears the natural antithesis of salmon, and gay bears the antithesis of the retail traders. But how have the gay bears forced the stock to plummet? What manipulation did they have this time?

# You may be familiar to ladder attacks, but let me introduce you to fish ladder attacks.

Ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth, despite hedge funds preventing direct, uninhibited access.

# Hedgefunds have stationed gay bears at the ladders to eat the incoming paperhanded salmon, which was the primary driver in today‚Äôs major crash.

If you wanted a definitive proof about who CNBC plays for, we got ya, retards. Thanks to eagle sight of¬†u/luxieto¬†and help from¬†u/halinxHalo¬†we got not one, but two pieces of evidence that CNBC doesn't shy from raw and pure manipulation.

Original video:¬†/watch?v=imRzHXRq80I¬†- duration 04:37:06

CNBC video:¬†/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM¬†- duration 04:17:58

We're missing about 20 minutes.

""Ahh, you crayon-eating poop-brain, they edited out all the cuts, breaks and stuff like that"" I hear you saying. Yep! But also, CNBC fucks also did some extra shillwork on it.

At 02:38:19 (original video) - French Hill comes on and during his 5 minutes, he has doubts about separation of Citadel's businesses.¬†In the CNBC version THERE IS NO FRENCH HILL. ERASED.

At 02:45:59 (original video) - Cindy Axne comes on and during her 5 minutes asks about RH and Citadel's spreads, business practices.¬†CNBC keeps about 5% of her time in their version of the video, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS CUT.

You can go check it out yourselves, it's there for everybody to see.

We already knew they weren't clean, but tampering with a congressional hearing video? Is it just me or do you also smell desperation?

248,True Short interest in GEE EM EE could be anywhere from 250% to 967% of the float. Yes short sellers are that fucking retarded.,13398,m19sa7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/,1219,"So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or ""math"" for you americans, or ""fun hobby time"" for our chinese autists) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<

""So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qvqwl2rw31m61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb1fbc9c5fbb7971d179d9f982ad75d54287d63

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

&#x200B;

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.""

I have been doing this for 1 month now and I'm 2k up, I really think this is the new way to build your portfolio with stocks.

It all started when I was thinking about my trading history, every fucking time I got wrecked. If I close a buy order, the stock usually goes down, the same way for a sell order, when I sell usually goes up. So I was thinking very hard on this, how could this binary outcome be so hard to achieve? Well, I invented a new way to build your portfolio so you will be 100% safe, I call it the B.R.T (Bait Retard Trades).

BRT - How does it work?

You will not do trading any different, you will continue to do your stupid trades, but this time you will use only up to 30% of your portfolio on your own trading ideas, and the other 70% you will use to perform the exact opposite. Warning! This will only work if you are honest with yourself, you should really think about what you think is best to use with your 30%, don't cheat and think the opposite just to use that on the 70%, you must trust the fact that you are actually retarded and don't know what you are doing, therefore the opposite position of your genuine choice will be the best. For example, last week I was thinking about getting some calls on PLTR that expires in a week, for many reasons I thought this was the best decision, so I did 30% of calls on PLTR and 70% on puts, made some money on the fact that I don't know what I'm doing. Being retarded gives you a superpower, you ALWAYS have the answer, it's just not what you think it is, it's the exact opposite.",2021-03-08 06:47:54

# Chapter 1: Gamestop‚Äôs Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Let‚Äôs start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431

And this is the key misstep the HF‚Äôs made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They‚Äôve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can‚Äôt easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it‚Äôs expensive). They can‚Äôt move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn‚Äôt owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it‚Äôs stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn‚Äôt bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.

Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.

# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092

So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he‚Äôs just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy‚Äôs online sales figures under Cohen to project what‚Äôs to come for Gamestop in the next few years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e

That‚Äôs right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.

Gamestop Announced in it‚Äôs Q4 earnings report last week what it‚Äôs intentions are... *‚ÄúOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.‚Äù*

Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...

&#x200B;

# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales

If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it‚Äôs money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon‚Äôs market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723

Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it‚Äôs website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon‚Äôs growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn‚Äôt bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.

So let‚Äôs get to the fun part‚Ä¶ valuation

&#x200B;

# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I‚Äôll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.

Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let‚Äôs look at the figures anyway and then I‚Äôll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it‚Äôs valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm‚Ä¶ why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop‚Äôs move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now‚Ä¶ it would move it‚Äôs price to approximately $5,157 a share. That‚Äôs not a squeeze number. That‚Äôs simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f

So let‚Äôs get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I‚Äôve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you‚Äôll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it‚Äôs P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You‚Äôll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it‚Äôs transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it‚Äôs online business, it‚Äôs P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.

&#x200B;

# Final Chapter: Conclusions

Ok you‚Äôve been patient, and I told you I‚Äôd eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn‚Äôt caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it‚Äôs deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?

Well **$191**, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs trading at. It‚Äôs only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don‚Äôt know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn‚Äôt buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It‚Äôs because of quality, and support for the brand.

Lots of things are increasing Gamestop‚Äôs valuation, but growth of it‚Äôs online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I‚Äôm giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop‚Äôs online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is‚Ä¶ an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.

Project these figures onto Gamestop as you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it‚Äôs Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it‚Äôs finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it‚Äôs per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years‚Ä¶ Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you‚Äôre wondering how that‚Äôs possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another‚Ä¶

I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).

Here is a teaser‚Ä¶ When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it‚Äôs price north of $31,800 on it‚Äôs way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).

If you needed one more reason to HODL, it‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife‚Äôs boyfriend lost your password couldn‚Äôt get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.

And if you‚Äôve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects‚Ä¶ I think I figured it out

Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**

Don‚Äôt lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let‚Äôs make the world a better place.

Not financial advice.

I don‚Äôt know how the stock market works.

I don‚Äôt know how companies or their fundamentals work.

293,An Illiad of GME Technical Analysis and DD,11094,ma4oeo,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4oeo/an_illiad_of_gme_technical_analysis_and_dd/,879,"Apes, gorillas, cucks, tards, and degenerates gather round, Uncle Hank has some more technical DD to bestow on your smooth brains. Please ~~bear~~ bull with me, because this will be long. Some of you have probably seen my other posts and this will be much the same; however, this technical analysis will be more in-depth and will cover a wider ranger of indicators than previous posts. I am a technical trader and these are the indicators that I have used in the past and that I have found helpful, but this is in no way exhaustive and there are many other indicators and trading styles that are just as useful as these. Finally, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, my brain is literally a senile amoeba. As you can probably tell, I have an ADHD medicine prescription. I worked very hard on this and hope that you apes enjoy it!

**Volume - catalysts**

I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:

https://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e

&#x200B;

Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase."" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:

https://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7

&#x200B;

The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like ""ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button""). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:

https://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189

https://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601

https://preview.redd.it/dzq9bkxqrfo61.png?width=171&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b11369d73f5a62f36b5cbaf5ee82194a4b7457

&#x200B;

So, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of ""the squeeze might happen here"" or ""the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming"" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.

**OBV**

""But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes."" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba

&#x200B;

So what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.

So, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.

**SPY and VIX**

Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):

Though the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.

**Support and resistance**

https://preview.redd.it/slo3fv3wrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f924e3df995fb61353f38129c591ccf86a835

&#x200B;

In this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.

**Current patterns**

Looking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:

https://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da

&#x200B;

As you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26

&#x200B;

That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42

As you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/z0fiv5g1sfo61.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90c277e9796d2d5485c1633a522c18d7d85cdae

**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**

Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e

The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:

https://preview.redd.it/i1bonxi3sfo61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0067ba6738df71b367ff56765f3fbb6de790e53

These three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.

**A note about the ""short attacks""**

As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**

The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**A Note about squeezes**

Before I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.

**Why short interest might not matter**

If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.

**FTD Squeeze**

I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.

**Closing Thots**

In short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account. I have always loved investing and trading, but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy. Thanks a ton apes, stay strong.",2021-03-21 22:57:14
294,HEY CRAYON MUNCHERS: Want to know WHY the GME chart looks like this? Shitadel & Max Pain Theory.,11048,m8ef72,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ef72/hey_crayon_munchers_want_to_know_why_the_gme/,1232,"&#x200B;

[Image is copied from one of u\/chayse1984's posts](https://preview.redd.it/j1sd6jde3yn61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d1d406b6d0ccc0b7b53c4f94f0cad9ee6d336a)

Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason, and it's not all *Brownian Motion* you stochastic cucks.

So we got two big fucking triangles up here, but do you even know *why*? Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.

It's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.

Almost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.

Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.

This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. ""Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?""

[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)

In PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.

You heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.

*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*

[From https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)

*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*

[An obvious short attack. https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)

*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***

Remember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.

# Boom.

\----- P.S. -----

Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**

Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this? Buy leaps on Fridays like these, and ~~sell~~ not buy weeklies during bull flags like this.

&#x200B;

Tldr; Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.  If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS. üöÄüöÄüöÄs on  üöÄüöÄüöÄs on  üöÄüöÄüöÄs.

295,Stop being robbed of call premium for the mirage of a gamma squeeze,10905,m9229p,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/,1129,"This advice was posted here countless times and yet here we go again. If implied volatility is over 100-200%, there's very little money to be made with calls. Your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze? Well it won't fucking happen if you're paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.

You would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.

It pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions. Yes this is a casino, but at least act like you're trying to win damnit.

Look at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

Secondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.

**Case 2 : MACD**

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.

&#x200B;

 

**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**

From last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

**Final Thoughts**

There are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or ""In The Money"". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.

This also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.

The technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL. Don't be scared with dips as long as the trend is your friend. **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**",2021-03-08 23:50:57

If regulators or Congress had a sense of the volumes of OTC options on GME that traded in periods of high volatility, that would give some insight into their overall footprint in the volatility.

Listen up, apes.  I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen.  Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it.  Now, I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal, or really anything with meaningful content, so let's just talk about card games.

How do casinos make money on poker?  For each hand of poker played, the casino takes a small percentage of the pot, which is called the rake.  The casino provides the establishment and the dealers, the players play, and the casino takes its commission.  Okay, great, but what the fuck does this have to do with GME?  We're getting there.  Hang on.  The edging is real, but you'll get your payoff.

So the casino takes its cut from each pot.  The more money in the pot, the more money the casino makes.  Great.  How do they maximize profits?  Well, they can bring in more players, get players to play longer, deal more hands per hour, and/or increase the average size of the pots.  I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these, because it doesn't matter.  What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains.  The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money, you just need to understand their business model.

Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots.  There are tons of ways to do this, but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino, you're at a local back-alley gambling spot.   Their operation isn't super sophisticated.  They just install a few of their cronys into each game.  Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals: bring people in, loosen up the tables, and create big pots.   As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table (and lose it), the house will profit.

There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet.  No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money, right?  Well, that's not entirely true.  In fact, it's not at all true.  Then why the fuck did I mention it?  Well, you tell me, why the fuck would you play a rigged game?

Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham, if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth, they will still play.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  In fact, it's even a good thing for the house when ""dumb money"" make money; this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends.  They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.

The house wants you to play.  The house wants your friends to play.  The house wants everyone to play.  So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play?  Did you fucking read the last paragraph?  It's simple: you make it the best way for anyone to make money.  You essentially force them to play.  Don't get lost in the details.   It doesn't matter how this is accomplished.  They can lick you, suck you, fuck you, beat you, squeeze you, whack the other competition off, etc.  All that matters is that whatever game they run, it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery.

So what happens when players make too much money?  I don't know, what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code?  What happens when the sheep start misbehaving?  A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep, but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame.  Again, the game is rigged, and  the minions have one fucking job: follow the script and don't get too greedy.  Any problem, and I mean any problem, is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood.  

Reddit is an enormous echo chamber.  Shit gets loud in here, but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME, most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big, they're not going to care.  They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery.

So what the hell am I actually saying about GME?  The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused, but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand.  There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some ""Epsteins,"" but as long as the apes don't fold, the apes win this round.  If the mobsters play this game right, they'll fold this hand, take their losses, and (as usual) end up winning in the long run.  They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff.  This is EZ mode.

Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine?  It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family, a bigly minion, or even the fucking godfather.  You live by the sword, you die by the sword.  When you have an infected limb, you first try to treat it, but if that doesn't work, you cut that shit off.  These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own--I'm sure that some of them even prefer it.  The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder, and the cannibals are going to feast.

So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

# üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çü¶çüåôüíéüëê

First, let's look at the players involved here.

# The shorts

On the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.

# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)

Marker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the ""fools"" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).

# The longs

On the long side, we have you glorious apes  ü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.

Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this.

It all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.

[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)

[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.

# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze

Some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).

First, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))

Now, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.

At some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.

Similarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.

Remember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.

You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.

# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?

Some people ask: ""Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?"" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).

In fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be ""name your price"" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.

# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:

**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**

~~Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in~~. That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant.",2021-03-10 14:22:01

 it's in the 10-K as plain as day. It reads "" A ""short squeeze"" due to a sudden increase in demand for our class A common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A common stock.

Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposure. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common Stock available for our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A common Stock for deliver to lenders of our Class

I don't have time for an EndGame part 7 dd. However I believe there are a number of catalysts leading up to earnings. 

1) Cohen as ceo 
Sherman's been ceo for exactly 2 years now. Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. 

Cohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can't sell easily as an insider). It's in sherman's best interests to get out and get liquid on what could be a billion dollar nest egg.

In 2019 Sherman was announced as CEO 5 days BEFORE earnings. 

2) Debt 
GMEs 2021 bond matures in 4 days. Potential credit rating impact. 

3) Potential 3/19 DTCC changes forcing brokers to force close short positions or at least shore up capital (could negatively impact longs as well, unsure here though)

4) IV will likely spike in calls just before earnings

5) cohen's tweeting

Maybe your portfolio took a hit or something happened at work. Here's how to deal with it, without being a dick to your loved ones. 

For starters, acknowledge that you're probably going to be touchy, things might set you off. So you're going to need to destress.

Go home, eat a snack, kiss your wife or hug your kids. Now go and do something nice for them. Take out the trash, empty the dish washer, do some chore that you've been putting off. It'll help. I don't know why it helps, but it does.

I think out ape brains can't really weight things objectively so getting a small win offsets a greater loss. 

Now, do something for you or just relax. It is what it is. If your partner wants to talk about it, talk with them. But you don't have to fix it today. All you have to do is not be a dick to the ones that love you.",2021-03-16 23:14:10

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

&#x200B;

The actual important shit:

1.) They are running out of ammo, those drops had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They‚Äôre running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame.

2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this far up in the share price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now. This is potentially a good thing because it means no influx of uneducated monkeys who know jack shit.

3.) We need educate new members of this fuck wagon on what is going on. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.

Side note: NEWBIES! YOU‚ÄôLL KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING! IT WILL FUCKING SKYROCKET *$5000+ MINIMUM. DONT SELL (unless you have to I know everyone has varying circumstances) DONT BUY UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A HIGH VOLATILITY STOCK. SHIT GOES UP DOWN BACK FORWARD, FUCKING BACKFLIPS. Stop asking stupid shit and hold on

TLDR; Remove your stop losses. Weaponize the newly born apes. Everything has led to now. The media has sorta fucked off, paper hands are long gone. The shorts have one bullet in the gun and they‚Äôre saving it to shoot themselves in the mouth. Hang on and have fun. Love you apes

""BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1""

Well, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.

Now that the captain is gone, let's get to business.

[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https://preview.redd.it/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)

I know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  
What you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  
That was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.

Allrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.

Good boy/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.

Ok, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.

I hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  


I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.

Because they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.

You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? Sure, *if you want to lose your title of millionaire*. However, if you 'd like to stay a millionaire, there are some things you may like to consider. *This is not financial advice,* but rather, 3 pieces of life suggestions. A survival guide so to speak, of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title.

&#x200B;

* First, protect it from everyone else.

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well everyone is gonna want a cut. They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not the harm they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

In that case, you've gotta be the bad guy. You've gotta be the one to say, ""no."" And friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. *Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

* Second, protect it from expenses.

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a source of *income.* An easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to poverty. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

* Third, protect it from yourself.

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per part 1.**Don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners, roughly 35% of which go *bankrupt*. Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

&#x200B;

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

&#x200B;

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America.

https://i.redd.it/6zrwsfsstlm61.gif

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of either decision.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

&#x200B;

Oh who am I kidding. This is WallStreetBets. You will all be fine. Just be careful, my friends. As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life.

&#x200B;

Edit: While I mentioned it in point 3, it should absolutely be a point of it's own. So, by popular demand...

&#x200B;

* Fourth, protect it from the government.

Roughly 40% of earnings is going to go to the federal government if you're earning over 1,000,000. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""ouch"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!",2021-03-12 16:06:36

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¬¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¬¢ more, the buyer gets 3¬¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¬¢ instead of 8¬¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

The last time it was blocked was in 1967. What happened in 1967? Ships heading to Europe from Asia had to go around the horn of Africa, adding up to 12,000 miles to their journey. 

This meant that the crews had to stop along the way for fuel and provisions. They stopped at the biggest port in Africa which was in South Africa. Many companies also offloaded goods at a discount in South Africa.

 This sent the entire economy of South Africa into hyperdrive. Look at a GDP chart for south africa and you'll see the huge jump in 1967. Their stock market rallied because of it too.

The same dynamic is playing out today. Suez canal has been blocked for 4 days. It is likely to be blocked for MONTHS. That means a lot of ships will be stopping in South Africa,  sending their economy to the moon for thhe first time since the 1960s.

The guy who was trying to short south Africa ETFs a while back had some solid DD, but the suez canal blockage is about to suck all the money out of his brokerage account. That ship has been there for 4 days and there is no sign that it will be out soon. Most likely it will be MONTHS of losses for him.

I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!

Edit:
[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6)

I obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. 

For you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. ""A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy"". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. 

I thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.",2021-03-10 21:13:40

However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*

&#x200B;

So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.

Fear.

Slowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!

&#x200B;

*""What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?""*

This guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.

&#x200B;

*""Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?""*

Great question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.

So, without further ado, let us begin.

\-----

# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival

Chapter 1

Protecting it from everyone else

&#x200B;

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, ‚Äúlook at Moneybags over here‚Äù, ‚Äúmust be nice‚Äù, or ‚Äúremember the little guy‚Äù, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You‚Äôll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)

On top of that, they‚Äôre gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.

They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

By that point, you‚Äôve lost. You‚Äôre stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, ‚Äúno‚Äù. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

There's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can‚Äôt take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.

*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Protecting it from expenses

&#x200B;

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Protecting it from yourself

&#x200B;

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

\-----

# Part 2 - Economic Survival

Chapter 1

Taxes

&#x200B;

Roughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""*ouch*"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!

With that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Debt

&#x200B;

If you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.

Now, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

FIRE

&#x200B;

FIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.

Now, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.

This would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:

* **Lean FIRE** \- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year
* **Fat FIRE** \- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)
* **Barista FIRE** \- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.
* **Coast FIRE** \- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Investments

&#x200B;

Before I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...

I believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*

**Stock Market** \- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.

**Real Estate** \- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.

**Businesses** \- ""Small business is the backbone of our economy."" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.

\-----

# Part 3 - What Comes Next?

Chapter 1

Spending

&#x200B;

Alright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Building a cabinet

&#x200B;

Now, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Giving

&#x200B;

And now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.

&#x200B;

Chapter 4

Sources for you to perform your own Due Diligence

&#x200B;

In this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!

[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.

[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.

\-----

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***""The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.""***

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

GameStop's 10-K disclosure:

March 23, 2021, GameStop announces an undisclosed ""large proportion"" of their stock is shorted:

""Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. **To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.** Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù

**A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze.** A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.""

OK. You've made it this far. Does history repeat itself? Yes, it can. Does history rhyme (as in, does it *seem* eerily similar.) Yes, it can.

HERE'S THE RUB \[Hint: It's in the comparison of how they hinted at short sellers\]:

GME:

To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, **investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common** Stock.

VW:

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven‚Äôt blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you‚Äôre down, that‚Äôs understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we‚Äôve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It‚Äôs like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It‚Äôs gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it‚Äôll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don‚Äôt worry. Basics are super simple and I won‚Äôt confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you‚Äôre not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I‚Äôm sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we‚Äôre going to cover today.

You‚Äôre gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda

Let‚Äôs step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We‚Äôre gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it‚Äôs 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we‚Äôre going to add to our chart what‚Äôs proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. ü§Ø

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There‚Äôs a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we‚Äôre seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that‚Äôs a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here‚Äôs the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. ‚ÄúIf I were to hold two more days, I could‚Äôve doubled my money‚Äù.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it‚Äôs close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would‚Äôve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don‚Äôt look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We‚Äôre stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It‚Äôs simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I‚Äôm not touching TSLA. I‚Äôm not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That‚Äôs gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, ‚ÄúShit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?‚Äù

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It‚Äôs a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

ùïπùñäùñúùñôùñîùñì'ùñò ùï∑ùñÜùñú ùñîùñã ùñÄùñìùñéùñõùñäùñóùñòùñÜùñë ùï≤ùñóùñÜùñõùñéùñôùñÜùñôùñéùñîùñì (ùì£ùì±ùìÆ ùìêùìπùìÆ ùìõùì™ùîÄ)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>g‚Çë = GM‚Çë/R‚Çë¬≤

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s¬≤ and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>g‚Çë = (6.67 \* 10‚Åª¬π¬π N‚Ä¢m¬≤/kg¬≤)(6.0\*10¬≤‚Å¥ kg(/(6.4\*10‚Å∂m)¬≤  
>  
>g‚Çë = 9.8 m/s¬≤

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually ùï≠ùñéùñå ùïØùñöùñíùñá ùïØùñöùñíùñáùñò who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>g‚Çë = GM‚Çë/R‚Çë¬≤

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GM‚Çë= g‚Çë \* R‚Çë¬≤

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""‚Çë's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE¬≤

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [ü§Ø](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [ü§Ø](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [ü§Ø](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [ü§Ø](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29¬≤  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us. 

&#x200B;

His Law of Universal Gravitation was never about forces that would pull things down to Earth, it was about things that would rocket past the moon  [üöÄ](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [üöÄ](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [üöÄ](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

Many people wait for his famous ""YOLO UPDATE"" that he posts every now and then.

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

One of the secrets to his success was... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

I won't let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).

No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.

I will **hold.**

*Edit: This is not just about GME, this is a general discussion*

*Edit II: Guys I'm not saying that diamond handing was all there is to DFV's success. Of course his extraordinary DD and his education did most of the work, but that doesn't mean that it was easy to hold through the tough times.

Technical Analysis doesn't mean too much to GME, but it certainly tells us something. I think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the Earnings Report coming later today. Here are some a few key indicators why GME can and will go up dramatically soon.

&#x200B;

[1 Hour Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/007anng09to61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff7be90f38ab719c4288d31a1ff33f04b32cd8f)

&#x200B;

1. **RSI -** The first point I'd like to touch on is RSI. As you can see, the RSI is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when GME was making it's comeback from the drop to $40. Now look at the RSI **AT THE SAME PRICE** today and you'll see that we are heading towards being oversold. What does this mean? It's simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase.

2. **Trend -** In terms of the month, we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks. From the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend. Now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area, it's starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area. The current trend we are in is a Bullish Descending Triangle, much like the Pennant we saw earlier.

3. **Volume -** With GME, when volume goes up, price goes up. If you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up, the price tends to skyrocket. Right now volume is extremely low, a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further.

4. **Turning Point -** With the RSI, Trend, and Volume all pointing towards future rapid growth, I'm inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon. I do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point, and the only way I see it getting to that area is MASSIVE short selling to artificially drop the price.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** The technicals point toward GME skyrocketing in the near future. Take this all with a grain of salt though, the price could very well drop below the areas I've mentioned before going up. Above all else **HODL** and the tendies shall come!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE - 3/23/2021 - 6:58 ET:** Looks like the price was driven down after a relatively good earnings report, can't say it was totally unexpected but it certainly threw many of us off. The price was starting to break upwards only to be violently thrown downwards. iborrowdesk shows that 50k shares were borrowed and likely contributed to this selling pressure. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

The price did bounce off of $150 like previously mentioned after getting down to around 15-20 RSI. They're now in a very oversold territory, but it wouldn't surprise me if they kept trying to artificially lower the price. The shorts aren't going to give up so easily. So **HOOOOODLLLLL** fellow apes.

``````New Edit 3/23``````

**3/23** - Breaking news this morning, [SEC filings indicate](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-21-090320) that Gamestop Chief Customer officer Frank Hamlin is stepping down after a transition ending 31 March. Who could possibly replace him? How about Kelli Durkin, Chewy‚Äôs prior Vice President of Customer Service who was [brought on with Gamestop March 1 as Senior VP of Customer Care](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer). There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.

No known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

**Editing to include some new info I dug up regarding the board members who will not be standing for re-election at the next board meeting.

542,$GME DD : Technical Analysis shows Very Strong Buy Signals,4432,m17zsb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m17zsb/gme_dd_technical_analysis_shows_very_strong_buy/,266,"#  Intro

Welcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.

# Pivot Point

The pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**

For example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,

&#x200B;

[Example Candlestick Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)

&#x200B;

R1 = (2 x Pivot Point) ‚Äì Daily Low

R2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High ‚Äì Daily Low)

S1 = (2 x Pivot Point) ‚Äì Daily High

S2 = Pivot Point ‚Äì (Daily High ‚Äì Daily Low)

*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point ‚Äì Daily Low)*

*S3 = Daily Low ‚Äì 2 x (Daily High ‚Äì Pivot Point)*

**LINKING BACK TO GME**

&#x200B;

[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)

&#x200B;

GME-

Resistance Line 1: $195.13

Resistance Line 2: 202.33

Resistance Line 3: 215.87

*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**

*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*

# Relative Strength Index

*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100

RSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence

Above 70: Overbought

&#x200B;

[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)

Current GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)

*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*

**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**

**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**

&#x200B;

[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)

&#x200B;

RSI Value: 72.14

As seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.

# Volume Weighted Average Price

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.¬†*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**

*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*

&#x200B;

[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)

&#x200B;

* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**
* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.
* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security‚Äôs price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**

&#x200B;

[MACD january](https://preview.redd.it/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[MACD march](https://preview.redd.it/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)

&#x200B;

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD‚Äôs baseline.

* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*

# Other Indicators

Since I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.

&#x200B;

[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**

Anyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**

544,THE MYTHICAL UNICORN AKA EXTREMELY ABNORMAL negative beta of GME evidence that shorts have NOT covered,4422,m6if56,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/,501," **TLDR** \- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

At 16 March 2021.

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).

I've updated the gamma squeeze calculator to include all the option chains until 2023 and removed the 3/5 expired ones, it now contains a total of 2,603 strikes and expiries. I have also added several new parameters to address shortcomings that others had pointed out. If for example you wish to only include strikes that will expire ITM in that week, now you can do it via the filters.

The calculator can be used to simulate several projected delta hedging scenarios under different forecasted prices with the time value as a parameter

We see from the cover that even using very conservative parameters, MMs are holding close to 20% of the float just to delta hedge, which might partly explain the high float percentage owned by institutions as displayed on Bloomberg's terminal.

Now ü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç only have limited amount of üçåüçåüçå, ü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç need to ensure each üçå is used for maximum effect. Based on the calculator's BSM modeling, the best delta/price ratio in the options chain across all expiries would be

The 3/12 270C, if apes were to buy one contract, 3.04 x 100 = $304, then MMs would need to hedge 0.137x100x137.74 = $1882 worth of shares to remain delta neutral

Giving an amplification factor of

**1 üçå -> 6 üçå**

OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO-ers ü¶ç , but carry very high risk of ü¶ç loosing all üçå, if 3/12 closing price ends below 270. A safer way for ü¶ç, would probably be ITM calls, somewhere around the 100-110C strike price

Suppose $GME on 3/12 does close above 151, what should ü¶ç do next ? Best would be to exercise those calls, but most ü¶çü¶çü¶ç are poor(because they are ü¶çü¶çü¶ç) and don't have enough powder to exercise calls. The next best thing would be to rollover those calls, selling ü¶ç's calls that are expiring and buying the next week's ITM calls at higher strike, further propagating the gamma squeeze. Here's a graphical illustration of the process

this way, ü¶ç ape can ensure üçå is used to maximum effect, without taking on too much risk while also mitigating the shorts attacks.

ü¶çü¶çü¶ç path to victory is almost ensured, but ü¶ç should be aware that  ü¶ç is not in the final stage yet, ü¶ç still needs to go through MMs first before showdown with üêäüëë in WallStreet.

**Edit 1 :**

**The 3/8 closing price of 194.5 should've triggered an additional 3 million stocks of delta covering, bringing the total stocks bought by MM for delta hedging to 13.5 million(25% of float)**

But either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that ""hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!"", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**

So let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.

# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.

With COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.

Hedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**

While some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...

# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.

People like Michael Burry and Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.

After GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.

Finally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.

# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...

But before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *""short squeeze""* and *""gamma squeeze""* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""short squeeze"" is when lots of people ""short"" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**

**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""gamma squeeze"" happens when many people make lots of  ""call"" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**

**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.**

**If this high volume of ""call"" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SKIP POINT

**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**

# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.

# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...

**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**

# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021

What was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.

# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.

Before more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous ""call"" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.

After all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.

In less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...

# Yet this is not how GME ends.

Just a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.

Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.

During the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**In other words, a ""short squeeze"" hasn't happened yet.**

People found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.

They found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.

Not only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.

Ryan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...

There were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...

People began exercising call options once more, and now...

# The GME rocket rises once again...

# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their ""call"" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.

# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

Possible additional changes to senior executives.,4001,mbqxm9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqxm9/gme_4_additional_board_members_expected_to_leave/,235,"[Buried in the 10-K that Gamestop released today, under ITEM 9B Other Information](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109) are additional upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:



>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**


*This indicates four more board members than previously announced are planning on leaving. Additionally, a little further down there is a caveat under the description of the formation of the Strategic Committee that indicates additional senior executive changes may be in the cards:*


>Our Board of Directors has formed a committee of directors called the ‚ÄúStrategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee‚Äù (the Strategic Committee). The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our operational objectives and corporate strategy, capital allocation priorities and other opportunities for maximizing stockholder value. Our Board, through the Strategic Committee, is currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm to assist it in its evaluation and exploration. **This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of our senior executives.**





*******
`````Updated since some incorrectly believe this is old news`````

Here is the [original section of the 8K filed for the agreement with RC Ventures Jan 11](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) that shows the four additional names listed as leaving today were at that time expected to stand for re-election:


>Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to increase the size of its board of directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) by three directors to a total of 13 directors and appoint Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube (the ‚ÄúNew Directors‚Äù) as members of the Board, each with a term expiring at the Company‚Äôs 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù). The Company has further agreed that, effective at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced by four directors to a total of nine directors. The Board will nominate each of the New Directors (or their replacements appointed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) and **current directors Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner and Kurt Wolf for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting.**

********
Edit 2:
Just spotted another minor change from the same section of the 10-K:

The previous CFO is out as of tomorrow, not the 26th, with the previously mentioned interim CFO picking up his duties until a replacement is announced. Not really new info, just moved the timeframe up 2 days. I wonder if this means there will be a new CFO announcement sooner because his end date moved up, or if it means they are still searching and the interim will be in place for a while.

>Mr. Bell‚Äôs cessation as our Chief Financial Officer and Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh‚Äôs assumption of the role of interim Chief Financial Officer will occur on March 24, 2021

********
Edit 3:
One last edit because I'm seeing a lot of articles coming out in the media where they lean heavily on the fact that Gamestop retains the ability to issue shares:

From [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under 

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

These are the numbers of shorts that HF's can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c

Since then

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**

Data from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

&#x200B;

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

&#x200B;

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

584,National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging,3711,mfxfuo,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/,445,"This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

585,What we experienced today with GME & AMC is confirmation: WE HAVEN'T EVEN LICKED THE FUSE TO START THE MOASS,3680,m2f48d,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2f48d/what_we_experienced_today_with_gme_amc_is/,247,"GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.

**The Hedgefunds**

Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**

**The Media**

The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**

Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

**TL;DR**

Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

588,FINRA Reporting Inaccurate Total Trade Volume,3665,mb72z0,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb72z0/finra_reporting_inaccurate_total_trade_volume/,237,"I used Fintel to gauge the short interest of any given stock because I thought they were reliable. However, with the latest round of orchestrated ""flash crashes"" being done on meme stocks, and Fintel actually reporting lower ""Short Volume Ratio"" afterwards, I set out to find out just what the hell is going on.

Turns out, Fintel gets their Short Volume figure from FINRA's [Daily Short Sale Volume Files](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Through that webpage, you can find short volume data for any stock for any given day. For example, today 2021-03-22, FINRA maintains that GME had a **short volume of 2,358,752** with a **total volume of 3,843,634**. And according to FINRA, Total Volume is defined as ""**share volume of all executed trades during regular trading hours**.""

&#x200B;

[FINRA Daily Short Sale Volume File Format Legend](https://preview.redd.it/l45d11be6po61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4298fe454531bedf29690f7db0bb901785a0c3)

Alright, that's cool and all but what is wrong? Well, the problem is the Total Volume figure reported by FINRA is completely off and the fact that services like Fintel uses FINRA's short volume data to calculate short volume ratio presents inaccurate data to the public.

For example, Fintel is currently reporting a **23%** Short Volume Ratio for GME as of 2021-03-22. The way they calculate Short Volume Ratio is simply take the Short Volume figure from FINRA (**2,358,752**) divided by the Total Volume. Whao, but Fintel is showing **10,054,700** as the Total Volume for GME, what?

[Fintel uses the Short Volume figure from FINRA. Example: 2021-03-22, Short Volume for GME: 2,358,752. However, Fintel disagrees with FINRA in that Fintel uses 10,054,700 as the total volume whereas FINRA maintains GME only had 3,843,634 total volume.](https://preview.redd.it/5g4lhepc7po61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5c94c82d5a01181d73667ebeeb7feed416e25e)

Okay, let see then..

[ Yahoo Finance shows GME had a volume of 9,573,686 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/m3483d888po61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=401ab28bc0b80a29c43d0ec4d358566bb035dae3)

[ WeBull shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/8v5abi8g8po61.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2cab05661faa8c6c1d132baa7eae18f7ebf79b)

[ Robinhood shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/fp0t9tkn8po61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3eacd125e70226892e147187be9189558a4084)

[ Fidelity shows GME had a volume of 10,061,505 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/nrkys7cv8po61.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee32b3251553ab514d1835f9fa0b540e5d9bb27)

You get the picture. Four sources confirmed that GME had a total volume of \~10M on 2021-03-22. Why the hell is FINRA reporting only 3.8M as the total volume? YES, I am aware that FINRA breaks down their report by markets. I specifically did the analysis based on their ""consolidated"" data across markets B *(NASDAQ TRF Chicago)*, Q *(NASDAQ TRF Carteret)* and N *(NYSE TRF)* So, what the hell?

Once I start questioning that, I had to check FINRA's short volume report for a longer time span for GME. Turns out, FINRA has been under-reporting total volume for all tickers since.. ever. Here I compare what FINRA is reporting vs what Yahoo and Fidelity are reporting. (Blue: FINRA, Red: Yahoo and Yellow: Fidelity)

[ GME Total Trading Volume as reported by FINRA, Yahoo & Fidelity \(2021-01-01 to 2021-03-22\) \[Check sources below raw data\]](https://preview.redd.it/wj18e4vpcpo61.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf1121443100b84f7e78e92b7c9c9ceafe96f44)

As you can see, Yahoo and Fidelity pretty much align 100% on what the total volume is, but FINRA ***\_never\_*** reported even remotely close to what others are reporting. Again, keep in mind the FINRA data I used in this analysis is consolidated across markets.

The ramification of using FINRA's short volume and the total volume of what everyone else is reporting is underestimating the short volume ratio. If we go by the total volume reported by FINRA, we actually get 2358752 / 3843634= **61.4%** Short Volume Ratio. However, sites like Fintel uses that 2358752 short volume figure and the total volume \~10M figure, that gives a low **23%** Short Volume Ratio. The difference is dramatic.

**The questions that need to be answered are: what is FINRA reporting? Why do the total volume they report so different than everybody else's? How confident and reliable are their Short Volume data then? If their consolidated data turns out to be not consolidated, are they deceiving the public in that services like Fintel report a fraction of the real Short Volume Ratio as a result?**

For the record, I did check other stocks *(blue chips, meme stocks, EV.. etc.)* FINRA ***\_always\_*** under-report the total volume.

&#x200B;

**EDIT TO ADD:**

[Fintel's definition on short volume.](https://preview.redd.it/8mhntjpp4to61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7285ff634d1f16e313ec990ddc9989509c01f)

Fintel takes the Short Volume figure from FINRA at face value and divided it by a number (total volume) that includes more markets than FINRA does. *(FINRA's total volume reported does not include or align with exchange volume and they only count trades that are ""publicly disseminated"")*

In the end, we learn that the data from FINRA is not complete *(perhaps there will never be a single source of truth when it comes to market data.)* and should not be taken at face value. You can use it to maybe gauge market direction, but it can not be used to accurately calculate the short volume ratio. *(Since, well.. both the numerator and denominator are subsets of the whole population. It is sampling at best. And sampling is well, sampling. It is not meant to be 100% accurate.)*

&#x200B;

TL;DR: FINRA allegedly report ~~inaccurate~~ **incomplete** total volume in their Short Sale Volume daily report and services like Fintel uses them and as a result gives **inaccurate** short volume ratio.

At the same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they won't be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and Harriman won't sell their shares. The shorts were squeezed as they fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to $240. To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the whole stock market. Overwhelming cries of ""sell! sell! sell!"" were heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when rumors of Morgan's broker's death were spread, but quickly dissipated and the panic resumed.

That's where votes on decisions about GME will happen. It might all go exactly as RC wants. If the Board agrees to decisions then big changes can happen then.  If the Board does not agree then the changes Ryan Cohen wants can still happen but not until after the Standstill period ends which would be around March 1, 2022.

[Agreement between GameStop and Ryan Cohen - January 11, 2021 8-K ](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html#a101-gamestopxsettlementag.htm)

**Shares**

As of January 11, 2021  Ryan Cohen owned 9,001,000 shares, or approximately 12.9% of the Common Stock issued.

This percentage matters because when someone owns 15% of GME then they are an ""interested stockholder"" and there are burdensome legal requirements and restrictions on activities between the large shareholder and the company. [The agreement](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html#a101-gamestopxsettlementag.htm) expands the percentage to 20% without triggering this.  In exchange RC is agreeing to not do a hostile takeover.

Note the difference of 12.9% - 9,001,000 shares and 19.9% shares - ~13,930,000 We don't know if or when RC will purchase shares up to this limit.

**Composition of the Board of Directors**

- The Board temporarily increased from 10 to 13 directors, This created three vacancies filled by Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube.  The terms expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting probably in June 2021

- Mr. Attal was appointed to the Compensation Committee of the Board, Mr. Cohen was appointed to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and Mr. Grube was appointed to the Audit Committee of the Board,

- Current Board members Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck will not stand for reelection at the Annual Meeting.

- The planned slate of director nominees for the Annual Meeting are: Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, Jim Grube, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner, and Kurt Wolf.

- If a Board member must be replaced during the Standstill Period and RC owns at least 4.0% of the Company‚Äôs then-outstanding Common Stock and (y) 2,789,878 shares of Common Stock RC can recommend a person to be on the board (clairfication: to replace RC, Attal, Grube or other Replacement Board members - if needed.  Thanks u/OG_Kushions)

- Ryan Cohen is not accepting any compensation as a Board member

- RC cannot seek, alone or in concert with others, representation on the Board, except as specifically permitted

From u/YouAreAPyrate

- The Slate of Board Members is not definitive. [From the 3/23/21 ER](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109)
 
>As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck. The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.  

**Ryan Cohen agreed to a Standstill Period.**

Standstill Provision

From January 11, 2021 until either 30 days before the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company‚Äôs 2022 annual meeting OR 120 days before the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting whichever is first.  So around March 1, 2022

*Calculation of time* 
If the meeting is June 1, 2022 and the nominations must be submitted 60 days before that April 1 then the 30 days prior to that would mean March 1, 2022
or 

If the meeting is June 1, 2022 the 120 days before that is March 1.

**Limits on what Ryan Cohen can do during the Standstill Period**

During the Standstill Period, Ryan Cohen cannot:

- nominate or recommend for nomination any person for election at any annual or special meeting of the Company‚Äôs stockholders or otherwise seek representation on the Board

- submit, participate in or be the proponent of any proposal for consideration at, or bring any other business before, any annual or special meeting of the Company‚Äôs stockholders

627,Alright - the other guy did an intro to options. Here's an intro to spreads.,3176,m590bc,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m590bc/alright_the_other_guy_did_an_intro_to_options/,368,"# Updated with link to options intro and information at the bottom of the post

**I'm going to teach you guys about call/put spreads.**

In this guide, we'll use AMC as the example. Let's pretend it is currently trading at $9.28.

# First, some terms you should know:

Option: a contract that gives you the OPTION to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date

Premium: The per-share price paid to the option contract seller for the option

Underlying: The stock on which we are trading options

Long: Means that we are BUYING an option

Short: Means that we are SELLING an option

Call: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to BUY 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

Put: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to SELL 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

&#x200B;

Now, how can we make money with a small account balance?

# If we have a BULLISH outlook (AMC goes to $13 because Stonks go up üìàüìàüìà)

# 1. YOLO calls (maximum gains, maximum risk):

Buy an out-of-the-money (OTM) call for an expiration date and hope the gamble goes your way.

**A long $10C 3/26** ($10 dollar strike call expiring on March 26) position trades for a premium of $1.49 a share, which gives us a total price of $149 per contract (100 shares at $1.49 per share).

This contract is out of the money - meaning the strike price is above the current trading price.

This is a straight up gamble. If AMC doesn't reach the strike price, the option expires worthless, because buying 100 shares at market price will be cheaper than exercising your right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. In that scenario, we have lost the premium we spent to buy the option.

As $AMC‚Äôs market price approaches the strike price of $10, the option‚Äôs value will go up ‚Äì meaning you could sell the option at a higher premium than you paid for it.

However, we will still lose money on this trade if the price doesn‚Äôt go above $11.49. That can be calculated by adding our per-share premium to our strike price. Since we paid $1.49 per share for the contract at a $10 strike, we need to recoup the premium of $1.49 per share. Hence the breakeven stock price is $11.49.

If AMC manages to hit $13, we‚Äôll be able to exercise the option (and purchase 100 shares at 11.49 each) or sell the contract for the market rate of around $3.00 per share. If we exercise the option, we could immediately sell the 100 shares at market price of $13, earning us $13 - $11.49 = $1.51 per share, or $151 total.

**Net investment and max risk: $149 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $11.49 ($10 strike + $1.49 premium)**

**Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì $1.49) x 100**

&#x200B;

# 2. Debit spread (limited gains, lower risk)

This option strategy is a two-tiered approach. In short, we open both a long and a short position at different strike prices.

Let‚Äôs say we think AMC will go up to around $13 by 3/26.

We can **buy**, or **open a long $10c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.49 per share ($149 per contract). This is out of the money.

We then **sell** or **open a** **short $12c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.00 per share ($100 per contract). It‚Äôs also out of the money, but since we are selling it, we get the $100.

Net-net, we spend $49 per contract here, which significantly reduces our risk profile and makes our break-even price much lower. Now let‚Äôs see what happens:

**AMC @ 13**

If AMC hits $13, both of our options are in the money. The $10c will be worth 3.00/share, and the $12c will be worth $1/share, which means when we close the options, we collect $300 and pay $100, giving us a gross profit of $200. If we subtract our initial cost of $49, we get a net profit of **$151**. Important to note that our profits are capped at $151/contract since we only have a spread of $2 between the strike prices.

**AMC @ 11**

If AMC hits $11, only our long contract is in the money. The $10c will be worth $1.00/share, and the 12c will be worthless. This means we can close our options and pocket the difference, which is **$51.**

**Net investment and max risk: $49 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $10.49 ($10 strike + 0.49 net premium)**

**Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì 1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)**

**Net P/L at $10: +51 per contract ($1.00 ‚Äì 0.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)**

# If we have a BEARISH outlook (AMC goes to $6 because fuck AMC, all my homies hate AMC üìâüìâüìâ)

# 1. YOLO Puts (maximum gains, maximum risk)

A **long 8P 3/26** position trades for a premium of $1.05 per share, so $105 per contract.

Like the YOLO call, this is a gamble, and if you don‚Äôt have a lot of equity in your account, it‚Äôs unwise unless you have a really good feeling, or it came to you in a dream.

The same principle with breakeven prices applies here. Our 8p costs 1.05 a share, so for us to break even, the share price needs to reach $6.95 (8 ‚Äì 1.05). To exercise this option, we would buy 100 shares of $AMC at market price of $6.95, then sell those shares to the sucker on the other end of our option for $8 per share.

If the price doesn‚Äôt go below $8, our option expires worthless.

If the price hits $5.50, we can exercise the option: Buy 100 shares of AMC at current market price ($5.50) and then sell them for $8 a share (our strike price). Alternatively, we can sell the option for the market price, which would be around $2.50, netting us $1.45 per share.

**Net investment and max risk: $105 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $6.95 ($8 strike ‚Äì $1.05 premium)**

**Net P/L at $5.50: +145 per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì $1.05) x 100**

# 2. Another debit spread (limited gains, low risk)

Again, we use the same approach with spreads as before.

We can open the same **long 8p 3/26** position for 1.05/share, and simultaneously open a **short 6p 3/26** position for 0.33/share. That gives us a total cost of 0.72 per share, making our breakeven price 7.28 (8 - 0.72).

The spread is the maximum potential gain per share. So even if AMC tanks and goes below $3-4 a share, our maximum profit potential doesn‚Äôt change after it drops past 6.

Let‚Äôs see the math:

**AMC @ 5.50**

Both of our options are in the money. The 8p will be worth 2.50 per share, and 6p will be worth 0.50 a share. When we close the options, we collect $250 for selling the 8p, and pay $50 for closing the 6p, for gross earnings of $2.00 per share. If we subtract our buy-in of .72, we are left with 1.28 per share as our profit or **$128**.

**AMC @ 7.00**

Again, here only our long position is in the money. The 8P will be worth 1.00 per share, and the 6P is worthless. We can close the option out and pocket our difference of 0.28 per share, or **$28.**

**Net investment and max risk: $72 per contract**

**Breakeven price: $7.28 ($8 strike ‚Äì 0.72 net premium)**

**Net P/L at $5.50: +128 per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì 0.5) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)**

**Net P/L at $7.00: +28 per contract ($1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)**

# What if we have a NEUTRAL OUTLOOK?

We can still make money using a covered call, but we need a bit more capital to start.

First, we need to buy 100 shares of AMC at 9.28, which makes our cost basis (what we paid for it) $928.

If we think that the share price will trade mostly sideways, we can open a **short, covered call** position. This means we are selling the option for a buyer to purchase our 100 shares from us for a given price.

In our example, we open a **short 12C 3/26** position, which means we agree to sell 100 shares of AMC on 3/26 for $12 a share. The premium for this contract is $1.00 per share, so we pocket the $100. We keep this $100 no matter what, and we can use it to offset our cost basis. So regardless of what happens, our new cost basis for 100 shares of AMC is now $828.

Let‚Äôs see what happens on 3/26 when the contract expires:

**AMC @ 10**

The 12C contract expired worthless ‚Äì nobody is going to exercise a 12c when the market price is only $10.

Thus, our net gain is $**172.** We made 0.72 per share on each of our 100 shares as the price rose to $10, **and** we keep the $100 premium we were paid for selling the 12c.

**AMC @ 11.99**

The 12C contract still expired worthless. Our net gain is **$371** ‚Äì we made $2.71 on the share price rising and keep the $100 premium.

**AMC @ 14.50**

The 12C contract ended up in the money, which means that it will be exercised. Now, we sell our shares at $12 a share, earning $1,200. We also get keep the premium, so our total proceeds are $1,300. We do lose out on the potential unrealized gains we would have had if we were free to sell the shares on the market for $14.50.

Once the contract expires, we are free to do what we want with the shares: sell them for a profit or sell another covered call.

**Link to original** [post on options](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/)

**A word of caution on debit spreads: PIN RISK**

Let's run through our debit put spread example again.

On 3PM Friday 3/26, AMC is around 9.00/share. Both the 8P you bought and the 6P you sold are worthless. However, what you don't know is that contracts can be exercised until around 5:30 EST on the day of expiry.

So - if AMC closes at 8.90, and then crashes to $5 around 5PM, both of your options are ITM. Now, the buyer of your short position will exercise their option, meaning they will sell you 100 shares at $6 a share. If you aren't paying attention or your broker sucks, your long position, which should cover it, will expire.

Now you're on the hook to hold up your obligation, and you've lost the leverage you had beforehand.

There is really only one way to prevent this. **Close your spreads before 3PM on Friday of expiration.** You might lose out on some of the last-minute moves, but consider it an insurance payment. Otherwise, you might check your broker on Saturday to see your account blown up.",2021-03-15 04:01:34

One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that ‚Äúthe number of recent conversations \[on Reddit\] including both GME and stimulus is low.‚Äù

As some of you know, I‚Äôve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.

I'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the ""stimmy effect"" recently.

To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:

[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)

Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:

[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)

The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:

[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)

From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.

|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|
|:-|:-|
|3/15/21|124|
|3/14/21|103|
|3/16/21|74|
|3/13/21|69|
|1/14/21|67|

To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.

[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\/ \\""stimmy ratio\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)

I don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.

Elliot Wave Theory

&#x200B;

Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

As you can see, our fellow ü¶ç Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064

Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf

Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. ü§Ø I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

So you are telling me that fellow ü¶ç Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first üöÄ launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb

Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January 

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our üöÄ finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec

What actually happened after that ""prediction""?

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our üöÄ take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f

Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b

üöÄ Pre-Launch

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few üìÑ üôå bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our üöÄ fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the üöÄ take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",2021-03-17 04:16:16

So let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.

I intend to keep holding them. But when you call people bitches or pussies for taking a profit, you are giving ammunition for anyone to call WSB a plump and dumpling (actual words forbidden) forum, because those tactics are what plump and dumplingers use so they can exit confidently at the highest price. You're also feeding the narrative that WSB is acting as a single entity because you're deliberately trying to coerce someone into taking a particular action by verbally harassing them.

So here's my advice: if you *are* trying to P&D our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a üßªü§≤.

See you on the moon friends. Please be respectful.

EDIT: my title is not specific enough. Someone pointed out in the comments that there's always been bullying on WSB - people bullied DFV. This is part of WSB's blood and really I don't have a problem with it. What I specifically take issue with is using insults to coerce people into not selling *to increase your own profits.* I get that you're not trying to take profits at the bullied person's expense, but to someone from the outside, that distinction isn't obvious. And it very well may end up being at the other person's expense depending on how this all shakes out. Let's not pretend we're not taking risks here.

>In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze????

They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX, but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME.

Looking at this graph, the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19

and with it the gamma amplification affect. With the 3/12 gone, that's almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there's still a chance for gamma.

I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don't know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.

https://preview.redd.it/3rut9av74qm61.jpg?width=685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64f835a0daa0f4f1236f9b5302458a4b2ae21afc

The graph shows that hedgies think ü¶çü¶çü¶ç attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.

Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY, she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\

According to her : ""blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it's trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. **so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is <50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts""**

I can't comment on the business transformation, I'm not an e-commerce expert, I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take \~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.

With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around \~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that's about 40,000 ü¶çü¶çü¶ç each with 1k üçåüçåüçå)

# TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,ü¶çü¶çü¶ç together strong, YOLO-ers ü¶çü¶çü¶ç buying 800C not helping.

Buying 1 Contract of 270C 3/12 on Friday afternoon 3/5  or Monday morning 3/8, at the price of 3-5USD per contract(100 shares) / $ 300 with **6x initial delta amplification** would have resulted in **42x amplification**  value of shares delta hedged by MMs in Thursday or Friday open of about $13,000.

670,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,2757,m5wglc,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wglc/gme_trading_strategy_to_catalyze_the_squeeze/,281,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I‚Äôm an Old  Ape. I‚Äôm an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I‚Äôm an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I‚Äôm an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn‚Äôt fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.

&#x200B;

I used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.

&#x200B;

The Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)

.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can‚Äôt account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.

There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you‚Äôre reading this btw)

On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.

So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That‚Äôs a lot of bananas. Like a lot.  


 **(( EDIT: $99,965,839 spent on these options. // Shorts/Hedge removed is 116,463,553 ))**  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That‚Äôs quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.  


**(( EDIT: -16,497,714 with adjustments to formula  still not sure how to account for IV / Vega / Theta in all of this))**

&#x200B;

Other information I like:65.2 million outstanding sharesshort float is 54.16 million cccording to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),short interest according to Morningstar is 52% . (**EDIT: updated to 26.22%)**

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**(( EDIT: -22,474,752 total shares to be covered after adjusting SI -))**

**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.

Go long, and stay strong

\*\*Positions:\*\*Was holding 365 shares, told wife i'd withdraw more money this weekend because she's sketched out as fuck about all of this (bigly bananas up for the year), down to 265 shares now.  with $30k in bananas to continue to add

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

>In     order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the     restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified     fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.      Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold     securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for     a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

684,GME Bloomberg Terminal Update 03/18/21 | THE ENDGAME IS NEAR,2590,m7yw5z,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7yw5z/gme_bloomberg_terminal_update_031821_the_endgame/,289,"WELCOME FELLOW APES TO MY LAST BLOOMBERG UPDATE ON 03/18/21 !

I hope you're all doing great and have popcorn nearby for tomorrow.

Like last time, I am going to explain you what you can see on the different pictures step by step, or picture by picture in this case.



PICTURE 1:

https://preview.redd.it/wgfpkk1s4tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf17c0c0a7c6164dbd996fadbb783719340a079

In the first picture, we don't really see a difference compared to my last screenshots. We see a decline in sellers, which is obviously good, and a small increase of institutional involvement, also good. No negative data.



PICTURE 2:

https://preview.redd.it/hzvspcs66tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed4244b5cd2bcc90c1140300a0a0b9de9d3ac0ef

I find it quite funny, that we can see a spanish asset manager buying call options which also expire tomorrow. Just like the idea, that some of the hedgies want other hedgies to be smashed. They don't really have a huge position and won't have any big impact on the price of GME. All other options you can see are outdated and the accuracy of these options cannot be granted. Don't try to speculate, since you cannot tell whether they're still in or not.

For all of you who don't know what call options are, the spanish asset manager bets that the price of GME will be above 200$ tomorrow, which would definitely be amazing for us apes. I am explaining in the following pictures why exactly.



PICTURE 3:

https://preview.redd.it/opnh5k177tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bede88f52d218976b6f0cff114ba4ce8fa52d1b1

Okay so, this is where the important stuff is displayed. We can see that 11,681 options are expiring tomorrow if the price hits 250$, which is currently not the case. (GME at 211$ while I'm writing this DD). This would mean at this point over 2509 call options COULD, not have to, execute tomorrow ~ 250k shares COULD be bought. Keep in mind, that most people don't execute their calls, but rather just sell them.

Important info: I am only taking into account call options from 160$ - 250$ as you can see, since I didnt want to add all the amounts from 100$ to idk where. So you can expect that there are at least over 1000 options expiring aswell at the strike price of 100$. But I know some would argue about this, and this is why I am just calculating with the options shown in the screenshot.



SO: If GME hits 250$ by tomorrow over 1,2 mio shares COULD be bought, assuming that all people execute the calls, but this doesn't really has a huge importance since marketmakers begin to buy shares already in case of someone executes his options. 1,2 mio shares being bought at the same point, or even half of it -> huge price jump. But also 100k or 200k shares would create a price jump and therefore COULD lead to the so-called gamma squeeze (hitting higher stock prices, causing other options to be in the money, and so on). I don't say that it for sure will cause a gamma squeeze. It just could end up in the situation we're all striving for.



PICTURE 4:

https://preview.redd.it/t7m7flh59tn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f98da6a0969261cbe0dc220bc4a1ef24ffb4b21b

Okay so, now we come to the point where you can clearly see why it's kind of important for GME to be over 200$ by tomorrow. If GME is UNDER 200$ TOMORROW, over 12k put options (1,2 mio shares) CAN be executed, which would cause a price drop. That doesn't automatically mean that the gamma squeeze possibility is non-existent anymore, but it would definitely mean that we would have to wait for the next expiration date to let it happen. It also doesn't mean that everyone really executes his options, since like I said, most of them never get executed.



Now we come to the huge BUT part:

IF GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW, WE HAVE NEARLY NO PUT OPTIONS THAT ARE OF ANY IMPORTANCE ANYMORE. This means, that there would really be no huge downward pressure on the price, outgoing from options, if it starts to rise. You can check this by yourself on other platforms. There are not a lot put calls on GME over the strike price of 200$.





Picture 5:

https://preview.redd.it/ofxur2biatn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=681866a6b46249f775ac5ddefd2c900cb4135d64

This is again very interesting imo, since we can clearly see, that the ETF objectives increased their positions by over 10%. OVER 10% !!! Since Blackrock owns almost 10mio shares which are mostly in ETFs (I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN BLOOMBERG RESEARCH BUT YOU CAN OFC JUST DONT TRUST ME. THEN IGNORE THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE) , I ASSUME that BLACKROCK (LARGEST ASSET MANAGER IN THE WORLD) is on our side and wants GME to skyrocket. Very good information, so do I think. We also see an overall increase in positions, except from one fund objective, the value fund objective (betting on stocks that are in their opinion undervalued). I know there were a lot of posts about Blackrock being on Citadels site. Which is just as likely. I don't have more information than you have. But Blackrock is the biggest shareholder of GME and has most of its stocks in ETFS.

The ETF increase could also just mean that another Hedgefund, not called Blackrock, increased their position in ETFs. Everything is possible.



Last picture:

https://preview.redd.it/7mlji2q9btn61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=947b90a1993cf426da98ee679e8732a10dfd82e7

This really contains no helpful information, but I just want to show you that all short sellers stopped reporting short interest since the 02/26/2021 (When GME started to rise from 40$ on february 22nd to 265$ on march 10th.). Although short interest usually got reported on the 15th each month, we still have no recent reports. Seems a bit sketchy, imo. But this could also just mean nothing.



I don't want to get anybody buy GME due to my posts, since I am mostly making assumptions here and personally just find it really suspicious. I know we all find the situation really suspicious.



I THANK EVERYBODY FOR READING THIS AND WHICH ALL OF US GOOD LUCK IN THE WAR! I AM HYPED FOR POWER HOUR AND IF GME IS ABLE TO STAY ABOVE 200$. but keep in mind, we have many evidences, that other HFs are on our side, besides from my assumptions that Blackrock wants GME to skyrocket. Please read other DD's if you want to have more info about this topic particularly. I can recommend DD's by u/HeyItsPixel about this topic.



HAVE A NICE EVENING EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU ALL.



PS: Holy shit this really took me an hour to make.



EDIT: GME DOES NOT HAVE TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW! THIS ALSO DOESNT MEAN THAT ""GME IS OVER"" OR SOME SH** IF IT CLOSES UNDER 200. I WILL HOLD MY SHARES UNTIL GME HITS 1 MIL. I DONT CARE IF IT IS TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR. PLEASE DONT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I SAID THAT GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE A SPECIFIC RANGE**. I WANTED TO SAY THE GAMMA SQUEEZE IS MOST LIKELY TO EXPECT TOMORROW OR MONDAY WHEN GME IS ABOVE 200$ TOMORROW SINCE MOST OPTIONS EXPIRE ON MARCH 19th which is information we already had a long time ago. I held my shares while being at -90% and I will hold them until they're at +69,420%. My personal opinion.**

EDIT 2 : My main goal is not to motivate you, promise you anything or predict anything. My intention of my every two-day Bloomberg updates are to show you how the market does and if retail is selling or anything. That‚Äôs all. If you‚Äôre not interested in my text, don‚Äôt read it and just look at the screenshots and make your own opinions. I know, that not all options have to be executed and most of them probably are not being executed.

EDIT 3: I also did not say that Blackrock IS FOR SURE ON OUR SIDE, but Blackrock is the one having most shares embedded in ETFs. And as you can see, the positions in ETFs increased by 10%. This also COULD MEAN THAT ANOTHER HEDGEFUND OR ASSET MANAGER JUST INCREASED THEIR POSITION!! Don't get me wrong, PLEASE!

For real, it just makes me sad that so many people misunderstand me and think ""I am one of them"", ""trying to say that GME HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE 200$ tomorrow or it crashes"" or say that I said ""all options are for sure being exectued"". I never said such things and that was never my intention. I am not going to make any more updates.

TL;DR:

IF GME ABOVE 200$ PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF. IF UNDER: GET YOUR MONEY TOGETHER CUZ ITS A FIRE SALE

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

Here's the tweet they sent out: [Forbes on Twitter: ""Losing Touch With Reality ‚Äì A GameStop Lesson https://t.co/msQlQleVqI"" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1370993131592814601)

EDITED TO REMOVE POSITIONSüõë

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

These are just a few. There are more.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. üöÄ

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 


We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

There are a few points to touch on, but essentially my thesis is based on [today's chart so far](https://imgur.com/gallery/fLe50gq) and a couple of key points.

#Today's Chart & Price Action

When market opened today, almost all technical indicators were very bullish for GME. This indicates that we should see some very strong bullish moves in price today.

A quick caveat - all technical analysis, and any natural price movement really, requires volume. Without volume, the price cannot move naturally, and technical analysis/indicators will eventually exhaust and fail.

Looking at the chart today, the price action was playing out somewhat as expected. It tested an early support around $210-211 before entering a rising channel for most of the morning. Indicators remained bullish for the entire time, but volume wasn't showing up. After two down days, this was a perfect opportunity to create a massive move and gap up - potentially causing a small squeeze. But nothing happened. Volume never showed up, and the move started to become exhausted.

At about 1PM, we started seeing the price test the lower end of the channel repeatedly. At this point, if we were going to see a bullish continuence, we would see a spike in volume to push it back up into the channel. We repeatedly didn't see this and it eventually failed. And then what happened? **Nothing.**

This failure to maintain the bullish move was a perfect opportunity for those holding short positions to pounce. They could have used a fairly minimal amount of capital to smack the price down, and likey blow right past this morning's support of $210 and maybe even break below $200. It was a golden opportunity, and literally nothing happened. Even now, at almost 2PM it is still trading sideways on virtually no volume.

Both sides of this trade, long and short, were presented with golden opportunities throughout this morning. Both sides chose not to act. Why?

#Gamma Squeezes

In order to continue, and explain my thesis, I need to explain a bit about gamma squeezes. **I also think this will be helpful to many people, because there is a ton of misconception that spreads about how gamma squeezes work.**

Gamma squeezes are a result of open interest in options and hedging by the market makers holding the options. People also misinterpret volume as open interest. Volume on options is for the most part irrelevant. What matters is how many total calls are open at each strike price. When a market makers sells a call option, they must remain risk neutral. In order to do so they need to buy shares of the underlying stock as the call becomes more likely to expire in the money. In a very simplistic form: let's say there is currently a 50% chance a 230c ends up in the money at the end of the week. The market maker would buy 50 shares now to hedge their risk. As it becomes more or less likely through price movement and theta decay, they'll either sell or buy more shares to remain risk neutral.

This leads us to the most common misinformation I see spread here and other places regarding gamma squeezes. *There are currently 250,000 calls ITM, so if we hold above this by Friday there will be a gamma squeeze.* That is not how it works. The strike prices that are currently in the money are probably considered 90+% likely to be in the money upon expiration, which means they are pretty much fully hedged already. They do not remain naked on all calls and then scrambled at close on Friday to fulfill ITM contracts.

So what causes a gamma squeeze? (This part is very important, and is the key to my entire thesis for Friday)

A large amount of open interest becoming ITM suddenly, unexpectedly, and very close to expiration. A gamma squeeze is essentially market makers scrambling to accumulate shares to fulfill contracts that are in the money. The only scenario in which this happens is for very unexpected price movement to happen on Friday basically.

#My Thesis

Short positions do not want the price to drop between now and market open on Friday. Longs want to have the highest possible number of OTM call options when markets open on Friday. Why? We need a large amount of open interest to move from OTM to ITM suddenly, unexpectedly and close to expiration so there is a smaller window for MM to fulfill the shares.

If we can get down under $150 by Friday open, this gives us several strike prices in $10 increments, many of which have large open interest amounts. These strike prices can be used fairly rapidly to force unexpected need for hedging risk (aka buying shares) very quickly. If we end up opening at $250+ on Friday? Most open interest that can realistically end ITM will already be ITM and thus already fully hedged against. This means there is little to no opportunity to force a gamma squeeze. Not only does open interest go against us, but we'd need to move the price up $50 to hit the next large batch of open interest, and then another $50 to the next, then after $400 it goes in $100 increments. *Additionally*, it takes an exorbitant amount of money to move the price from $250-300. It takes MUCH less to move it from $150-160. Then $160-170. And so on. And along the way you're picking up more and more buying pressure from MM hedging.

An added bonus to keeping the price lower is it will increase the open interest in FDs by lowering the premiums at strike prices between 150-250ish, which is where we really need the most open interest. 

#Conclusion

Short positions desperately do not want the price to drop too much before Friday. The squeeze needs an explosive movement to trigger, and if we get down to around $150-160 before open on Friday, it will take a significantly lower amount of capital and volume to trigger a large move.

Long positions want to see as low of a base as possible going into Friday, because it will mean a larger amount of open interest that can be used as fuel for a gamma squeeze, which could trigger the short squeeze.

IMPORTANT: This is all my opinion. This also is not a guarantee. For starters, I could be wrong about literally everything - I am retarded after all. Secondly, long whales have planned big attacks on Fridays before and failed every time. They could fail again this week even if I'm right. The important part is that if you believe based on your research that the short interest is still over 100%, then this has to squeeze at some point. It doesn't have to happen Friday, but it does have to happen. At the end of the day, validate any DD you see on your own, do your own research, and make your own decisions.

This time with pretty shapes!",2421,m9fq7w,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9fq7w/gme_potential_pattern_descending_triangle_to_cup/,459,"Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  üåàüêª  thesis included.

First, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441

Second, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ¬Ω. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Maybe one day?**

Okay now let‚Äôs look at just the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea

So we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.

Looking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.

Knowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.

The only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.

Evidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.

Potential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during ‚ÄúU‚Äù formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19. I have not analyzed it much yet, but it was pointed out to me by another redditor.

Edit: Added one more potential reasons cup with handle might fail.

Edit2: Removed links.

Edit3: My bad yall! As pointed out in comments, not descending triangle as that is a continuation pattern not a reversal pattern. Changing it to say ""downward trendlines"" instead, cant change the title unfortunately LOL what can i say im retarded

Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. 

I want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. 

But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. 

So when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a support and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!

Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. 

Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be soon! 

As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! 

TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon. I like the stock and you should like it too.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out we shouldn't put dates on our analysis and I must say I agree. Although I see a very good chance of upward movement soon, we shouldn't link this to today or Monday.

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|
|10|5|7.3m shares|
|10|10|14.6m shares|

&#x200B;

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

I know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.

Edit: /u/alice_oe made this data point ‚ÄúI use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.‚Äù

Instead of trying to push the price down, which coagulates more people in the battle (and eventually attracts even more retail investors), they could momentarily try to control the rise to 300-500$, so to give the (false) impression that the peak has been reached.

Transforming lots of people's hands in paper (EDIT 2: especially if the price then is pushed down quickly)?

It would be risky and probably cost millions, but it would also save TRILLIONS and - in the process of going up - the HFs will find a way to make money in any case.

Thoughts?

**EDIT 1** \--> **TL:DR** ""I will convince myself that the HFs have STARTED to lose control only when the stock will be above 10K.""

**EDIT 2** \--> ""Market Maker ‚ÄúA‚Äù with the FTD can work in collaboration with Market Maker ‚ÄúB‚Äù. ‚ÄúA‚Äù locates and borrows shares from ‚ÄúB‚Äù. However, ‚ÄúB‚Äù uses a naked short to supply the borrowed stock.

* If ‚ÄúB‚Äù does not find and locate, they have an FTD. ‚ÄúB‚Äù then can buy the shares from Market Maker ‚ÄúC‚Äù who executes a naked short, ad infinitum.

This is called rolling over a position and can be done for a very long time. Obviously, it requires a conspiracy between Market Maker ‚ÄúA‚Äù, Market Maker ‚ÄúB‚Äù etc.

This is in direct reference to the DD that gained some traction here earlier today. The volume for GME is low, but this does not show in any way that supply is low. In fact, there's no possible way to deduce that from graphs like these. You could draw the conclusion that the high price is leading to low volume, but not much more than that.

GameStop.com
4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. 

That‚Äôs before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there‚Äôs no such thing as BAD press. 
(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) 

I ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you‚Äôre sooooooooo fucked!!!!!

If you use normal website sale conversations it‚Äôs usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you‚Äôre looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven‚Äôt figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let‚Äôs say that visitor rate increases 3x that‚Äôs 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can‚Äôt you?

So down a shot of hedgie tears and be entertained by my weird thought process. 

For decades the avid retail investor has looked to an authority for trading advice, whether it be the News or a ‚Äòfinancial advisor‚Äô. They took shelter under their DD thinking they knew what they were talking about only to end up in the red or make a 5% gain which they called a win.

But in recent years as social media rose to be king there has been a shift in who investors have deemed the authority. News lost its audience and they started taking sides offering airtime to greedy folk who saw an opportunity to trick investors into thinking they were there for the little guy. \[Be careful of rich celebs who take our sides as they could be playing both sides\]

Why am I bringing this up? Well look around, here we are on a subreddit reading DD by anonymous investors and taking their word over those we can see on the television.

What does that tell me? The avid retail investor has little to no trust the MSM are talking in their best interests. They‚Äôve taken on their authoritarian position and assumed they were the Gods of stocks and could move money better than the hedgies could. How wrong they were.

They‚Äôve come to the realisation they are losing and now out to make an example of those pesky retail investors who ignored their calls to sell but instead bought the dip and/or held. They want them to lose so bad to prove they were just gamblers who are trying to manipulate the market. \[Total bullshit - we like the stock\]

I won‚Äôt go into detail here cause we‚Äôve seen it being plastered all over the subreddits. - The MSM lying.

So where am I going with this? 

People today are the new model of stock trading, the behaviours are not the same as boomers. They hold when told to sell \[by the MSM\]. The DD is comprehensive and detailed beyond basic understanding. Reasons are explained and any stock boomer lingo like shorting, buying calls or puts is explained for any simple ape to understand. So not only is the average retail investor learning how the market works at a rapid pace but now knows what signs to look for when they‚Äôre looking into a stock. 

GME has taught many how to react when the market is rigged. The talk of Diamond hands has not only been taught but is now in the process of forming how the retail investor behaves in a declining market when the boomers would paper hand and cut their loses. 

We‚Äôre entering a new era where retail investors are far more educated, the stock market lingo is broken to simple explanations making it easier for new investors to get up to speed. We find humour in an otherwise boring world filled with green, red and numbers. Not only is the retail market growing but it‚Äôll become the strongest backbone. When red comes there won‚Äôt be big sell orders. They‚Äôll simply buy the dip and ride it out. The money made won‚Äôt be out of greed, it‚Äôs made out of the want for a better more comfortable life. The taxes will \[hopefully\] go towards improving their society and fuel the economy for decades to come.

Change is coming and it‚Äôs for the good. 

TLDR: Hedgies and the MSM are going to lose to a bunch of retail investors called apes who can just about read, eat bananas and snort crayons for entertainment and can‚Äôt find the sell button.",2021-03-11 13:52:10

&#x200B;

*""Wow, great fucking observation!""* \- you

&#x200B;

# The reason this is worth noting is because of the difference in price on the day of frog ice cream tweet vs. today.

&#x200B;

**2/24/2021** | RC tweeted frog ice cream: Low of $45, RSI of 46

**3/24/2021** | Day after 2020 Q4 earnings: Low of \~$125 (at time of writing), RSI of 43

The day of RC's tweet and following day had a cumulative volume of \~233m shares and the price increased from a low of $45 to a high of $185, closing at $109.

&#x200B;

# Okay, what's a smooth brain to do with this type of data?

&#x200B;

**The answer:** Make a wild guesstimate about potential future price movement.

# 

# A crude calculation:

Today's low ($125) \* Two day price increase after RC's frog ice cream tweet (400%) = **$500**

Well I'll be damned. Isn't that a nice looking number?

With the current fundamental outlook and turnaround story that is unfolding before our eyes, my belief is that there is high potential for additional catalysts coming in the next year, months, weeks, or even days. I'd venture to say it can be a catalyst that triggers even more buying volume than frog ice cream. The timing is what we can't know.

&#x200B;

# What's my conclusion?

My calculation is crude and theoretical. The price could go back to $10 for all I know. But Jeffries just raised the PT to $175. There are a ton of potential catalysts coming, and GME RSI is in oversold territory. **I heard from someone with a wrinkle that low RSI = good time to buy.**

I get it, ending the day in the red sucks. It can also take an emotional toll if you allow. But there is something about GME pricing that I've seen a few people mention but not go into depth explaining. And it's pretty freaking important to understand:

First: **The value of currency, goods, or services is only worth the value YOU place upon it.** If that's not ape enough for you: banana worth whatever ape want.

Repeat the above a few times and let it sink in. This is not an oversimplification, it's a fundamental of economics.

Everyone is conditioned from the time they are a baby ape to trust what they are told something costs. Ever since you got your first allowance (if you were lucky) so you could ""learn the value of money"" you've been conditioned to think a good or service is worth what other people tell you.

Think about it: You go to the store to buy a pack of gum ""That'll be $1"", and you say ""Okay, if you say so"". Or as an ape, you go to the store to buy a banana ""That'll be $1"", and you grunt ""Banana good"". Rinse and repeat for the majority of things apes buy without question.

Over time, apes will start assigning intrinsic value to currency based on the pricing they see over and over for goods and services. This is why uncool boomers complain all the time about how a soda cost 5 cents back in their day. People become conditioned to expect X costs $Y.

### That's deep, but what does this have to do with stocks?

As some wrinkly brained apes get smarter, they may not take everything at face value and instead shop around for sellers with a better deal on that Banana. Basically, finding someone who assigned the same value to the good or service as them. When and if that occurs, they are both happy and willing to conduct the trade. It goes both ways, if you have a banana to sell you want to find the ape willing to pay the most. In the most simple sense, this is ""tHE MaRkET"".

Buyers and sellers are continuously trying to find each other in the market. But driving around in apemobiles across the country to find the perfect match is a pain in the ass. This is where marketplaces come into the picture.

A marketplace is a venue (physical or virtual) that serves to connect buyers with sellers. It's a great racket to be in, as those who operate the marketplace typically take a cut of every trade. Sound familiar? eBay? Amazon? NYSE? Because for most apes, it's worth not driving around to find the best price on 1 banana.

### I already know what is a marketplace!

Maybe so, but let me connect the dots.

The purpose of the marketplace is to match apes __willing__ to trade at the __same price__. In stock market terms this is ""bid"" and ""ask"" prices. So if one ape is willing to buy a banana for $1, and another ape is willing to sell a banana for $1, and that's the best price for both, a marketplace like NYSE matches them up automatically to conduct the trade.

Let's take a theoretical case of a stock that has only 1 share, 1 buyer, and 1 seller. If the buyer enters a limit order of $100, and the seller enters a limit order of $200 - no trade will occur. Those orders will just sit there and do nothing. In stock market terms this is trade volume, and in this case it's a big fat zero every minute of trading hours.

What if both apes had set their limit buy/sell orders for $150? The marketplace (NYSE) sees ""Hey, these two apes agree on a price, let me just conduct that trade for you."" This happens in a split second given computers are continuously looking at the backlog of buyers and sellers waiting to match. This backlog is also known as Market Depth, or Level 2 trading information.

(Bonus brain wrinkle: If either ape had set a market order instead of a limit order, the NYSE would automatically conduct trade at whatever price the other ape set. This is why market orders are probably not what most apes want to do. You never know who else might show up with a price you don't agree with.)

### Come on already, what is your point?

Now that everyone reading this should have the same understanding of the marketplace (NYSE) at this point, let's discuss how volume has an impact.

In the example above I use 1 buyer and 1 seller. Once their trade executed, it was a volume of one. If both buyer and seller had their limits set to $150, the NYSE would reflect a stock price of $150. Simple enough, right?

But what if there were 10 *potential* sellers with a share, 9 of which are diamond-handed apes, but 1 of those was a hedgehog and wanted to drive down price? We already know the 9 apes value their shares at $1M and are not __willing__ to sell for the __same price__ that the buyer is bidding ($150). Let‚Äôs say the NYSE shows the last trade price as $420k. All it takes is for that one hedgehog to put in a sell order for $150 and BAM! NYSE then shows the last trade price as $150, not the $1M that the 9 other apes value the stock to be. This is because NYSE did what is supposed to do and match a buyer and a seller that agreed on the same price. 

""Preposterous! Market manipulation!"" the apes scream, as they start throwing shit around their cages. Unfortunately as a result, 1 of those apes may become paper hands after their primitive visual cortex lights up seeing $150 on NYSE and triggers a prehistoric behavior that says ""banana worth what other ape tell me it worth"" and starts mashing the sell button.

Well good job you stupid ape. You let 1 hedgehog tell you what you think your share is worth, and therefore made it a reality. Ignoring the 9 other apes that think it's worth $1M. You‚Äôve been conditioned your whole life to let a sticker price tell you what something is worth and haven‚Äôt evolved. Pathetic.

### So the last trade price on NYSE isn't really what the stock is worth?

No. Whether it be 10 apes or 10 million apes, NYSE is not going to reflect what the other apes value the shares to be. The last trade price is exactly that, the __last trade__. This is why trade volume is so important, anything less than 1M volume can easily affect the last trade price. But that's not the value of the shares! Repeat with me: ""The last trade price is not the value of the shares!""

### TLDR;

* The HFs know that apes are conditioned to think money has value.
* Share prices don‚Äôt reflect what people think it‚Äôs worth, they only reflect the __last trade__.
* The HFs also know they can easily manipulate the __last trade__ price on low volume.
* The HFs are screwed as long as apes don't let NYSE ticker tell them what they should value the shares to be.

# TL;DR

Think like a customer. Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.

Walk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?

When you‚Äôve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.

# Purpose

Disclaimer: Don‚Äôt use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**
* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# First Phase: Real Estate

Walk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?

https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8

Ultimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf

The reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.

&#x200B;

# Second Phase: Customer Service

You as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey‚Äôs targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.

https://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6

Ask yourself:

\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?

\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?

\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?

‚Äì Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?

\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?

\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?

&#x200B;

# Summary

Despite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù in customer.

772,Why closing at $14 and $200 DOES NOT MATTER- let‚Äôs do this again,2006,m8rx62,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8rx62/why_closing_at_14_and_200_does_not_matter_lets_do/,323,"**why closing at $14 and $200  DOES NOT MATTER** Facts not FUD

I see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) 

**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That‚Äôs NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner

This is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you‚Äôre watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. 

On to the options component of our class - 

Obviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I‚Äôm going to try a practical approach.

Use the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went ‚Äúoh well looks like I‚Äôm short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.‚Äù

OF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúgamma squeeze.‚Äù

As people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!

There‚Äôs all sorts of slightly technical reasons there‚Äôs small overhangs at 4:00 but it‚Äôs mostly done. 

Second practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear ‚Äúif the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren‚Äôt the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don‚Äôt you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?

Options markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what‚Äôs happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There‚Äôs slightly more to it (you can look up ‚Äúpin risk‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax pain‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôm trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.",2021-03-20 00:44:36

I didn‚Äôt put in a lot, I did what I was willing to lose. I rode from $330 down to $45... I averaged down a few times, to have 50 now.

You didn't even read any articles, you saw a bunch of posts ""fuck Michael Jordan"", you googled around and found your confirmation bias. Michael Jordan personally shorted GME!

TL DR: You didn't check the sources. Well, too bad, because the whole story is fake news. They are just looking for clicks and Gamestop generates clicks. Michael Jordan is a celebrity, like Kim Kardashian. That's enough. Even heard about Beyonce's divorce?

Let's review the facts. Quote from one of the articles:

*""Michael Jordan sold a stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2019 to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim"".* 

That's it for the facts. Plotkin name. Plotkin gave Jordan some money in exchange for a stake in a sports team TWO YEARS AGO. Jordan probably doesn't even remember his face by now. Oh, and Jordan lost some money, no one knows the details because why would they know?

Is it enough to spin a story around it? No. But we'll do it anyway by implying it indirectly and by making speculative bullshit connections and by misleading headlines, like we've done every day with Beyonce's divorce for over a decade now.

>HEADLINE: *Michael Jordan Is Directly Connected to the GameStop Trading War and Has Been Bleeding Money for the Last Year* 

Text of the article two scrolls lower: *While Michael Jordan himself didn‚Äôt lose any money during the GameStop trade war (that we know of anyway).*

This is a VALUE stock and you bought it at a huge discount.  

\*Earnings per share estimate was $1.35, the actual was $1.34 - they met expectations.

\*Q4 online sales were up 175% for the quarter, and 191% for the year.  They have already started the pivot to e-commerce.

\*They paid $57 million in debt and still had $635m in cash.

\*They cut operating expenses by 18% in Q4, and 21% for the fiscal year.

But the real value of this stock comes from its future, not its past performance.  If they were killing it, you wouldn't get it at a discount.  You make money by being ahead of Wall Street, and right now Wall Street focuses on old measurements and mature companies.  You only hit it big if you can see what most people can't, or won't see.  Go watch DFV videos on YouTube from last July.

Ryan Cohen is a freaking genius.  Anyone that can take on Amazon and win is a really good bet in my opinion.  He invested

Hired Josh Krueger on 3/1/2021 to oversee GME's e-commerce fulfillment.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon

Neda Pacifico was named as Senior Vice President of E-commerce today.  Guess where she came from?  Chewy.  
Hired Matt Francis as first-ever Chief Technology Officer today.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon

I'll admit, it sucked to see the price drop after-hours below my cost.   Let's just say I have a material portion of my net worth in GME.  But ultimately, you either believe in the company or not.  I have 35 years of accounting and executive mgmt - I've studied up on this company.  Considering the success and expertise of the people driving the GME rocket, I'm all in and I'm not folding.  

The gaming industry is bigger than movies and all North American sports - COMBINED, and these are committed customers trust me.  It's like asking an addict if they plan to buy drugs this year.  Duh, they are going to buy more.

When you think about what is on the line for these hedge funds, did you really think they were just going to fold?  Those bastards only win if you quit.  Hold the stock because it's a really good investment, not because it's a short-squeeze opportunity, though that's some nice icing on the top.  Patience, nothing good ever comes easy.

I‚Äôve just started denting my brain by understanding how Fails to Deliver are hid in Out of the Money calls or puts or whatever and now I got to try and understand Payment for Order Flow?! Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?!

So, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn‚Äôt move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, ‚Äòoh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one‚Äô? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven‚Äôt been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier?

Its starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole?

This is my favorite part of his Wiki.

""Madoff founded a¬†penny stock¬†brokerage¬†in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\[6\]\[7\]¬†The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\[8\]¬†which bypassed ""specialist"" firms by directly executing orders¬†over the counter¬†from retail brokers."" FUCKING GREAT!!!

Then I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard\* who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I‚Äôve been so patiently waiting on.

Any talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time...

I remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF‚Äôs and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don‚Äôt think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven‚Äôt had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF‚Äôs, hidden FTD‚Äôs etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short‚Äôs. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus!

I‚Äôm so angry and frustrated and I don‚Äôt know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I‚Äôm just a homeless filmmaker, aren‚Äôt real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What‚Äôs next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!!

This really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn‚Äôt it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street!

Is every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, ‚Äòhey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff‚Äô.

FUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don‚Äôt know who to trust!

I‚Äôm angry, scared, exhilarated‚Ä¶ Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G‚Äôs into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I‚Äôm doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride!

I‚Äôm so confused and don‚Äôt know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL!

TL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme.

Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.

There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).

They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.

This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.

What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.

[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.

If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

&#x200B;

So now that they have tipped their hand that they will try try scare everyone into a Bank Run here are the KEY psychological targets they may drop shares at this week. DO NOT PANIC!

**Important price 1: $250**If they can 'break' the positive momentum and get the price below $250 that may signal a bank run and collapse the price. They may try this at open on Monday.

**Important price 2: $300**They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350.

&#x200B;

**Important price 3: $340.20**This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Important price 4: $350**Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400.

**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.

**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.

\*\*TLDR:\*\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want. Be prepared for the psychological games they will play. Remember NO SANE INVESTOR dumps shares at a loss or less of a profit...

Have a GREAT weekend!

**TLDR UPDATE: FAWCK I FORGOT ABOUT $420.69! LOTS OF IDIOTS WILL SELL HERE TOO**

https://preview.redd.it/acopf56dr9m61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=921fe515d9d1fe8b49c7fc0ff410a016c0b3d5d6

Lets see the results...

https://preview.redd.it/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4

The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**

We have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.

**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**

We established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.

If a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**

***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***

**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse

This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiet237zcum61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.

EDIT: I also wanted to add that though GME's rising price action could be considered ""crazy,"" it's market cap is honestly not crazy. People usually get caught up in the price but don't look at the actual market cap. GME's current marketcap is only about 18B. Is that overvalued for where the company sits at this current moment? YES. But, if GME makes a shift to the digital space and becomes the go-to for literally everything relating to gaming (and possibly gambling), then a 100 billion dollar market cap is very reasonable. This is why DFV likes the stock. I think that he was originally in it for the short squeeze, but now I think that he is truly in this company for the long run because of its potential, and I couldn't agree more!

**Who is Hindenburg Research?**

‚ÄúHindenburg Research‚Äù is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don‚Äôt care if they are right or wrong on their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù because they will profit on their short position regardless.

Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float ‚Äì these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their ‚Äúreports‚Äù).

Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM ‚Äì to name a few.

&#x200B;

**Where do they get their research?**

This is the million-dollar question.

They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.

In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on ‚Äúconversations they had‚Äù with undisclosed ‚Äúformer employees‚Äù of the company.

Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.

That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôs going to have too many nice things to say.

&#x200B;

**Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**

Let‚Äôs be clear. This is no Nikola.

Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.

Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a ‚Äúquiet-period‚Äù right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.

Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [‚Äúthorough‚Äù statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.

&#x200B;

**In summary:**

I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.

In addition, I‚Äôll let you be the judge ‚Äì should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?

What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.

I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.

&#x200B;

**I‚Äôll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?**

A 5-man ‚Äúresearch firm‚Äù ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.

Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn‚Äôt close out their short positions get burned this week ‚Äì and it begins tomorrow.

$RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place ‚Äì for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.

834,Bullish GME OBV Indicator,1640,m5lk3l,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5lk3l/bullish_gme_obv_indicator/,111,"This post is going to be a deep dive into the On-balance volume indicator for GME. Before I start, this is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I am but a simple, smooth-brained ape with StimmyYOLO dreams. 

**What is OBV**: On-balance volume is a technical indicator, which was founded on the idea that volume precedes price. OBV is calculated as a running total where the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). For example (these are arbitrary numbers), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. It's also important to note that if a candle stays the same, it is not added to OBV (this doesn't really matter for GME because its price RARELY stays the same). OBV is a trend indicator, so the actual value of OBV doesn't matter, the trend of OBV is what matters. Generally, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. I usually use OBV when a stock is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price.

**GME OBV Charts:** Here is GME's 1 year, 90 day, 30 day, and 10 day charts with volume and OBV. Volume is the graph with green and red candles below the chart and OBV is the tan line in the volume graph:

**Analysis:** The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move. 

**Now what:** I made a previous technical analysis on GME a few days ago (this one didn't have OBV because my smooth brain forgot to. Trust me, my wife's boyfriend was PISSED that I forgot, so I made this so he would let me sleep in the garage instead of under the deck tonight). In that post, I said ""Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume."" I'd just like to reiterate that. For another squeeze to happen, we need MASSIVE volume. OBV continually increasing is a good thing because it shows that volume is on the side of the buyer, so when volume increases, it will be easier for the price to skyrocket. In that post, I also said that in order for volume to increase, especially in the case of GME, there has to be a catalyst. Previous volume increases coincided with Ryan Cohen being added to the board, celebrities tweeting about GME, Shitron's short position, and the ousting of the CFO. I believe that we have a few upcoming catalysts that could help push up volume: Earnings, quadruple witching day (not a catalyst in and of itself but it is a day that always has significant volume), and any kind of announcement relating to getting a new CFO or Cohen doing something. The stimmys that so many of us have is just kerosine being added to that fire. 

**A note on predictions:** What I want to emphasize, especially for the new apes, is that while I believe this (the squeeze) will happen, do not get discouraged if it takes a while. WSB is a glorious hub of information. Much of this information is comparable to what actual analysts do (many people on CNBC have talked about the sophistication of WSB research). There are many DDs in this sub that explain why HFs are trying to delay the squeeze but that it's still inevitable. The catalysts that I mentioned are just that, catalysts - they are not predictions. So when you are up at 3am ripping your juul after having jacked off for the 5th time that day while and scrolling through the DD section on WSB, don't get tied down to dates and predictions. You should have conviction in your positions and if you are confident that it will rise based on technicals, fundamentals, and theories, the conviction of your play should not be affected by a date. Think of dates simply as ""oh something could happen on this day, but if not, IDGAF because I have conviction in my play."" 

Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor, I am a simple ape-cuck who seeks to please his wife's boyfriend. Stay strong APES.",2021-03-15 17:12:37

839,Gme isn't over,1608,m6hj9a,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6hj9a/gme_isnt_over/,174,"Hello retards,

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a ü•ñFrenchü•ê retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other. In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng üßªüôå). It also trigger stop loss (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE?

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data üñçÔ∏è to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions.

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our üåàüêª.

* ***üá∫üá∏ AMERICA üá∫üá∏***

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people üíñ) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge üöÄ tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win !

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose !

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet : ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.‚Äù

TLDR: Price down cause of short sells and üßªüôå ----> Solution = Buy now and hold üíéüôå for going to üöÄüåë

I like the stock (16.56@216)

Take a step back and look at the hourly time frame. GME had a huge 50+% day yesterday and dropped only <2% today. This is just healthy consolidation on LOW Daily volume.

This is what bulls want. RSI has cooled down on hourly. It's holding moving average supports and I'm thinking it will go back and retest today's highs next week. You want this to stair-step up when we don't have low volume and when big money steps in (notice how much room CMF has to curl up), then that's the big 20, 30, 40+% days.

849,The UWMC rocket,1555,m7plal,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7plal/the_uwmc_rocket/,504,"First off: I'm very bullish on GME, and I won't sell a single share for this play. However, I had some cash laying around in my brokerage account that I owe in taxes. And I don't want to feel any pressure about the squeeze having to happen before X or Y, so that money won't be going into GME. The squeeze will happen when it happens, and I can confidently say I can hold my shares for however long I need to do so.

So during the last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve seen UWMC being mentioned here. From what I understand, the company has pretty good fundamentals. They‚Äôre profitable, yada yada yada. However, I‚Äôm not looking for boomer stocks that give me a few percent of profit a year. I like rockets.But among the posts about UWMC, people were mentioning that there were a lot of options expiring on Mar 19. This piqued my interest. And I decided to take a look at the options chain myself.

I ran a script to collect the data from the Yahoo options chain on Mar 7th, and quickly realized that there are indeed a shit ton of calls. This is not a boomer stock. This is a rocket, primed for launch. I figured someone else was going to post about the options chain in a more exhaustive manner, but this never happened. However, the last date for optimal launch conditions is drawing close, and the stock price is finally seeing some nice upwards action. So I figured I'd take it upon myself to tell you all about the beautiful options chain.

Now, before we start, I should mention that my understanding of options is rather limited. Prior to the whole GME thing, ‚Äúoptions‚Äù primarily made me think about the menu where you can change the graphics fidelity and your controls in a videogame. So keep that in mind as you read this. I‚Äôm not the ideal person to be posting this.

The UWMC options chain had (as of Mar 7th - sorry about the outdated data, didn‚Äôt run the script since then, and the Yahoo IV seems to be scuffed right now) a total of 501,471 calls, with strike prices ranging from $1 to $25. As we all probably know by now, each call contract is worth 100 shares. This means that there were call contracts out there worth 50,147,100 shares.For a stock which has a public float of only \~90 million. Let that sink in. There are calls for literally 55% of the float.

I also went ahead and calculated approximate deltas for the various calls in order to calculate to which extent these calls are likely hedged. With the price at the time ($8.68), roughly 11.3 million shares would have been held by call writers, assuming all of them hedge according to delta, and calls worth 38.9 million shares would have been unhedged.

At a price of $10, the number of hedged shares should go up to roughly 16 million.

At $12, that number would be \~23 million.

At $14, \~28.9 million. At this point, there are still \~21.2 million shares that are unhedged.

And this just keeps going as the price reaches new heights. Basically RKT all over.

Now, the deltas would be slightly different today seeing as the delta calculation takes time until expiry into account, and a lot of the calls expire tomorrow, but the situation should still be *very* similar. Also, all of the calls aren‚Äôt written by market makers or by people who delta-hedge, but from what I understand, Market Makers do write the majority of call options.

TLDR:There are call options out there worth roughly 55% of the public float of UWMC. Potential for a massive gamma squeeze starting if the price goes up just a couple of dollars. EZ 2-bagger *with shares* before the week is over.

If the price doesn't go up soon enough, UWMC is apparently still a solid company, according to other posts on this sub. Boomer profits, maybe a 2-bagger with shares before the year is over.

Positions: 150 shares @ $9.06. No options because I‚Äôm not rich enough to set up an account at an american broker, and I can‚Äôt find any european brokers that offer options for american stocks.

This is obviously not investing advice. I barely understand how options work, and eat crayons for breakfast.

Edit: Market is open, yahoo IV is unscuffed. So I could get some fresh data.

Total open interest  is 543,817 for calls across all strike prices and dates. Table below is assuming 100% of calls are hedged according to delta. This is obviously not the case in reality, but I'm not sure what percentage would be a reasonable assumption, so just posting the raw results from my script here. Also, keep in mind my deltas aren't 100% correct, but rather just approximations. I'm too smoothbrained for using the real black-scholes algorithm.

Excerpt:

> Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

> It‚Äôs a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling‚Äîthe process of selling shares you don‚Äôt own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‚Äòphantom‚Äô shares‚Äîsurvives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it‚Äôs caused billions of dollars in damage.

> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

Also:

> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

Focus:

> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company‚Äôs share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

This predatory short activity by hedge funds did, in fact, happen to Canadian pot stocks before the COVID crash last year.

Which other Canadian stocks are being attacked like this?

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true üíéüôå

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/0qhnzm2rm5m61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aedb83543448c586fc3415ffe4c0c991f6bd16e4)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant üíé nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many üçå üçå üçå as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his üçå..

Being the ""predatory"" ü¶ç Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more üçå üçå . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar üöÄ travel still exist.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? ->! I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.!<

&#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/r3qxmmbum5m61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114542bfd9691be40edcc93e5f18397d360b5c2e)

&#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

&#x200B;

# The BIGGEST test of üíéüôå comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

&#x200B;

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* üöÄüöÄüöÄ)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider üìÑüôå and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! üíéüôå

&#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your üçå's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few üçå.

&#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 üçå @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS üçå - Price Rises.

üçå rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

(EDIT:  Hypothetically Billy could also do this - **üçå rises to $9001 (over 9000) - Billy releases 1 singular banana and covers all his initial cost and takes the wife and her boyfriend out for expensive McDonalds.. leaving 49 üçå for fuck you money**)

&#x200B;

Billy retains 42 üçå **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more üçåif there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&#x200B;

Billy is a smart ü¶ç

&#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

&#x200B;

# This empowers Billy.

&#x200B;

[BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" üíéüôå](https://preview.redd.it/llwytxlzm5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65d718cd902554ca26423734f66e971cd371a67)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own üçå üçå üçå üçå now. Some got a lot, others got 1 üçå - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

&#x200B;

[Yep. This dude. Fkn great for us apes, and the A-Team he brought with him! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dvn1t27n5m61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3161a08d422070f3ffbf455ba7ff400d86336fc)

&#x200B;

# Flash forward a few weeks or months...

# (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM too soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these üçåüçå before all this, and this will be the one and only üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&#x200B;

# ""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

&#x200B;

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

&#x200B;

# Billy Holds 42 üçå (Risk Free bananas, the sweetest kind)

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 1k

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 2k

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 64k

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 128k

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 256k

... You get Billys point.  


\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* - Billy is kinda pissed at the FUD and that blatant MSM cuck up the other day reporting early on a dump. So... Given the fact that GME Ownership is around 300% of float.. (With Retail unknown.. but I would imagine very high) We have \*NEW\* figures to potentially ""cover"" at.. See below for Billys revised listing:

&#x200B;

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 100k

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 200k

Billy releases 1 üçå @ 400k

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 800k

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 1.6m

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 3.2m

Billy Releases 1 üçå @ 6.4m

&#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 üçå ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 üçå left.... That's a fkn lot.

&#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 üçå @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

TL;DR - Cover initial investment for small portion of üçå at unspecified amounts/times - retain rest and let go 1 üçå at a fkn time. Simple. Not advice. Just common ape sense.

Notice we've been in that bearish funnel for a while now, and will probably test $150 before too long. After that's completed, I'm expecting to see a lot of support down there, but also intense volatility.

Now, if that holds, we're gonna try to swing up out of the channel; if it breaks, we're going down to test $115 as well.

Reason why I'm expecting us to be down is due options behavior around the next expiration dates:

&#x200B;

That's a huge short position expiring on April 1st. Also, notice how the calls/puts ratio drops from one expiration to another. To me this says people are waiting for the price to drop to get in cheaper.

**What this means is that there are 140,000+ call options that can be exercised at or near $10 this Friday 3/19.** To put this in context that's about 1000% more than the open interest in contracts expiring the following month. If the price reaches $10 and these contracts are exercised it will trigger the mother of all squeezes as each contract exercised will be a buy order of 100 shares. The more people buy the stock, the more it goes up...ape understand?

And it's not just this Friday. $UWMC is a GOOD COMPANY that nearly all analysts have pegged at a buy at current prices. It's about to be added to the Russel this month and for those looking for the full breakdown of the bull case for $UWMC **in the long term as well** and why this Friday is a MAJOR opportunity refer to the threads below:

**ACTION TO TAKE - BUY $UWMC before Friday while it's still under $10**. If we get it to $10 sit back, pop open a beer, and laugh as CNBC talks about how stupid we all are.

**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position in $UWMC. So, proceed on your own risk yada yada yada...**

Currently holding 200 @ $10.5 and 3/19 $11 calls

**EDIT TO ORIGINAL POST - - - -**

Alright seeing a lot of negative comments from confused apes out there so TO BE CLEAR

* **I am not** trying to steal attention away from your precious $GME 
* **I am not** saying the options expiring OTM will cause the price to increase
* **I am** saying that *if* the price reaches $10 by 3/19, those contracts can be **exercised OR sold**. **Selling the contracts produces the same result**, because they are bought by someone who will eventually exercises them (i.e. if a wsb ape sells his option instead of exercising it, it just get exercised by the buyer or whomever he sells it to). Sadly we do not live in a world rich enough yet that people will let ITM 0 DTE call options expire without getting their nut.
* **I am** saying that the price has to reach $10 for takeoff **by Friday**. This is realistic considering 3 million shares on 90 million float. Regardless I'd honestly recommend buying shares not options at these prices considering it still hasn't been added to the Russel. 
* **I am** your wife's boyfriend

With the current structure of the OI strikes, expiries and underlying price, $GME will be bleeding shares, dumped by MM because delta is decreasing due to theta. This phenomenon is particular in high IV stocks with a concentration of OI strikes above the underlying nearing expiry, ie like $GME.

To get back to Monday's price level, you guys need to either NET BUY 400MM USD(400 thousand **ü¶çü¶çü¶ç** with 1k üçåüçåüçå each)  worth of shares (not on RH since they may not be actually buying it but just give you an IOU instead), or Gamma up the ATM and near OTM options for 3/19 and 3/26. No, I'm not a HF shill or  a thetagang vampire, I'm being real, your stimmy won't be enough to move the market  by only  buying shares at this price point.

Ms Alexis Goldstein agrees that options probably contributed most of the volatility

I was reviewing the options chain for April 1st, and how much open interest there is:

&#x200B;

[\(+\/-50 is the amount of open interest 50 above\/below current price\)](https://preview.redd.it/cycosgy7q9q61.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=75885002583bc47574c5060828ad5dc7068f4177)

It looks like there are far more calls in the money or near the money. It looks like there are some major pain points on both sides depending on where it ends up Thursday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wu99jv3v9q61.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb708a31a5ea9544267dc993c22fdc999a60c2d

As you can see, it looks like $169 is the break even where there is the same amount of open interest. At the $220 mark we see a pretty massive shift, and at $250 puts are almost completely wiped out. If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592ca

It also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** Bears need $170 or below by EOW to gain the upperhand leading into next week. If it ends \~$180-$190, good chance we don't see too much of a change next week, maybe a bit of downward pressure. If we hit $250 by EOW, we **might** see something big happen.

&#x200B;

Edit: If you think this is a GME TO THE MOON THURSDAY post because of open interest I don't think you read it right. I am just expressing where I see a majority of the options rest and where  I think we might see a lot of action occur/what it might mean for next week (@ $170, $220 and $250). I've got 63 @ 151 avg, and just trying to figure out what sort of plan I have for buying, as holding is not sufficient for increasing my blood pressure.  ",2021-03-31 05:24:02

&#x200B;

I get it. We‚Äôre all more or less retarded semi-hominids around here. But we play with real money, and a lot of us seem to get caught up in the excitement of this casino and try to win the lotto without knowing what the fuck is going on.

I‚Äôd bet that most of us know how a stock works. Ape buy share, ape hold share. Yes, ape can lose money, but generally speaking, it probably won‚Äôt be a total loss (zero bananas for those who need the conversion).

Options are different. Way different. Stocks are like riding a cute ape-sized circus tricycle, and options are like driving an F1 car with the accelerator taped to the floor and all of the wheel lug nuts loosened. They can (and most do) go to zero. And they can (and often do) lose significant value at dizzying speed.

Every time I see a post that contains something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know how to spell opshuns, but I bought 35 naked OTM calls expiring tomorrow for $90,000‚Äù I just get disheartened. Because real people will lose lots of real money playing with options, and I get it - Market University comes for us all, but please, PLEASE at least educate yourself on options basics before jumping in. Watch some YouTube videos. InTheMoney has a good intro series that I‚Äôve seen, and there‚Äôs tons and tons of quality content. Learn about spreads to lower your risk and theta exposure, learn about the Greeks, learn about what premium actually is and how it affects your break even price. I see so many ‚Äúif this stonk gets to the strike price by exp it will print!‚Äù Like... no goddammit, at the strike will be worth zero dollars at expiration, and until you pass the strike plus what you paid for the option, you‚Äôre not making any money. You should be trading the contracts anyways, not holding to expiration (most people, I‚Äôd say).

Anyways, we‚Äôre all adults here, but I care about my fellow apes. Learn the shit, then hop in. You‚Äôll still probably lose everything, but at least you‚Äôll know the fuck why.

You‚Äôll get more financial advice reading the color names printed on crayon wrappings than listening to me.

edit: Thanks for awards and stuff and I'd like to add some resources for those smooth brained smooth operators who can figure out that making the pointer clickity clack on some blue text will help develop some brain wrinkles.

[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) \- good high level intro to what options are. They offer some paid content as well but I have not purchased it so good luck

[optionsplaybook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) \- my go-to when I need a refresher on [spreads and other strategies](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/). High level but super informative [once you've got the basics](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/). They split strategies into target audiences ([rookies](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/basic-option-strategies/), [veterans](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/veteran-option-strategies/), etc.)

InTheMoney's YouTube channel is a really good place to go to learn, he's got a lot of quality content and it's maybe on the longer side, but you gotta have something to do while your wife's boyfriend is taking care of business

TastyTrade is a firm / brokerage / content creator (I think?), and they do a lot of live trading and also have a lot of educational content that's worth checking out. They tend to focus on the selling of options and making money on the sell side, but they educate on options as a whole.

This is obviously not an exhaustive list, but it's all material that I've used in the past. Now what are you doing reading this when you could be liquidating your life savings on buying $800 calls for today.

2. **Cup:** The cup should be ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ¬Ω. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little wary, and I still stand by this. **Updated**: However, at this point we can say GME is not a textbook example so the depths might be less of a factor.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again? Updated:** At this point it may be safe to say that the textbook depths do not really apply. We have fallen out of 1/3 and even 1/2 depths, and there is reason to be wary. However, this might not really matter for GME.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. Almost there. **Updated: Check**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Updated: 50 Million Volume to go from closing 120 to closing 180. There is definitely momentum here. Previous resistance of 172 broken. Check**

Okay, so now let‚Äôs look at the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xt3t0v27hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cb794baa796b3147084a004f425523e2d72a6f

We can see here that +DI and -DI are diverging, signaling bullish sentiment. W%R slipped into a strong overselling signal on 3/24, and then on 3/25 it moved sharply towards the middle. This means the stock is starting to be more bought than sold. The MACD histogram is growing in momentum, 3/24 being the most negative day.

So great! It looks like there could be a breakout forming here. But now what? How long does it go for and what can we expect? Well let‚Äôs look at historical examples:

Here is the textbook Investopedia example, WYNN on monthly candles:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9otqyu887hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d2c757c8c2795ae0382155dfa9c5316ea88fc3

We can see that when there is a breakout in the handle, the bullish movement pushed the price to go above previous cup resistances. However, after the breakout the price of the stock free falls down almost to previous cup support levels:

&#x200B;

Okay now you may be saying, this is so zoomed out and candles are months ect, ect, ect. This is simply the Investopedia textbook example. Lets look at another more recent one.

Here is NVDA on daily candles:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpwtlgrb7hp61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e72aac25924a18b7f8d2a4b6f1c125e39697cd

Here is what happened after the run up, as you can see this stock kept running up after the handle breakout:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mctgfxpe7hp61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e9b7105444cbc54cf0831fc71323ded4c1a595

All of this is just information. I hope you take it with a grain of salt! If a true cup with handle pattern forms and the breakout of the handle happens, then we know prices run up at least to the previous resistance. Until that happens its hard to say what's next!

Something is clearly being manipulated to prevent it from attaining it‚Äôs actual worth. I am tired of reading people commenting that it‚Äôs worth nothing.

What do fundamentals mean anymore? Look at Tesla. You can‚Äôt go by fundamentals alone. So those of you saying the fundamentals aren‚Äôt there, STOP FOLLOWING WHATS HAPPENING WITH GME, move on we don‚Äôt need you. This is about upholding a brand that we believe in and we want to succeed. 

I have wanted to sell, but after seeing how much it is being manipulated, I will never sell. There‚Äôs much more at stake than getting a quick ROI. In January, it would have easily hit 1k if it weren‚Äôt for the cowardly actions of corporations.

Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.

**$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.

[$AMC, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING - Price goes UP](https://preview.redd.it/8cxvnms99mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b117cb869ad073ba1fdb3cc922b70461959c46d3)

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

[$GME, BLUE IS SHORT COVERING](https://preview.redd.it/fohleedr9mn61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=008c2d653462aa98f9c4ae3f4d897595a196df77)

&#x200B;

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**  
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**

We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!  


**EDIT: 4PM Aftermarket**  
Jowell and Fed Reserve today told us they will continue to support the economy, inflation is UNDER CONTROL, bonds chilled out. Recovery looks promising and we're on the right track. Markets re-bounded strong!  


**GME is COMPLETELY PRICE PINNED at $209! Trading sideways. These guys have it under complete control!**  


$BB closed up 1.22% and is flaky after-market  


$AMC closed 3.84% and is rising 3% after market! Go AMC!  


$NOK closed .9% and is up a bit after-market!  


$RKT is COMPLETELY CONTROLLED! They have this price pinned at EXACTLY $24.50. I've never seen anything like it. Complete manipulation.

Investopedia defines Greater Fool Theory as follows:

*The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.*

Now you may be thinking, **are we the greater fools?** I bought at 250 like a good little ape, and my answer is *no*.

First, let's acknowledge that GME is not worth $200, or $300, or $420.69, or $8008.101 . We aren't betting on the actual value, we're betting on the greater fools. We're betting on the short squeeze, and *its day will come*.

The shorts will have to buy, no matter the price, so in this scenario *they are the greatest fools of all*.

Melvin, Shitron, and other HF's will devolve below the monke and turn into single celled organisms only capable of breeding and shitting.

How can I confirm this? Lets do some retard math.

The average IQ defined in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale is 90-109, and since we're smooth brained, and in the ""Extremely low"" category, we're defined as 69 and below. So let's say we're all 69(nice). There are 9,665,680 r/WSB members at the time of writing. Multiply total users by 69 and we get **666,931,920**. With our combined monke IQ's we have decided we like the stock. Melvin has 33 employees, who we'll say are in the ""Superior"" IQ classification of 130 and above. Using maths, we can conclude their combined IQ is 4,290. So who is the greater fool, Melvin, who doesn't like the stock with an IQ of 4,290, or r/WSB, with a combined retard strength of 666,931,920 who like stonk.

So get your chickens ready, the deep fryer is heating up and tendies will be ready soon.

**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**

Huge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**

**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS‚Äôs proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company‚Äôs technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS‚Äôs upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play ‚Äì buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn‚Äôt have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company‚Äôs potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I‚Äôll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner‚Äôs product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages

$AMRS‚Äôs consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS‚Äôs progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS‚Äôs tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more
