 I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1) current product portfolio

2) product pipeline

3) existing retail distribution with more on the way

4) 1+ million existing customers

5) FDA clinical trials already underway

6) robust R&amp;D process

7) $300+ million on the balance sheet

8) strong brand awareness and NPS scores

9) strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]

10) seasoned management team

  **FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1) current product portfolio

2) product pipeline

3) existing retail distribution with more on the way

4) 1+ million existing customers

5) FDA clinical trials already underway

6) robust R&amp;D process

7) $300+ million on the balance sheet

8) strong brand awareness and NPS scores

9) strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]

10) seasoned management team

  **FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

I have been watching the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me.

How will shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.

1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.

2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. 

Well you heard of interstellar 🪀 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.

How does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. 

The theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud how do they do that? Well.. 

Most people are getting a $1400 check which they should be buying food and shit with hut are buying FDs and stonks. 

Effectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? 

You first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. 

Now how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.

Queue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. 

FOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. 

Considering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. 
If you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.

Im no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. 

Shitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.

Jdst, jnug, amd, vix, uvxy i have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.

I have been watching the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me.

How will shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.

1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.

2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. 

Well you heard of interstellar 🪀 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.

How does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. 

The theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud how do they do that? Well.. 

Most people are getting a $1400 check which they should be buying food and shit with hut are buying FDs and stonks. 

Effectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? 

You first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. 

Now how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.

Queue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. 

FOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. 

Considering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. 
If you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.

Im no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. 

Shitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.

Jdst, jnug, amd, vix, uvxy i have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.

Tl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement?

So isn't it surprising that with the stimulus package quickly moving through the House and will probably pass fairly quickly through the Senate, and the fact that demand for silver metals have gone up, the price for $SLV and silver miners have been going down?

**It's obvious that $SLV doesn't carry the amount of silver metals it says it is carrying, and that big fund managers and banks are trying to drive the price down to avoid paying off contracts and earning a grip load of money in the process when the price of SLV should be shooting up?** OUR MONEY IS BEING LOST in SLV while everyday we hear stories of inflation, and that people would rather put their money into shitcoins, stocks, and pokemon cards rather than cash.

It's a closed end fund, and they won't create new shares unless they actually acquire more silver. 

**BUY ACTUAL SILVER** Difficult to do, especially with the high premiums they put on to stop us from driving up the market. But if you can do it. Otherwise buy PSLV on a different exchange. Got it?

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

**OVERVIEW:**

Owlet Baby Care building the premier baby-tech company with the connected nursery and digital parenting platform as part of the larger ecosystem. Just like Peloton is building a hardware/software/subscription ecosystem for fitness — Owlet is doing the same thing for parents and caretakers.

I’m not a parent so I can’t speak to these topics from personal experience but I have 5 nieces and 4 nephews plus many of my closest friends are parents so I know first hand how obsessed new parents are with their babies and how they are in a constant state of worry and panic. Every time their baby gives them a funny look or starts to cry they begin to freak out. Obviously these fear dissipate over time but how amazing is it that now we have a company like Owlet that is providing the products and services to make the parents job a little easier and less chaotic.

Owlet has already developed a very strong brand in the baby-tech industry with great retail partnerships, numerous awards and a strong IP portfolio ([patent search on USPTO website](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=owlet&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=owlet)) but going public via $SBG will increase awareness of their products and help them hit their ambitious business goals.

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

Owlet is redefining the way in which parents are supported by technology and empowering them to proactively monitor the health of their newborns to not only protect the baby but also give them piece of mind.

The baby-tech industry is many years behind most consumer tech markets so it’s excited to think that we have a chance to get in early while this trend is just taking off. As you can see below, thousands of babies die every year from SUID (sudden unexpected infant death) and Owlet can help prevent this.

Just like car seats are a must-have product for every parent to keep their baby safe in the car, I expect the Owlet smart sock to keep their baby safe the other 23 hours of the day.

Owlet has a huge lead on other baby-tech companies with their world-class design and engineering team plus years of gathering and analyzing data. They already have 1+ million customers and with the brand loyalty they have developed it now gives them the platform they need to launch new products and expand the ecosystem thus creating more LTV (lifetime value) from each customer.

Let’s also not overlook the fact that 4+ million babies are born every year in the US which give Owlet a constant new supply of customers and their loving parents who want to keep them safe and healthy.

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1. current product portfolio
2. product pipeline
3. existing retail distribution with more on the way
4. 1+ million existing customers
5. FDA clinical trials already underway
6. robust R&amp;D process
7. $300+ million on the balance sheet
8. strong brand awareness and NPS scores
9. strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]
10. seasoned management team

**FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.

We are all here for one main goal and that is making money together and removing it from the pockets of the big hedge fund companies thence placing it into ours!!!  CAN WE ALL AGREE?  So let’s beef up our pockets right now today, we all have the opportunity as we always do to come together and take aim at something we can all afford as we know the GameStop stock has sky rocketed in price and if we all want to continue pushing together we need to liquidate some more money into our pockets to do so in which Sundial is the perfect target to make a massive push today and then all earnings we take together from this we use to make history in the GSE push.  This is a one day squeeze here with a stock starting under $2.00 at the current time in which we can all afford to buy and use to beef up our pockets to make our GSE HISTORY PUSH.  I come to my fellow reddit people, we started this together and we shall continue this together. This is one of the most wonderful things to see is when the people come together as a whole in aims to make something special happen and we are right here so close.  So I say to everyone, while it is on the low side, let’s make this money together and continue riding this rocket into history on the biggest squeeze of all time.
