3,gpl62qv,Did you try triggering the transfer from the bank side?  There may be additional forms that need to be filled out.  Plus it could end up taking a few days or weeks.,8,0,1614810846,TheSheibs
4,gpl63oy,I emailed them almost everyday until they unrestricted it. They made me send copies of my ID and bank statements before they would give it back to me.,8,0,1614810858,MysteriousTie69

8,gpl91rv,"I initiated a partial transfer of anything I was long on to Fidelity in early Feb, and they denied it, claiming I was transferring assets I didn't own (I have no margin enabled). They won't inform me as to which assets I supposedly didn't own.

Now I'm just waiting to close my shorter positions, and I got rid of any fractional shares. I'll transfer everything wholesale and withdraw the cash then.",5,0,1614812255,prometheus2508

12,gplfs7z,RH does not care who they fuck over. They are trying to go public. They are trying to keep that money in the house. It looks like they are pulling every dirty trick in the book . Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (the EFTA)  Good luck,3,0,1614815618,Both_Selection_7821

14,gplg1uy,"You bring up a good point.  Most brokers, like Fidelity, will not accept fractional shares.  So you would have to close the positions and transfer the cash, then repurchase the shares.",1,0,1614815756,TheSheibs
15,gpljeeo,Ya retard they don't have the cash on hand to pay transfers.  As of 12/31/20 they only had 137mil$ cash.  This is the reason they are scrambling to IPO,1,0,1614817512,ContestImpressive
