9,gphvcno,"As much as I would love RKt to run up, this post is incredibly misleading. That information via fintel it’s a very small sample size from one brokerage firm. That specific firm has 15,000 shares available to short. There are millions of available shares to short across all brokerages. This is simply a small sample size. Read the first pic provided by OP. 

Again, I want and believe RKt isn’t done. But this is straight up lying.",42,0,1614742846,Justkohn1

17,gphwd9u,"No prob. People need to understand that there’s a huuuuuuuge difference between RKT and GME. GME was a small cap, $2 billion company. And there weren’t many shares available. It’s entirely possible that WSB had a major hand in what happened. But RKT is a $40 billion company. With millions and millions of available shares. To think that even 8 million retail traders could move this stock the way its moved is ridiculous. It’s clearly institutional investors.  Either get on for the ride or don’t. But let’s not pretend like “we” can actually control anything that happens with RKT.",27,0,1614743395,Justkohn1
