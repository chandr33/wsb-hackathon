Calls are the real YOLO money but Calls are expensive.

We know Hedge Fuckery occurs during the lunch rush because we are too busy assembling Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers to trade.

Call options are at their cheapest closest to expiration.

So why not wait until after the lunch rush dip on the expiration date and Leeroy Jenkings as many Calls as you can afford?

I asked a non-retard and they said this:

*That's prolly a good idea when it is so close to expiry the change in delta required by market makers is much greater and thus bigger squeezes.*

I don't know what that says because every time I attempt to read it my brain keeps making Ferrari noises. I think it says Ape Do Good.
