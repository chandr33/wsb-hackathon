30,gpiijdx,"the easiest way to conceptualize option prices is probability. anything that increases the probability of an option going in the money increases the value of the option. so as the stock price approaches the strike price, as volatility increases, and if you have more time before the contract expires, these factors increase the option price. for example, stock xyz has a stock price of 100. a call option with a strike price of 101 and expires in 30 days has a very high probability of finishing above 101 in 30 days and therefore would be pretty expensive. a call option with a strike price of 120 and expires in 3 days has a very low chance of finishing above 120 in 3 days so this option would be pretty cheap.

i sold covered calls on RKT today when it was trading at 41. the strike i sold was 50 expiring on 3/19. the premium i received was 700 per contract and i sold 13 contracts so i got 9100 this morning. if RKT doesn‚Äôt finish above 50 on 3/19, i keep the shares and the premium. if it finishes over, i have to sell the shares at 50, even if the stock price is way past 50.",12,0,1614759382,l0wryda

49,gpj90vu,"Experience. I've been at this game a long time. I paid my dues tho. It's easier than most think but few master controlling their mind to fit the game. Instead they let the game dictate their decisions through emotions. I was no different at first (1990s). I quickly learned if I dont ""get with the program"" the program was going to take all my money so I started studying. Not studying TA books. Studying price action and relationships. There are repeating patterns all over the place. Finding them is easy once you know what to look for. And hard AF when you dont. 

UWMC was an incredible value in the 7s and 8s but everyone was bitching about what a disaster investment it became. Stocks move for reasons that dont need understanding. Buying profitable stocks at deep discounts compared to their peers can be easy money. I knew all about rocket since the beginning. Didnt like the valuation or price action. UWMC on the other hand (rkt's closest competitor in the stock mkt) was trading ridiculously cheap in comparison
 Like stupid dumb cheap. Sector peers at deep discounts are an indication of a price inefficiency. It always resolves. Sometimes it takes years and sometimes it happens overnight. The only way to know is to have a strategy and buy it when it feels like a terrible time to buy. 

Nobody likes buying a used and abused stock. Not even me. It feels plain wrong. However, what feels wrong in this game is more often the right thing to do. Your mind will fight you tooth and nails to not do ""wrong things"". But you have to set aside all that emotional stuff and focus on the hard data of the opportunity.

ETA: I make plenty of bad trades. The idea was sound. The DD was sound. The entry was rock solid. But it goes to hell anyway. But since I had a plan from the beginning it's not a mistake or an error. It just didnt work out. It happens constantly. You only need to be profitable on 50% of your trades to make money as long as your avg gains are bigger than your avg losses.

52,gpjh09m,"Ya that‚Äôs the difference between covered and naked. Naked would mean he has to buy them at market and sell at the strike. So infinite potential of loss. Covered calls, you already own them so you miss out on the opportunity for selling higher is the only risk. But you collected a premium to start. 

Buy 100 shares at $8. (Balance is -800 cash and 100 shares)

Sell a contract for $10 strike price. Premium of $1 per share. You collect $100 when you sell the covered option. (Balance is -700 cash and 100 shares) 

Say stock gets to $12 on expiration. You now sell those 100 shares for $10 each. So you get $1000 more. But you coulda gotten $1200 if you sold market price, so missed out on the $200. (+300 cash and 0 shares. $200 profit from selling $2 increase and $100 from premium) 

The other way, say stock goes to $9. call expires. You still own the stock. And you collected $100 (-700 cash and 100 shares. Could sell shares for 900 and be at $200, or sell another call. If you never sold an option, you‚Äôd have $100 in gains total). 

So you lose less potential money due to collecting some premium. But could miss out on a lot of potential profit if the stock rises very far. But I think in the end it‚Äôs a lower risk play and kinda plays both sides. If stock goes down a lot you still own it, collected premium, and can continue to hold if you believe in it long term.",7,0,1614784312,uFFxDa

What‚Äôs cool is if you sell a covered call for a higher strike price than you purchased, and it gets executed, you will make money from the increase in share price and the premium.

Let's say he bought 100 shares at $7, and sells/writes a call with a strike price of $20/share. He pockets the premium.

Some time later the option expires. Let's say the current price is $22. This means the option is in the money and will be exercised. He still gets the strike price of $20/share, or a total of $2000 (plus the premium). His loss is not being able to profit from the additional $2 per share. 

If the option is barely in the money, the premium may outweigh that lost potential. But let's say the stock price went to $50. The extra $30 per share is all potential gains he could have had.

91,gpl9txn,"Options have nearly uncountable ways to trade them. First pick a specific strategy then start researching. Most people here just buy out of the money calls hoping to hit a lottery. Which is fun AF but low probability of profit. I generally dont trade options like that. My 3 favorite option strategies are buy/write, cash secured puts, and hedging downside.

 If you own a stock going into ER or FDA approval (or any binary catalyst), it's always good practice to hedge with inexpensive out of the money puts. That way if things go wrong, you can still profit on puts to offset losses with your shares. When a hedge pays I usually buy more shares with the proceeds. Very powerful really. 

My fave is ""buy/write"". Endless youtube vids and blogs to read up on that strategy. It's a serious money maker once you get good at it. Not exciting money or fast money. Prob why few do it here. But over the long term it's incredibly profitable. 

I always tell people the same thing when they ask me about good books to read... Controlling the psychological part of trading/investing is FAR more important than technical books of any kind. If you dont have the right mindset, it makes no difference how technical smart you are. You will fail and lose money. Check out Trading in the Zone or any trading psychology book.
