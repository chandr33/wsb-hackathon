0,gqd0swg,Very little of this money is going to people. It's mostly going to the corporations and billionaires that sponsor politicians. I don't think this massive inflation spike will hit as soon as you think. Even if it does happen traditionally stocks are the safest hedge.,1,0,1615317077,ar15andahalf

2,gqd1d9i,"If the USD has hyperinflation (like Zimbabwe's 79,000,000,000%) the Treasury is burning.  Load up on physical  silver and copper.   Gold is worth too much to practically barter with.   Bullets and equipment to reload too.

TIPS could be great in a high inflation (like the 70s) environment.   Although many appreciating assets will be fine as well.   I'm really curious what high inflation would to do our consumer culture.  Increasingly credit costs vs ""it'll be more expensive next month/year"".",2,0,1615317333,cjc4096
3,gqd2ybo,"How much inflation are you anticipating? I'm thinking at worst it will get to a $4/gallon for unleaded in the summer which will increase prices on food and travel, and should go back down on November.

If you worry about hyperinflation, then only growing your own food and not renting is the way to go. Maybe even having stockpile of essentials and perhaps even amo.",3,0,1615318043,Nutatree

5,gqdjozc,"CPE/CPI is a scam

In an increasingly globalized/centralized economy any monetary expansion is increasingly (and with greater efficiency) trapped in appreciating assets (stock, bonds, real estate, swaps). This is reflected statistically in the decreasing velocity of money which counteracts any small amount of real inflation which is mostly dependent on wages and taxes (which we all know have been flat in real terms for 40 years). 

Sure in the short term we may have a small spike in prices after reopening but there is a reason the FED isn't worried about it and in this case it isn't just Jerome jawboning",1,0,1615325466,PajeetScammer
6,gqdloby,There is no threat of hyperinflation and anyone who believes otherwise is a moron but go ahead and spend money to hedge against your bogeyman if you want,1,0,1615326357,NaFun23
7,gqdtamv,TIPS end up being VERY long maturity which means they have a lot of interest rate risk if rates rise. They are also tax inefficient as they are taxed at your federal tax bracket. Better off in STIP for shorter maturity or more preferable in CPI swaps which look to 5 year forward inflation expectations.,1,0,1615329926,KingCuerv0
