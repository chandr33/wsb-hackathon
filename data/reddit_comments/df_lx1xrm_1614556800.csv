LETS BE ON OUR:

BUY HODOR

**FOR THE SQUEEZE:**

***Limit Sell Order: $999,999.99***

As of now we’re all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you’re unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you’re concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!

$999,999.99

Let’s ALL get THE BEST PRICE!
