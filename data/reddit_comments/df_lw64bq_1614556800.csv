29,gpfkim5,"Ha.  Itâ€™s a slow decline.  It goes down and then up a little. Then down more then up a little. You know when it goes down more than it goes up and the trades are all
In the single digits itâ€™s losing money right.  When all of the single digit shares are being sold so they can make it to the weed shop before it closes or so they wonâ€™t have to mow their parents lawn this weekend to buy a 12 pack of white claw.",1,0,1614704166,HarryManback6252
30,gpfl0oz,"when ur wife is with her boyfriend, she goes down, then up a little. Then down more, then up a little. You know when she goes down more than she goes up, and when her thrusts are all in the single digits, she's gonna cum, right. When all the single thrusts are done so she can cum all over her boyfriend before he does so she can slightly abate herself of the crippling depression and regret she experiences having married you",1,0,1614704379,kmca17
31,gpfl8z9,"Ok that's fair everyone has their own way to investing in the market. But what makes you say that people will sell? Contrary to your statement people are still buying the stocks. I don't know if you know (and most people in wsb as well) this is more like HF vs HF and us in the WSB are just along for the ride. If you look at the institutional holders of GME they are also buying up shares and its more like the big HFs are trying to take out the little HFs. Maybe you are right but one thing for sure is that the price will at least increase til tomorrow for all the ITM calls that has to be executed by Wednesday. Well let's see what will happen next week and hope for the sake of others the stock will hold. Oh lastly, can you explain why you think the price will decrease? I am legitimately curious because I also believe that if a squeeze will happen again it won't be like the one in January because at this point HFs have already purchased call options for them to easily move in the long position from their shorts and may keep the price relatively reasonable as they can sell their sells to offset the price movement.",1,0,1614704481,Jealous_Object4137
