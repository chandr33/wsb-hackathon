2,gqa0ioz,"I'm currently living with my parents for the first time in 10 years because Kansas law states that there's no such thing as job security, and your job can drop you with 0 reason or consequence... or say if the 2nd crew committed a large safety violation that cost the company contracts, so they cut *all* the way back on staff.

So I'm hoping I can pay off back-rent from my eviction, (due to losing my job kek) a credit card I used for food/gas to go job hunting, pay off my car and maybe get the fuck outa my parents garage.

Also, wsb has almost no control over the price of this stock or any stock through shares. The only reason this started in the first place is because of options induced gamma squeezes.

I think these are the people you see constantly buying high, selling as soon as its down and repeating. Jumping from whatever stock is opening at the daily biggest mover.

IMO people that don't understand won't be interested in a five minute halt to begin with because most people holding a metric fuck tonne do understand and know its actually a fail safe to stop price moving too much, they just look for a smarter ape to tell them what's going on.

75,gqa8s8n,"I‚Äôll be blunt, I don‚Äôt believe this idea. I disagree with you because the fallout from the Fed halting all trading on the basis of a bad bet made by a couple large players on Wall Street would be nil compared to what happened if they shut down the market to protect these losing hedge funds. 

Think about what would happen if you went to sell something in your portfolio, and you just, couldn‚Äôt? You‚Äôd be like what the fuck? It‚Äôs my money, give it to me. The fallout from the Fed allowing these firms an out by halting would shake the very pillars that the free market is based on, and would violate every principle of faith that people have in the market. If they pressed pause, then after they pressed unpause, the run on the market would be cataclysmic. The elite have shown that there is no way for them to lose their own game as opposed to just letting a couple large hedge funds die, the resulting disaster would be way way worse. They will let the hedgies die, bail out whatever is left (it‚Äôs not going to a million though, so it‚Äôll stop at the Brokers/DTCC, there wouldn‚Äôt be a bailout) and then resume operations. 

The market will be fucked for some time. But that money doesn‚Äôt just evaporate. People are going to buy things, or throw it right back into the market while everything is on discount. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be like 2008, it‚Äôll be like March 2020.

Also, the boomer platforms usually take a .01% commission or something per trade, whereas Robinhood was free. They WANT you to have access to the market so they can make money too.
