18,gqf7dpr,"There is one difference between now and before, an important one:

Before, we could be sure that all the shorts were in below gme's previous all-time high (about $62, back in 2008), with most probably in below it's more recent high of about $40 back in 2016; we could also know that the gamma squeeze was capped because no call options bigger than I think $60 were available. This meant that the gamma squeeze was rapid and ended above $60, since all the call options by then were 100% covered, and any squeeze above that was entirely short-squeeze.

Today it's a little different: with contracts available up to $800, brokers buying shares to cover calls will continue pretty much linearly as the price goes up but will cap out just around $800. This means a much less sudden gamma squeeze.

The other factor is that new shorts opened positions on the way down from $480, and they don't lose as easily this time, because they're still making money so long as the price remains below their entry point, which could be over $450 for some.

What this means is that instead of gamma squeeze then catapulting us into a short squeeze, this time we are looking at a more even mixture of both, with the short squeeze happening in full throttle only above the previous high, and that short squeeze then catapulting us into a mushrooming gamma squeeze as we reach $800.

In my view, this means a realistic price target of over $800 is an exit point to consider; after $800 the gamma squeeze is over and the short squeeze by itself this time doesn't have the same potential since it is no longer shorted over 100%.",1,0,1615359606,democritusparadise

And if they do it‚Äôs a huge buying opportunity and if this thing ever gets back around 100 it‚Äôll explode again... I think the point of all this is that this stock is undervalued and the true market cap potential is 30-50b which would be 400+/share for a true value (30b/69m is 434/share price).. if this thing can be a hugely profitable company then the true value of the stock can be 400+ so it‚Äôll just start trading around that naturally.

46,gqfbjva,"Wrong about the gamma squeeze part. 

For a gamma squeeze in relation to effect it's cheapest to buy just otm calls. For your example of 10$ stock calls striking at 11$, 12$, 13$. In the relation to the cost of the writers delta hedge are the cheapest to force a gamma squeeze. The calls itself might be pricier, but for every dollar you spend you get more gamma squeeze. 

But the higher strike calls need not to be missing. Once the writers start covering for potential losses by buying shares, they break through the 11$, 12$, 13$ strikes. For the gamma squeeze to continue you need more just otm calls then, at 14$, 15$, 16$. And so on",1,0,1615363401,Hagizzo
