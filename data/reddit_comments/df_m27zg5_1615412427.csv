19,gqhwupc,"I'm thinking about using margin on Robinhood (Don't worry, my biggest positions are on TDA NOT Robinshitty) and have some questions/concerns.

If I have $20k in GME, can I borrow $10k of margin? What's the limit? How can I know how much I can borrow?

Lastly, if I do get $10k on margin, thus making my position $30k total, and I lose $20k of that, I'm still good then, right? I wont owe Robinhood anymore than the interest I paying? I think at that point I'd get a margin call anyway. But I just want to make sure I understand it completely.

Thanks in advanced. I'm most likely not going to use margin (Especially on Robinhood) but it's good info for me to know in the long term",0,0,1615412448,Zaryeah

Started the day with 195 @ $150 average. Set a limit order for 40 at $250 didn‚Äôt hit. So then as we poked around 300 I said fuck it I‚Äôm gonna drop 5k so I got 17 @ $294. So here I am sitting with 212 @ $161.54 average. Then boom we are off I‚Äôm sitting in a great spot. Here is where the cuck bitch part comes. My wife is like now this time you can‚Äôt lose money. So I said ok I‚Äôll put a stop loss on for $200. Had a zoom meeting as we start poking around $340. Thought I was good I haven‚Äôt taken my eyes off the chart for 2 weeks. The volatility fucked me. If I knew it was dropping that fast I would have cancelled the stop loss. Oh it gets worse. So then as it‚Äôs sitting in the 190 range I try buying back all my shares but at a discount. Thinking bet I‚Äôll make an extra 2k right here. But kept saying not enough $$$, insufficient funds. Come to find out the stop loss filled at $180 yes $180. By the time my stupid ass figured this out I bought at 264. Lesson 1, don‚Äôt be a cuck bitch and listen to your wife.
