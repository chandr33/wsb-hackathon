7,gqdv2mq,"So first, Chipotle P/E has always been way out of wack.

Second, the restaurant industry as a whole is getting murdered. Except Chipotle has a good digital offering, and their digital sales are up like 5X since COVID started. Also Chipotle has high quality food and caters to the white collar workers that have all kept their jobs.

Also, they have $1B in the bank and have finally started doing menu innovation responsibly (they recently announced cauliflower rice, and they announced quesadillas online today). They have about 3000 restaurants, have previously said they have room to get to 5k+ restaurants just with Chipotle... Also, all their previous new concept exploration was done under the old CEO. New CEO could probably execute new concepts well. Think another 5k restaurant potential per additional successful concept...

And they haven't truly expanded internationally yet, so they have the opportunity to do that as well.

Anyway, that's pretty much the bull case.  Most of this information is probably out of date. I am an ape. Not investment advice. Has anyone seen my green crayons? My mouth tastes like wax.",2,0,1615330781,otherguy
