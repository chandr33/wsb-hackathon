59,gqi4n8u,"Yep, great analogy. It's like when a celebrity dies and there's a Variety article published about it (within minutes) before the celebrity's family even knows of the death. Part of it is because people follow these things closely (especially news sites) and need to be the first to break the story, and part of it is because most of the article is pre-written and the specifics get plugged in at the end.

It's similar to how you can find false headlines about a new president (who lost the election) and why kids in Africa wear the false Super-Bowl-winning team's outfit (who actually lost the game).",1,0,1615416027,Frogma69
