32,gqbhaof,Attention fellow 🦍 I took into account the influx of new puts (shorts) and divided them by the calls(shares) when you factor in the short interest float and divide it by the p/e ratio multiply that number by retail hodlers and fellow institutional hodlers. The Q4 earnings report typically does an inflation on the underlying value of the bottom. The new sell wall is at 220 but during premarket heroes won't get margin called so they are buying and selling to avoid this. TLDR 🚀🚀 the squeeze will sqoized on april 31^st and will max out at $420.69,1,0,1615291172,Guitar_Strap
