6,gqgpafr,"A lot of hedge funds are probably swing trading GME at this point. Meaning they will make money all the way to Valhalla and back to earth. They have superior execution so they can sell in a downward trend faster. Some might be loosing millions, but others are making millions. 

Honestly the current price movement with GME is basically a pyramid scheme. It keeps going up because people already in the pyramid are convincing others to buy in. That only works so long as new buy-ins continue to rapidly flow in. Once momentum slows people at the bottom will start selling to lock in profits. And people at the top are suddenly going to be holding huge bags.

At some point, maybe after a squeeze, maybe not, GME is going to dive down faster than it rocketed up.",2,0,1615394946,OldSoul-YoungLibido
