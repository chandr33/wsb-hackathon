11,gplkx5e,"Where do they get the shares from?  Most lenders are institutional owners.  They tend to be longer term holders and use the borrow fees to boost their returns.

Robinhood doesn't broker short sales (other than the brief time between when your get assigned on the short leg of a call spread and when they buy you in) so they don't need to borrow anything.  They are purely lenders.  The short seller's broker would just borrow the shares from somewhere else. There are lots available so it's no big deal -- it would happen automatically and a human would never notice.

This is not a short squeeze because the SI is so low.  There's nothing to squeeze.  End of January was a short squeeze -- extremely high short interest, stock more or less impossible to borrow, and sky high borrow fees.  And even with all those conditions in place it took months for the squeeze to start.  This time, none of those conditions are in place.

Don't believe all the nonsensical conspiracy theories you read on this sub.  Most of them are people who were not smart enough to sell as $400 (or worse, bought at those levels) and are now trying to convince themselves that that actually wasn't a short squeeze and the shorts didn't really cover, despite the fact that all the data says otherwise.  They are hoping against hope that there will be a repeat of Jan 27-29, despite the fact that the conditions are completely different.

-	let‚Äôs say the last trade you‚Äôve done was this Monday
-	you need to wait that day plus 3 days for the ability to turn off instant settlement (so monday, plus 3 days therefore on friday you are allowed to turn off)
-	at any point during those 3 days, you are still allowed to trade just the date you can turn off instant settlement gets reset if you do
-	on friday, once you click turn off instant settlement, it says you cannot do any trades during this period (i think 2 days). but if you do make any trades, it cancels the instant settlement turn off
-	so basically it‚Äôs zero risk to turn it off

also not to mention the squeeze is gonna last atleast 2 to 5 days so not that big of a chance to miss it
