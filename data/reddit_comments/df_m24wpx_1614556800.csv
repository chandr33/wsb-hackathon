1,gqh78gg,"If he was one of us, he wouldn't of tried to illegally threaten to take workers stock options away when they tried to unionize, or even better if he was one of us he'd be fucking poor. I'm also so fed up of people sucking his meme sharing dick",1,0,1615401590,Soapysoap93
2,gqh8mli,"No, but he can either join us or quit acting like he is. He doesnt have to buy stock, but he is bitch made for using fans to profit, and then going dark on them. Doesnt seem like the kind of guy?I want to rally with.",1,0,1615402150,Herb_da_okay

Everyone laughed and thought i was being silly. And now look what happen.",1,0,1615402402,XInvestorr
6,gqha3eo,"The point im making is that, he gets on social media and promotes crap with quick whip comments and posts, and then turns around and pisses on the same people hes prompting to motivate/act in accordance with his ideaology at the time.
