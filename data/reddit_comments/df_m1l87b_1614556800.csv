2. Depends on your circumstances and where you bank.  I've taken out $50k personal loans in 30 minutes.  Small credit unions are awesome.  I've  got a large HELOC that I can access any time I want, as well as high limit credit cards that I could wire money to a broker with.  I don't do that because I'm not THAT retarded, but I could.
3.  There are 9 million people here.  Some rich, some poor, some with excellent credit, others not so much.  I'm guessing there is a lot better access to money around here than you'd think.",4,0,1615342020,chiefoogabooga
