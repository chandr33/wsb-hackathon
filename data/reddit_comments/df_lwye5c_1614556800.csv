7,gpjwujg," **What we're hearing:** Economists say it's unlikely the Fed will reignite its quantitative easing program as central banks in Australia and Korea [have announced in recent days](https://www.axios.com/central-bankers-bond-yields-33b50de9-bd2c-438e-9b7e-f5d3f8fd2a08.html) but could restart Operation Twist.

**What it means:** Operation Twist III, as it's been dubbed by economists (because it would be the third time the Fed has used the tool), would see the Fed selling some of its short-dated U.S. Treasury bonds and buying longer-dated bonds to flatten the yield curve as it did in 1962 and 2011.

**Why it matters:** In addition to the technical benefits for the bond market, Operation Twist has historically stimulated the economy by pulling down the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield.

* Because most consumer interest rates ‚Äî like credit cards, auto loans, mortgage rates ‚Äî are set based on the 10-year yield, Operation Twist could act as an accelerant for the economy without the Fed having to add to its balance sheet and risk the appearance of concern.

**Under the surface:** Despite the extraordinarily bullish expectations for booming economic growth in 2021, rate-sensitive sectors of the economy are showing weakness.

* The [housing market has slowed](https://www.axios.com/rising-mortgage-rates-home-sales-2d611246-847d-4691-b21e-e1bc2f4aae79.html) with recent [home sales numbers](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-retreat-2-8-in-january-but-climb-from-last-year) badly missing expectations and CoreLogic's latest [Home Price Insights Report](https://www.corelogic.com/insights/home-price-index.aspx) noting that ""as supply/demand challenges continue to push home prices higher, we may see new barriers for some prospective buyers in 2021.""
* The rate for the traditional 30-year fixed mortgage saw its largest single-week increase in almost a year last week, rising to 3.23%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
* Auto sales are slowing after a [weak 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2021/01/25/auto-sales-bounce-back-in-2021-but-not-all-the-way-prices-stay-high/?sh=33e9d68975c7), with Edmunds.com estimating sales fell 2.8% last month, year over year, due to smaller tax returns and higher car prices and interest rates, Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit, [told](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/03/01/auto-sales-february-2019/3026173002/) the Detroit News.
* Credit card balances and other revolving credit lines fell by 10.8% year over year in December (the last month data were reported) the steepest decline ever, according to the [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G19/current/)'s data.",4,0,1614791194,DQBIII
