8,gqdfhik,"From last GME event, I guess Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab. The three boomer brokerages that everyone recommends in r/personalfinance . Lo and behold are the 3 most trustworthy.

They all have boomer UI though with Vanguard having the most boomer like.

I recommend Fidelity. You can follow the price by having the price open somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Schwab profits from your order flow for stock trades. Fidelity and Vanguard doesn't.

And Fidelity did promise in the near future it will come with its own Robinhood like app (maybe a few months from now).",8,0,1615323639,Fwellimort

10,gqdfon5,"TDA had limitations with GME last time while Schwab didn't. Both are owned by Schwab.

Better to just use its parent brokerage (Schwab) if you are going to stick to Schwab products.",5,0,1615323720,Fwellimort

20,gqdk3b5,"To address point 3. I think that's an interest charge for trading with uncleared funds. You'll see your account drop by a few cents several times a day if you're watching. They're not very open about it, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.",2,0,1615325646,TigreElectrique
21,gqdk8rt,"Schwab has been fine for me. I usually get a discount on my purchases (a few cents or more, but at least I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting gouged). I can trade options. And online (not the app), I can trade during extended hours.",2,0,1615325714,_RayDiggs_

23,gqdl5jn,"They're deposited funds that haven't arrived yet and unsettled funds. A trade takes a few days to settle. So if you're day trading, I think you're techincally trading on margin (there might be a different term, but it is a loan/front).",2,0,1615326121,TigreElectrique

27,gqdmw8j,"To address point 2.  Robinhood makes money by PFOF (payment for order flow). The issue is likely related to that. 

You shouldn't use Robinhood, especially if you're daytrading. The disadvantage in price and speed of your order execution will have a huge impact.",2,0,1615326912,TigreElectrique
28,gqdn48i,Oh I see. Ty for info. I might start keeping hand written logs for my cash balance just Incase or rather switch to another broker,1,0,1615327015,ErectoPeentrounus
29,gqdnarc,Yea speed really matters I‚Äôd say even more than price hence I‚Äôm willing to pay for better execution . I‚Äôd rather pay $1 per contract than lose $20 waiting for an order to execute,2,0,1615327099,ErectoPeentrounus
