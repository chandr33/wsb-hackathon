53,gqifs5h,"I wish I had more shares than I started the day with, but I only figured out the 2nd half of this plan after the attack.

Today I had the trailing stop active to sell, and when it activated when the price fell to $303 I was worried that I would miss my flight to the moon so I immediately went and did a market purchase of the same number of shares at $291.  

If I had the contingent trade active to trigger the 2nd half (the trailing stop to buy) it would have automatically repurchased the shares whenever there was a $5 bounce upwards during that downswing.  

I would have gotten the shares back at a much lower price. And then I'd have a lot more money in hand to buy more shares.

Now I don't know shit about dick, but I did just read [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp) while taking a dump at a holiday inn express.  What the rule says is you can't short on a downtick, so then what's a downtick?  A downtick is when the last transaction on a stock was for a price less than the transaction before it.  

Now for the smooth brain explanation, consider the following order flow:

$1.00  
$1.01  &lt;- You can short here, it ticked UP  
$1.00  &lt;- You cannot short here, it ticked DOWN   
$1.01 &lt;- You can short here now, it ticked UP
