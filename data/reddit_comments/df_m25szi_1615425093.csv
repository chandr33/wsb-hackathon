85,gqjru5k,"

Peterffy said the January event was going to hit the thousands (plural).  Let's go with a conservative $3000.

This current run up looked like a perfect but larger (by about 3 times) replica of January's.  That means the floor of just the retail frenzy/gamma squeeze would make the amount where RH cut off be equivalent to about $1450 on the present chart.

Now if it was going to the thousands then (remember, $3000 conservative estimate), this could easily be a gamma squeeze to $9-10k before the short squeeze even starts. 

If we go by VW standards, the short squeeze could be 400% off the end of the gamma, which would make the floor $40-50k.  And that was only for like 13% shorted.  GME is estimated to be shorted about 250%.

$100k is not a meme, and that is on the conservative side.  $300k is doable.  $500k-1mm might be a meme, but could also be very possible, depending on variables.",1,0,1615449507,Claim_Alternative
