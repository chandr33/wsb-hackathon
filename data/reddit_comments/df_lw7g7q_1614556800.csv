12,gpfp3w1,"I’ve had ongoing problems with TD about the same issue you’re having. They tried to explain to me that it’s because of wash sales, though the equivalent added to my trade price was 300% more than what the wash sales are on cost basis. I have yet to resolve this issue, lots of back-and-forth with them and getting passed around from one rep to another. They’re full of shit 


Edit: the position is not About GME, Though I’m getting screwed over with that one as well but in a different way",1,0,1614706169,nali92
