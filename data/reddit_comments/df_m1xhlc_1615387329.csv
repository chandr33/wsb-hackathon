51,gqg70pl,"I'm just leaving this here because I need to express it somehow.

I am green AF. I opened an investing account a week before the first GME squeeze so I could buy some shares in psilocybin. GME was all over the media, I bought into the hype with 1 share. I realized what a dumb ape move that was, so when it dipped hard, I bought 1 more.

TODAY, for the first time since I opened my account, I'm at a profit. Of $100. On GME. I made an extra $100 on the money I initially invested.

To bigger apes, this is nothing. It's pocket change. But to me, it's a revelation. It's a sign that, if I play my cards right, I *might* be able to afford a house in about 10 years. I might be able to afford to have my parents stay in a guest house on my property and hire a PSW when they need that help, instead of subjecting them to LTC homes. I might actually be able to travel, work remotely and make passive income all at the same time. I might be able to afford fucking *dental.*

BUT...

I'm still not fucking selling.",18,0,1615387339,AnonAMooseTA
