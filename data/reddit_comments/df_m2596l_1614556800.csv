11,gqhc9mm,Lmao Iâ€™ve been holding GME since December and bought in to RBLX a bit too. I know itâ€™s a crazy concept to have more than one position at once.,1,0,1615403645,PapiPalantir

13,gqhcmbg,"I hold other positions too kid. 
But this RBLX nonsense right after 6million shorted shares on GME to mimic a mass sell off is SUS. Its all coordinated. Your either a hedge fund intern cuck or paid shill OR just a retard that like RBLX",0,0,1615403788,LuffyXPat
14,gqhem54,"Your a new level of retarded if you believe that the GME sell off was orchestrated by Roblox. Just because they happed to have their DPO around the time GME was mooning doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s manipulation. RBLX was supposed to go public around Christmas but got delayed. Personally Iâ€™m not all that confident in RBLX for a few reasons, I just bought a few shares to see what happens since this has been something literally everyone was looking forward to before GME blew up. You believe what you want though, thereâ€™ll be plenty more meme plays in the future if you ever decide to buy something other than GME.",1,0,1615404620,PapiPalantir
