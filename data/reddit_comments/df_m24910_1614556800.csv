9,gqh4277,"This is a lot like after the previous initial spike, when it went down and stabilized at an average 50$.

Only this time I believe it will become stable at around 240$ - 250$.
There seems to be a pattern. 

If it goes up too much in a short amount of time it will have to plummet shortly after before becoming stable for a few days. Those rapid spikes are the riskiest moments. 

This probably happens because a lot of people get greedy when they realize they can make a lot of cash after a spike and start selling like crazy, which lowers the stock's value.

But it will never go down too much. Probably in another week it will spike again up to 500$, then plummet again and become stable at around 300$ - 350$.

Or maybe I have no fucking idea what I'm saying because I'm just a retarded ape who has never invested in the stock market before.",1,0,1615400344,RHPL92p
