3,gqcr5ts,$25 is the lowest strike price available - which is pretty much ATM today. CLEAR overreaction. This will print. Thanks for the heads up!,6,0,1615312587,jmaldana7
4,gqcrq59,"Anywhere we can check if insiders sold? This is quite the dump so some bag holder might’ve sold. Not an expert here but it sounds like label issues can be solved by writing more words on labels. Wtf is that issue?

Any other reason I can see the crash is probably due to its release being priced in but the FDA was a swing no paper hand has anticipated

Edit: did some research seems like “labeling” is considered minor and is fixed by straightforward responses. Only bearish thing I can see is that they tried to downplay risk on the medication labeling and got caught. But as I said it doesn’t seem to be that serious unless insiders sold shares. So I’ll prolly wait a few days before buying

10,gqctq8c,"From Wikipedia: 

&gt; On April 29, 2016 Nuplazid (pimavanserin) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.[14][15] The non-binding advisory panel recommendation of 12-to-2 in support of approval that preceded the FDA approval action noted that the drug met an important need, despite its only providing modest benefits and posing serious safety issues.[16]

&gt; On April 9, 2018, CNN reported that some in the FDA were concerned that Nuplazid was ""risky"" when it was approved and noted there have been a substantial number of deaths reported by those using the drug. The story further noted that the drug was approved based on a ""six-week study of about 200 patients"".[18] The FDA began post-market monitoring of the drug to assess the validity of these claims.[19] On September 20, 2018, the FDA stated their review ""did not identify any new or unexpected safety findings with Nuplazid, or findings that are inconsistent with the established safety profile currently described in the drug label"".[20]

I recommend reading the [referenced](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/25/health/fda-nuplazid-safety-evaluation-invs/index.html) [sources](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/09/health/parkinsons-drug-nuplazid-invs/index.html).

It sounds like maybe after reading the new data that was submitted, the FDA found the drug is indeed risky and I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled it altogether.

I am of course speculating based on wikipedia :) I wish you luck!",3,0,1615313731,kbxl

17,gqcxyb3,They're the same thing. The pullback is because they sought approval to treat psychosis in dementia patients (it was so far only approved in parkinson patients). To seek approval they have to show studies where they used the drug in people with dementia.

Agreed.
