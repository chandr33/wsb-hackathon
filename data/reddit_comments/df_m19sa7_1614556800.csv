When you buy stock you are more likely buying from a market maker doing HFT. Market makers will most likely short shares to sell to you, and cover whenever someone wants to sell. Unsurprisingly, short volume is usually roughly 30%-50% of daily volume across most stocks (you can check!).

***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

Mods please don‚Äôt delete :)
I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.
