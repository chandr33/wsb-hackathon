A MOASS would send GME into the high 1000s (as in 4000 or more), if not past 10K. But that's over $500B losses incurred by short-sellers, ie. Probably bankruptcy.

86,gqf4dl8,"This person has a fundamental misunderstanding of DTCC.  
They are a user owned not for profit. That means they are owned by *all* of the brokerages and intermediaries they do business with, which is well over 90% of the trades in the US.  
A not for profit means they don‚Äôt operate to earn a profit, though, unlike a nonprofit they are not exclusively for charity. DTCC is owned by its users, yes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they will prop up Citadel. Why would DTCC use ‚Äútheir‚Äù money (aka every other brokerages‚Äô million/billions in collateral treasury bonds to balance their trades/risk) to bail out *one* brokerage? They wouldn‚Äôt dip into other peoples funds to bail out one idiot.  
So, some trailer parks are user owned. Each person owns their spot and they all pay into a fund for landscaping, taxes, whatever. They actually all pay way less, because there is no middle man taking rent and making a profit. So: user owned, not necessarily a bad thing. To continue with the trailer park analogy, let‚Äôs get creative. Let‚Äôs say  the biggest trailers pay more for their larger spots (bigger brokerages), and the trailer park charges extra per tree (risk) near the trailers. The trailer park charges different amounts based on risk and $$$/value of the trailer. Let‚Äôs also pretend that one of the people who owns a trailer just planted 50 palm trees before hurricane season and they haven‚Äôt watered them (Robinhood). The trailer park steps in and says, hey, your risk just increased a lot. The trees were one thing, but there‚Äôs a hurricane coming now. So, per our user agreement, you have to give us extra money as collateral for the risk you‚Äôve decided to incur. So instead of admitting the trees are dangerous or that they can‚Äôt afford the extra collateral, the trailer owner cuts down half of the trees to minimize their risk and pays for the remaining trees. The trailer park didn‚Äôt *make* that owner cut down the trees. They did it bc they were confronted and asked if they could pay for the damages if they happened and they couldn‚Äôt, so they had to act to minimize their risk so the trailer park would lower their fees.  
Let‚Äôs get back to the real world. Robinhood couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for the margin calls and user‚Äôs shares once the price skyrocketed. DTCC saw they didn‚Äôt have $$ on hand to cover the increased risk. Robinhood couldn‚Äôt pay, obviously, and they WOULD have gone tits up if DTCC didn‚Äôt tell them to become solvent and put up more capital ASAP or be declared insolvent aka bankrupt.  
DTCC is the *only* player in the market that saved Robinhood users tendies. Robinhood was greedy and reckless, DTCC was simply doing their job to ensure market stability.  
Now moving on to OP‚Äôs ridiculous post.   
DTCC does not need to ‚Äúcover their ass‚Äù. They are literally balancing the stock markets risk daily and have been since 1970s, this is one of their main jobs to tell brokerages to put up collateral. No one has heard of DTCC because they *do not* interfere with trading unless the SEC or governing body *explicitly tells them to*. They also only interact with brokerages, never a retail buyer.  
Yes, Robinhood and citadels financial solvency came into question- that‚Äôs why DTCC stepped in!! Again, this was good, as expected, and totally normal. DTCC doesn‚Äôt give a shiny shit if citadel falls. They care of citadel put up enough capital for their trades/risk and they can back up their trades. A brokerage failing is bad for the market. This is why DTCC calls for collateral- to try to ensure they don‚Äôt collapse. But DTCC will not prop up citadel for their own crap.  
To loop back to the trailer park analogy. DTCC bailing out citadel would be like the trailer park bailing out tree guy with every other trailer owners $$ because ... reasons? Because they want tree guy to keep living there? No. Trailer park doesn‚Äôt care about tree guy. Trailer park cares about risk and if tree guy can pay. If he can‚Äôt pay- well bye, someone else will move in tomorrow.",1,0,1615357062,LeMeuf
