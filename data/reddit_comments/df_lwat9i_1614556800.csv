23,gr4fc40,"Wall Streets blatant market manipulation has to face the music, on expiration day across the board. Get in now. Get out a couple bucks from now. This is the way.",1,0,1615903046,GothamOne
24,gr5bbrk,"When I'm holding short I get in and out very quickly. 

AMC could make a sweet swing trade. Better yet, buy shares on the dip, sell a little when it's back up, and then buy again on the next dip, repeat. Add stop losses if you're afraid to lose... but at today's prices, you won't.  

AMC is not a regular stock, this is GME's little brother. This a fight against market manipulators who have been trying to run these companies out of business. Those who hold are going to profit.

If you want to cash in your shares before the fun begins then that's on you, paper hands!

HOLD AND TO THE MOON WE GO!",2,1,1615917479,pscp
