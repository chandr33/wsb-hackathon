 I’m just asking what you meant by “no sales”",1,0,1614893984,tgurnstyle
9,gppae76,"Unfortunately thats no sales for a 3.5 billion company...its growing and maybe at 1 billion or under 10 dollars

11,gppefxm,"You're right that in the short term the financials look bad, but the hope is they become profitable in the next 2-3 years I think. So right now it's a pure speculation play because people don't want to miss out on the next ROKU. This is how speculative growth stonks work.",1,0,1614895862,DingleberryThief
12,gppf5ve,"FUBO is my biggest position so I hope you're right, but I really doubt it. That huge volume was selling volume, as was true of the whole market. Unfortch I think we have a bigger correction looming, in which case these technicals go out the window.

But maybe 6-12 months from now FUBO will break $60. I hope I'm wrong and it's much sooner!",7,0,1614896188,DingleberryThief
