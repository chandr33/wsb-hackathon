4,gpg53vo,"The following is only my opinion - not giving any financial or investing advice:

This company was previously run very poorly, definitely not the case any more. The stock price has been manipulated downward for quite some time now compared to the other players in this space. 

I need to watch what I say so I‚Äôll leave with this. I Bought 6k shares at $1.00 - not selling. Not even close to selling. I wasn‚Äôt close at $24. Even today there seems to be a massive short campaign. It can only work for a little while longer. 

Also - again not giving advice just found this interesting, if a stock has an outstanding order that hasn‚Äôt been filled it cannot be shorted. So if everyone that held a stock were to put in a sell limit order of say $100 for a given stock on a good til cancel basis, it can‚Äôt be shorted and it won‚Äôt be sold until the price of that stock reaches $100 or higher. Imagine what would happen if everyone holding a stock did something like this... food for thought. Only my opinion. Be well friends. üöÄ",2,0,1614713041,c2kreutz

23,gpgtw3f,"Tesla is the only car manufacturer that thinks they can level 5 self drive without LiDAR, at least within the medium term. Every other car manufacturer has second mover advantage and Tesla is dealing with sunk coast.

""bUT iT's noT a CAr cOmpaNY"" only works if they don't write off the camera derived data lake they've built.

Everyone knows Tesla's tech kills people.  Not a moralistic argument about driving deaths from humans vs. robots because Tesla has probably saved 100x more lives than it has taken (insert Joker meme about it all being part of the plan). Cameras have a problem that current computing cannot solve... LiDAR does.

47,gqa59py,"I read that for cars like Teslas that use cameras and computers to analyze the cameras input to determine actions, it costs much less to install a bunch of cameras and run the software. Whereas with LIDAR there are limitations to the capabilities, and it costs a lot more to implement LIDAR sensors into the cars. I understand Microvision has created cheaper LIDAR systems, but it seems that visual-based systems are still superior.
https://towardsdatascience.com/why-tesla-wont-use-lidar-57c325ae2ed5

EDIT: Its not just this-or-that. Teslas use radar and cameras together since cameras suck at seeing shit far away, so the radar takes on the long-distance seeing. LIDAR is gonna be superior to radar in that regard, but again it comes down to a cost analysis - if lidar is more expensive then it makes sense to just keep using radar if there isnt that much of a benefit.

But just because LIDAR isnt the best device to use right now for cars, doesnt mean there isnt an application for this tech. Industries that use LIDAR  include: agriculture, astronomy, agriculture, climate change, land management, land mapping, oil and gas exploration, meteorology, renewable energy, robotics, tsunami warning systems, and I'm sure a bunch of other shit.

48,gqa8h7m,"LIDAR is best for long-range because cameras dont do well for long distance objects. So a combination of radar and cameras are implemented in Teslas, however if LIDAR are now affordable then a combination of LIDAR and cameras would be the ideal pairing.
