13,gphdrjw,"Good luck to you!! Exciting ride for sure.

It's hard to know when great is good enough I found.

I'd sell the options asap. Don't want to be left holding that bag. That's a worse feeling than knowing you could have made more...at least for me. Especially if you're in 4 bagger land.

The stocks I'd take some profit and keep the rest. It is a good company after all.

After this passes. Sell covered calls on the remaining stocks to make some premium over time.

My position before COB today was:

2 $23C 3/5 @ $1.09 = $218

I bought last Friday.

Sold contracts separately today.

1 @ $6.35 (take cost + profit)

1 @ $14.00 - I may have left much on the table, but I have  over $1900 in the que for the next option opportunity.

Good luck to you.",2,0,1614733771,hereforlonghaul
