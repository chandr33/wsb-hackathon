Thank you for writing in. I would love to answer your question.

The DD is out there if you search but I shall give you a quick answer. GME is not a stock, it's a way of life. It follows no Bears or Bulls only Apes here. We have created an entire new pattern for trading - It's called : No pattern and we are Apeish on it.

If you were cool with **buying GME at $100+** ***in January***, then **YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM** ***BUYING GME at $100+ NOW***

***Line of order (losers):*** Melvin &lt; Citadel &lt; DTCC &lt; Gov't &lt; Global Economic Collapse

This is ***TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS***

THINK PPL

IF WE'RE SAYING TO **THE MOON** ETC (As for me, I'm thinking more ***intergalactic travel***)

THIS STUFF IS LIKE ***TRILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY***

LETS BE ON OUR:

STAR TREK

STAR WARS

ETC

BUY HODOR

**FOR THE SQUEEZE:**

***Limit Sell Order: $999,999.99***

As of now we‚Äôre all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you‚Äôre unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you‚Äôre concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!

$999,999.99

Let‚Äôs ALL get THE BEST PRICE!

From there click sell and boom, you are done. Then you will see your money in your buying power. Remember that it counts as a day trade if you bought today and sold today. It will let you do 3 and if you do a 4th it will automatically kick you into a cash only account (No instant credit) and you will never be able to undo it (Or so I've read).
