15,gqb5pbv,"Just because you say ""This is not advice"" doesn't mean you aren't directly telling people advice of what the fuck to do with their money. 

Keep in your own lane and tell people what YOU plan to do. If YOU are too much of a paper hands bitch to dump more in then it doesn't mean everyone else is. 

I personally am not gonna average up on GME. I spent all the money I am willing to lose in anticipation of the stimmy checks 2 weeks ago. That was my choice. If people are willing to throw their entire stimmy checks away and possibly lose absolutely everything by betting on GME going to the moon. that is their business.",1,0,1615280326,Ditto_D

second of all DFV didn't sell when it was $400 and buy back when it was $40, he did buy MORE at 40 but he didn't sell his 50k shares when he could have bought 10x more by doing just that. HE HELD.

68,gqcuy6l,"The purpose of stimulus money is for it to be spent in the economy. That‚Äôs the fucking purpose of the money. So you spend it at a business, so that business can pay employees and can stay open, meaning those employees and owner have money to spend. 

Don‚Äôt tell someone who understands how stimulus spending is designed to work to ‚Äústay in your lane.‚Äù 

I know merka tells you that individual behavior is somehow siloed so it doesn‚Äôt impact anyone else, buts that‚Äôs political nonsense you swallowed and isn‚Äôt based in reality. If people don‚Äôt spend the money the stimulus bill doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs supposed to.

70,gqdipsf,"1.	Profits from the stock market aren‚Äôt guaranteed and the money doesn‚Äôt need to be spent when you cash out, it needs to be spent now. Again, you lack an understanding of stimulus spending and the ‚Äújacked to the tits‚Äù Gosling bravado doesn‚Äôt guarantee you cash out in the positive.
2.	There‚Äôs no reading comprehension issues in anything I said. Though your assertion I think this is ‚Äúfree money‚Äù and not government funds from tax payers kinda makes me think you have the reading comprehension problem. Easier to construct strawmen when you lack and argument, huh?
3.	Absolutely did not say this was free money. Of course it‚Äôs government funds collected from taxes. I do not understand why Americans point this out like people are unaware where government funds come from. That it‚Äôs ‚Äúyour taxes‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anyone who makes a bad argument is automatically correct. People paying taxes doesn‚Äôt magically make them knowledgeable about government monetary policy. 
4.	Rent, another much better use of stimulus funds than investment/savings/debt repayment. Rent money keeps people in their homes. It also filters back into the economy faster than investments/savings/etc.",1,0,1615325039,joecan

1. Take your dumb shit and go see my first comment in this chain.

2. See 1 for proof you have shit reading comprehension. 

3. Don't care

4. Arguing about how to inject the money back into the market and which is ""better"" is dumb as shit. Everyone getting a stimmy check will be making under 180K per family. Most of these checks are going right back into the economy by repaying credit card bills they racked up in the pandemic, paying rent/mortgage, or buying shit. So most likely these stimmy checks are going directly into a bank or you small home town business WALMART so they can take that and pay their employees near minimum wage for 29.5 hours a week so they don't have to give them benefits, get a tax write off for some worker charity program nearly no one gets, and then double dips on their workers suffering by them being on food stamps or snap to afford groceries.
