10,gqh00pd,If halting is based on a numerical analysis based on how high or low it goes in so many seconds how come it didn’t halt when it was rising only when it fell? It went up quite a bit in a short bit of time; one could argue it went down faster but still not sure it makes since.,5,0,1615398855,Idontcare0408

And then boom, they've been building ammo for days for one coordinated attack to capture limit sells and paper hands. 

This CONFIRMS everything. They're majorly fucked. Why throw 700k short shares in one major attack if they were feeling good?
