18,gppuwa9,"Last Friday had way more calls in the money heading into the morning. There was a share dump on Friday, a bunch of those calls fell out of the money and could have contributed to a little negative gamma squeeze. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see a big squeeze on the shares without an unexpected spike in price, like what happened with CFO news to get the price up again. If there is no unexpected jump, there is no rush to cover. If the price stays flat, the calls are covered and there is no rush to fill. If the price drops, you will see it fall fast like last week. A squeeze has to involve something unexpected, the funds won‚Äôt just watch it squeeze, they‚Äôll make sure it closes a little lower.",2,0,1614903936,red_cap_and_speedo

30,gppv62q,"Theoretically, could people that have low strike value calls, sell those and buy other calls, still ITM, but at a higher strike price, so they would then have more calls, thereby pushing the demand higher?  For instance, say I have 8 calls at strike 45, with a cost of 80 per.  I sell all those, and then buy 16 calls at a strike of 100, for 40 per.  Note, these numbers I just made up, but you get the idea.  Would this not then increase the amount of calls ITM exponentially?",1,0,1614904074,Lorien6

40,gppve6e,And that's part of what's driving the price up. And then people keep buying more shares as it becomes bullish. Then more options become ITM. Not saying it will spike tomorrow. But there are more ITM contracts today then there were yesterday. And they maybe didn't anticipate GME hitting 140 and closing at 135 today when planning to cover,8,0,1614904188,fioreman
