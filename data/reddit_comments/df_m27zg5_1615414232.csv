95,gqi14ff,Yes. Short just means they borrow shares (probably ours) and sell a bunch at once. That causes prices to fall. Their initial cost is only the borrow fee (could be as low as 2% a year).

97,gqi14nu,"Basically one of my neighbours has a bunch of chickens. One I've noticed walking around the street a few times this week.

Today it was in my sisters back garden. She called me to remove it because she was scared her dog would attack it.
I went over and saw it sitting on the seat of a bike so I tried to grab it slowly to not scare it.

I think it sensed my fear and decided it wanted me to bleed so it just make a loud ""BAKAWK"" sound and flipped the fuck out. It was jumping around all over the place and pecking/clawing at me. 

I naturally freaked out and ran towards my sisters door only to find her son LOCKED IT after he saw the chicken go crazy.
He's scared of literally every animal and for some reason thought it would break in and kill him or something stupid.


Now I didnt just slowly stroll to the door and turn the handle to find out its locked but I sprinted towards it, turned the handle and then slammed my head into it in my panic. 

I decide to just jump the fence and get into my own house to get towel. I manage to catch the chicken with the towel and drop it off at the owners house.


I fear that one day it will return to finish me off.
