Also heard scuttlebutt that Saudi Aramco is looking to get listed in the NYSE. It makes sense for them to drive up price before their listing.

20,gqa6ra4,"tl;dr -- China tech weakness is temporary but I would wait for a proper bottom before buying back in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Def temporary. China tech is getting hit by the triple whammy of high valuations, sector rotation, and new regulation.

As I am sure you know, valuations fluctuate and sector rotations are cyclical. Regulations, however, are a different beast. Unlike in the US / Europe, when things are regulated in China they can be draconian. A tech company would have little recourse in China should the CCP decide to break up an actual (or perceived) monopoly, and the speed with which it would be done would astonish westerners used to due process of law. That said, the CCP is anything but stupid. They know that anything deemed overtly heavy-handed or unfair would hurt their aspirations to be the dominant world power.

Personally, I find it to be very unlikely that China will overstep appropriate regulations and, as far as I know from my research, the regulations are well-thought-out given the risks involved, particularly for FINTECH.
