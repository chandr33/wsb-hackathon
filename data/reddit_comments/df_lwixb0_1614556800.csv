51,gphxp7f,"  RKT at $40 is still very cheap. P/E of 10.

Great revenue, great profits they have been producing every quarter.

(EPS last 3 quarters - $1.42(Q2), $1.21(Q3) and $1.14(Q4-2020). If you take approx $4 earning per year. that makes 10 P/E)

Bank of America - P/E 19

JP Morgan - P/E 17.

Stock is undervalued with short interest of 45%. Only 108 million shares outstanding (available to trade). 48 Million shares Short !!

Today's volume was 351 Million. !!

This will go higher...much higher... to the Moon.

I believe $70-80 is a fair price ( even without a short squeeze)

And.. RKT is paying $1.1 dividends, also doing a big stock buy back.

&amp;#x200B;

Again.. 45% short interest in RKT

only 24% short interest in GME !!",-5,0,1614744127,SmPatriot
