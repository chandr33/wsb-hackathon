5,gqh47ta,All you jamokes talk about short ladder attacks but do you even have proof of this?,0,0,1615400407,DomitianF
6,gqh4l74,It's probably because it violates the rules or is shit. There are plenty that are making it through snowflake.,-3,0,1615400553,The_Three_Nuts
7,gqh4w6d,Oh I didn't know you were educated on this. Can you explain why it is NOT a ladder attack?,0,0,1615400674,MyPandaAssassin
8,gqh5512,"The fact that you're calling me a snowflake, I can hit the ignore button now lol. Only self centered, egotistical people refer to others as snowflakes when they want to try and make fun of them but don't know how. Bye buddy, hope you find your dad.",3,0,1615400768,MyPandaAssassin

10,gqha4gb,"Do you have proof that God DOESNT EXIST? Maybe it was an alien attack! Stop making shit up without proof, its misleading.",0,0,1615402752,DomitianF
11,gqhb6e1,So encouraging people to keep holding so they don't panic sell is misleading. Bro pick your side. If you believe in this group then quit attacking posts that support the group.,0,0,1615403192,MyPandaAssassin
12,gqhczsr,Pumping up delusions is not supporting the group. You are providing untrue information that can mislead people into making decisions with real consequences.  Be honest and present honest information otherwise you give more ammo to outlets like CNBC to trash us. You are the problem.,0,0,1615403946,DomitianF
13,gqhji1h,"Bro fuck off lol. You're the problem. You're on here discouraging help when there was a 1.5 mil dump that was all in ladder form of multiple shares being sold at the same exact amount in succession. You want proof, then go find it. I'm not your source and I'm not claiming to be the source. Im giving people hope unlike CNBC that only cares about themselves and their ratings. If you don't believe me, then go find the answers while I sit here and actually help people and keep them going instead of panic selling. None of this is financial advise so if you're not gonna be a retard with us, then don't participate. Byyyyyyyye",0,0,1615406698,MyPandaAssassin
14,gqhjs5p,"Byyyyye? What are you, 16?  I shouldnt have to research and idea youte bringing up but cant back up. You're basically admitting that you cant back up this bullshit you're peddling. I'm not discouraging people from buying the stock, I'm advocating that you provide real information and to stop making shit up to pump a stock.",0,0,1615406820,DomitianF
15,gqhkucf,Why do I need to specifically show YOU? EVERYONE else who doesn't believe it has already researched it themselves. You're obviously looking for a way to be right about this conversation by nit picking each thing about it instead of looking it up yourself to even see. I don't need to show you proof because if you NEED proof about this then you're just relying on other people to give you the right info instead of being independent. Cause I have yet to see you disprove that it was a ladder attack. You keep asking me to prove it was but not providing evidence yourself that it wasn't. If you want to go on a merry go round then just fucken say so.,0,0,1615407280,MyPandaAssassin
16,gqhl9z4,"My guy, I'm not saying provide it to me alone, I'm saying provide proof for everyone. Its beneficial for the community if you provide proof that everyone can use.  You're like a religious person asking to provide proof that God doesnt exist. It's a weak argument and you look ignorant.",0,0,1615407467,DomitianF
17,gqhna2p,"If that's how you feel bro then you do you. There were PLENTY of people providing pictures while it was happening of the multiple orders being placed in succession at the same exact time. MODS were also deleting any kind of photo while this was happening to so if you didn't grab it before the mods deleted shit.....I don't know what to tell you bro. That's where I got the info and the group convo in that feed. I could be right and I easily could be wrong but the thing that isn't wrong is encouraging people to not panic sell so because it doesn't matter what it was. There was a large dip from multiple orders at the same exact time in succession (ladder) and it wasn't done by us so keep holding so we can keep it going. THAT should be the focus, not what info is right or wrong. That shit doesn't even matter in this situation bro. Lol we're arguing over formalities, that's why this conversation is a merry go round cause it just goes in circles.",0,0,1615408326,MyPandaAssassin
