7,gqdche2,Amc is a safer bet in my opinion. Even without a squeeze you could double your money this summer. Not financial advice. AMD I eat crayons,7,0,1615322325,seifer-almasy90

15,gqdd7qd,"You should use that money to buy Meet Kevin’s courses on stocks and the psychology of the market. Then apply what you learn.
