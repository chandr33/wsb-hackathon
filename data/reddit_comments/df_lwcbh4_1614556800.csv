3,gpgja31,"Agreed, even when it was tanking and dropping people were posting pics of their gains (Previous) to encourage others to build up the price. 

Screenshots should be at least within the last few hours but people will do what ever they can to help increase stock prices.",1,0,1614719091,YYCIRE
4,gpgjyry,"Hmmm donâ€™t be rash with selling unless itâ€™s for a profit in my opinion.  There is a lot going on in companies daily so get to the research before selling if you already purchased and buying if you are planning on getting anything else.  You can have riskier stocks in your portfolio just donâ€™t put all your marbles into many of them.  Sometimes you have to wait it out a long time to see profits.   At least I hope that I am not wrong. I made the mistake of getting distracted last squeeze and buying into too many to the moon stocks.  Then all the pausing that went on in many companies messed me up.  One or two and hold.  Diversity with stable, dividend paying ones.  I am not an advisor but am hopeful that GME and amc will be successful eventually maybe sooner.ðŸ¤ž. Also look into averaging down if the stocks drop in price and see if that is profitable for you in the long run.  I am still learning just noticed too many people here are bringing up new stocks and perhaps we are not yet done with these.  Not an advisor just my opinion.",1,0,1614719387,Tyna03
