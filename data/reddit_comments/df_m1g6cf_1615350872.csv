I mean he is taking in well over a million a year on YouTube so it doesn‚Äôt even matter if his tenants start covid squatting or his houses sit empty. 

Same for his stock portfolio. But it keeps on a tear and everyone is a genius in a bull market. 

I still watch him and find his style of media highly helpful since he basically scours and reads stuff all day flipping back and forth. I can watch him at 2x speed to catch up on relevant financial news but I wish he wouldn‚Äôt make so many ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù",1,0,1615350985,zoopboop-111
