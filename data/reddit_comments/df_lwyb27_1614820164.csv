4,gplp4wp,This is so true! How many times have we said that we don't understand why these company tank on the market when we get in our car and drive to them.....we want them to stay!!! Why is it up to Wall Street short sellers and hedgies to decide what company to kill and force many out of a job? Seems to me they're doing the same thing to Tesla right now.....they're shorting it because the short sellers/hedgies are mad at Elon for siding with WSB (my opinion). Unleashed power!
