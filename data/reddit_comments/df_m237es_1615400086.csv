22,gqh3e0z,"My dearest Emma,

Yesterday afternoon several hedgies visited our camp in search of ‚Äúshares‚Äù but had to turn them away empty handed although we had as many as sixty nine or four hundred twenty ¬†with us. Several joined us yesterday from Europe‚Ä¶.This morning as we passed along I noticed a woman standing in the door with two future degenerate looking children by her side and a little one in her arms. I thought she looked very sad, and watched her, when pretty soon she began to cry. Others noticed it and asked the cause of her trouble. She replied with sobs and tears stifled as well as she could, that her mister was pressed in the hedgies army and she feared that he was wiped out of shares during the battle of Robinhood. Poor woman!

Most of the inhabitants‚Äîwho, by the way, appear to be mostly normies, the retards and autists having joined the mobile phone infantry‚Äîview us in dogged silence as we pass them, the younger ones occasionally hurrahing for the Hedge Fund Confederacy and looking daggers at us. Since leaving practical advise behind we have seen but one avowed degenerate family. The old man stood by the roadside swinging his hat and speaking words of encouragement, while his noble looking wife waved a freshly fried tendie, the little children, full of animation, hurrahing for the Union of Degenerates, and one little girl stood by with an apron full of tendies throwing them beneath our feet. We pass hedgie taunts without notice, but Union of Degenerates demonstrations bring out loud cheers as we passed that one little, devoted, retarded family‚Ä¶.

Yours as ever,
