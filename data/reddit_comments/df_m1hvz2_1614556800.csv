Sell the put when the price drops Thursday.

20,gqdwvci,"Well amc has always been considered to be gme little bro. It‚Äôs not gonna look like gme at all. Sure there is still a really good chance for a squeeze still but I think if we do see a squeeze it‚Äôll max out at like $100. This is me guessing I don‚Äôt know shit. But I think the play here isn‚Äôt expecting it to hit more than $100. I hope it does but if we don‚Äôt see a squeeze at all it‚Äôs still considered a good long term hold. 

You‚Äôll hopefully win if it squeezes or not. Hopefully it settles around the $20-$30 mark later this summer or potentially next year if covid is walking out the door. If we see another wave of covid we could be holding the bag longer than we‚Äôd like.",1,0,1615331689,Legendary__Beaver

35,gqeb235,"The real crux is it really doesn't matter what the Short Interest is on AMC or UWMC. It really doesn't. 

A few weeks ago a lot of people here were mocking GME posts saying they were desperate bag holders and the Short Interest fell so much, it was a bad play..

And yet here we are. 

It's because we have a lot of eyes on us and they want to play too.

 If WSB can agree on a single stock to attack after GME, we can have a sequel. But they have to agree on which stock to single out...whether it's AMC, UWMC or something else.",2,0,1615339146,CadderlySoaring
