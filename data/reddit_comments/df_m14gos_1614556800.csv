21,gqbfj4v,"It’s got a lot of things in its favor. The same things that drove it in January are still there. Short shenanigans, failures to deliver, probable naked shorts. 

The CEO of Interactive Brokers slipped and said it was headed into the thousands before the RH bullshit. Thousands, plural. 

On top of that, we have fundamentals getting stronger and stronger making it attractive beyond that. It’s no longer a short term squeeze only. There’s also a strong drive to go long in this.
