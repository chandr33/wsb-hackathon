37,gqh9ef0,"Alright, ENOUGH ALREADY, I can‚Äôt hear any more of the nonsense that goes on in this sub regarding the role of HFTs and market makers in this. Every time the price of GME drops sharply, people drop the term MM or HFT and pin the blame on these guys. 

I‚Äôm not going to do a full DD on MM and HFT but the two are closely related and 99% of the time they act as the same thing. The only thing I will stress and hope some of you will take away from this is: the market makers (and HFT are considered a MM in this regard) couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck where GME stock goes, it literally matters fuckall to them if it‚Äôs trading at $5 or at $5,000, okay? These two prices are identical for all they care, as long as they bring the same volume of two-sided order flow - which is all they care about. Why? Because the volume of order flow is what determines if they make money or not, the actual price - doesn‚Äôt. 

WHEN YOU SEE THE PRICE DROPPING, ITS BECAUSE THE MM WANTS YOU GUYS TO BUY.
It‚Äôs because you guys didn‚Äôt send the MM enough buy orders at the higher price, but sellers did send their sell orders, and the MM dropped the quote in search for a price low enough to curb out sellers and reignite buyers to jump in. 
It‚Äôs NOT because they ‚Äúwanted to help the shorties‚Äù. What the fuck does the MM care if he makes the spread at $5 or at $10, or at $1,000?",-16,0,1615402459,JRyefield
