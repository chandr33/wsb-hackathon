27,gpl920v,"Gun sales are always up under a democratic president.

That said; gun/ammo sales were very up last year of trump; and anyone who tried to buy ammo knows how awful it was.
Speculating; but lots of this was new liberal gun owners. Lots of sales were first time buyers. Trump's crowd, especially people like the capital crowd, already had guns if that's what you're thinking(but usually gun nuts continue to buy).

Also, Covid fear. Covid had lots of people worried about getting their basic household goods.

Also BLM fear. I think it's dumb 99% white neighborhoods think they're going to be invaded; but it pushes gun sales.

A Dem president will cause gun sales. But gun sales are always up pre-presidential election.

I'd love to get some 20cpr 9mm myself again. But, personally, I just don't see the hype being there. Ammo/gun are already V high because of all the fear stuff + shortages from covid hitting supply.
I don't think Biden is going to go hard after guns; he's got way more popular policies to go for, and he is very much a centerist.

People could go out and do gun sports during covid. You think people stopped hunting or going to the range for covid? Being allowed in movie theaters doesn't equal more gun sales.

I don't think you should start buying puts. I just don't think gun/ammo is secretly undervalued. It's already pretty high. And, it can have some serious lulls if things get quiet nationally for awhile. The only situation where I see them rocketing is another economic crisis; and that's a whole other can of worms.",14,0,1614812259,TechnicianPlenty

45,gpltlkv,"Because the stock rose faster than market makers predicted. The same thing happened with RKT, it takes MMs a while to create a set of option strikes, and say for example the set of March 19th strikes that they released only went up to $30 because at the time, that was 100% (example) out of the money. But now we are reaching the top of the March 19th strikes with 16 days left... so a delta ramp can happen where the majority of strikes in the chain are ITM, and they approach 1 delta the closer they get to expiration.

Delta of 1 means for every 1 share you buy MMs must hedge 1 share. So for example, one call contract with a delta of 0.5 (the 3/19 $25c) would force MMs to buy 50 (0.5 \* 100) shares of the underlying... yes, you read that right - for $200 (cost of the contract premium) you apply $1250 ($25 \* 50 shares) worth of upward pressure on the stock.

Because market makers are constantly buying shares to hedge against your calls, this drives the price up even further, which brings more strikes ITM and makes their delta values start increasing as well, hence the 'ramp'. I will also add that shorts get royally owned in this scenario as their puts are reduced to ashes when the entire chain goes OTM - they risk losing their entire position if they don't capitulate and sell.

The second RKT broke the top of the chain at $36, it was lift off time. When this happens, that call is the cheapest call anyone can possibly buy and there's a massive increase in price because of basic supply and demand in the options market. Then, you will see that market makers update the options chain in a day or two and the price settles back down. The pent up demand is wiped out when you can suddenly buy and sell $65 calls. That's why RKT went up and that's why RKT is going down (and probably won't come back up again - they updated the options chains for every expiration because of this debacle). It's also why ASO could be the next RKT, it meets all of the same conditions.

!!Bear case alert!!

Float is 100M shares, open interest is roughly 1M shares in calls, or less than 1% of the float. Theoretically a big institutional investor could crush any upward movement by selling tons of shares. Though I don't understand why they wouldn't just hop on the rocket as well to the chagrin of short sellers. More good news is, if a bunch of apes pile on that open interest is going to increase. We need all hands on deck for this work.",12,1,1614823212,NinjaRocksBreakGlass
