EVENTUALLY, the shorts have to buy to close. the limiting thing here is that until they do, they are paying interest. at some point, the cost of interest payments will exceed their tolerance, and they will be forced to do something about it. they are trying like hell to get the price low enough to have a decent exit, but it's just not gonna fuckin happen... at least it doesn't look like it will. price has become exceptionally volatile because of how many people are just holding their shares, so what volume there is is causing it to swing like crazy.",7,0,1615398965,BreezyWrigley
