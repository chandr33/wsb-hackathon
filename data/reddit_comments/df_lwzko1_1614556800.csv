9,gpk3id8,"GSAT is not the play.

MMATF (or META post-merger), just partnered with Sikesu who focuses on 5G/6G Infrastructure. This solves a problem that Elon Musk's ""Starlink"" currently has. Not saying he'll be interested in the technology, but if he is then you might want to pick up some MMATF shares. I am not a cat. I am not a financial advisor.",1,0,1614794034,BagboyBrown

17,gpk5ii1,"Listen to what I said. META just partnered with Sekisu. META. That's Metamaterials. The company merging with TRCH on Mar 12. The company that shares an incubation site at Inovacorp with Tesla. Elon has a (currently) private company named Starlink who launches low-orbit satellites, but the issue with them is they cannot utilize the current 4G infrastructure due do their distance.

Sekisu could solve this issue for Starlink, who will also be going public next year (speculation, we only know it will not be this year). But if you think GSAT is the play, it's your money. Also, if you're not familiar with Metamaterials, they already have projects Elon could be interested in for his automobiles.",3,0,1614794892,BagboyBrown
