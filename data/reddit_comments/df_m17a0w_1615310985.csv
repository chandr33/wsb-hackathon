61,gqcydf6,"I don't want to be that guy, but ... pros and cons:

Bullish: The whole sector is undervalued. They're trying to beat Rocket. They are utterly committed to the wholesale philosophy. They pay a good, attractive dividend. 

Bearish: Why would anyone touch a mortgage originator right now? People just refinanced at historic lows -- self included. I just refinanced at 2.25% for 15 years. It'll be a -while- before these companies see the kind of revenue they saw in 2020. They're also allowed to count a locked (but not closed) loan as income. That's a lot like Target counting any item you pick up in the store while shopping as a sold item regardless of whether you actually buy it or put it back on the shelf. (put the ice cream back in the canned food areas like monsters you are). Literally every indicator around says sell.
