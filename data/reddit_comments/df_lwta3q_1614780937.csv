I have had multiple Reddit accounts so my account page does not reflect it, but have been around since before the *WSB God* ordeal. Just started investing once I finally got out of debt and came to the conclusion that losing money would not negatively affect me.

That being said, I must say that people seem to be blind to the fact that a **7 million** user gain in **any** community within a short period of time Will of course bring with it some Baggins, especially a community that is solely focused on the acquisition of money. When money gets involved, things are messy. When the idea of major amount of free money and literally millions of people get involved all within a very short period of time, things get pretty fucky. 

There are actually websites in businesses that are now built around the monitoring of this community. People with millions of dollars in billions of dollars with big power or now watching this with the intent of exploiting it. Just think of how easy it is to hire say 50,000 bots that go unnoticed in a monumental number like 9 million. Do people seriously think that things are not being manipulated?

Especially with the fact that the entire feel of the sub has changed, I don‚Äôt know, I just feel like something is off. I cannot tell you how many ‚Äúabsolutely certain predictions‚Äú have been made with pages full of research that say X stock (GME) or some other is going ‚Äúto the mooooooon‚Äù. Do you fucking retards actually think that GameStop is going to hit $100,000 a share? $10,000 a share? Be serious. That is fucking moronic. Lots of people are spewing this shit seriously and lots of people are also buying it up.

**I‚Äôve said this before and I seem to get down voted, but I don‚Äôt really care. This sub should reset it‚Äôs users back to people who have subscribed before February 1, and then go private.** 

That will at least help with the majority of things and get things back to normal. What benefit is there to have 9 million subscribers? What about 5 million? Honestly, some of the best DD and research that I have seen is being done in other established sub Reddit‚Äòs that are similar to Wall Street bats but with a much lower subscriber count. I will not name them, because I also don‚Äôt want them to blow up like this one has and become ruined.
