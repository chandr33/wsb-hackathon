3,gqfqmst,"I’m staying away but good luck to everyone going in.

My concerns:

-	their primary source of revenue is selling virtual currency but the store is dominated by scammers and shitty content with very little effort to curate or quality control the store
-	I fear major security issues around an app targeted at young children, even used in schools, since a scary man grooming kids could be a scandal that absolutely kills the thing
-	I don’t see a strong bull case, surely it won’t grow faster in 2021 and 2022 than 2020 with the kids all locked inside
-	their developer tools are actually shit and this has and will restrain content creators adopting it
-	they used to run these cool in game events but now they just lean on the content creators to seasonally theme. They do this but it makes for a fairly incoherent event and occasion system

12,gqfrdwg,"Yeah I mean, being fair you could have made similar or even stronger criticisms of Minecraft which saw users spin up their own servers and often post the details on Reddit and 4chan and MC didn’t blow up, but the indie and distributed nature of MC was almost an immunity against this since it really empowered the users to take the risk they wanted for themselves and the blowback wouldn’t go to Mojang. 

But it’s telling that when Microsoft bought MC they really locked that shit down. You still can run your own server of course but they push users to their realms thing and the kids are just as happy playing in that much more controlled environment and also for education they made a special version of MC which empowers the schools and which more or less handles the security for the schools.

Roblox *could* fix these issues, none of them are insurmountable and actually they are easy enough to solve from a technical point of view, but it requires prioritizing security and quality over revenue and I have never seen Roblox prioritize anything over revenue. It’s not in their dna.",1,0,1615378113,monkestronke

If your platform allows you to buy shares at offering I'd consider throwing a chunk of play money at it with the sole intention of flipping it for a profit by EOD.  Then I'd watch for a few days/weeks depending on volatility to see where it is actually going before I considered it an investment.  Offerings can be juicy though, not uncommon for them to shoot up 20 or 30% by the afternoon of the first day as FOMO takes over.",1,0,1615378383,chiefoogabooga

I liken it to a lego person looking version of mine craft which she also plays.

28,gqfth00,"Allow me to be the angel's advocate. I've been playing Roblox for a decade, it just isn't one of those platforms where lewdness finds you unless you're looking for it, most kids are too distracted trying to find some neon horse to talk to the candy van man, and I've never encountered predation other than exploiters trolling for shits and giggles.

Scamming has become impossibly difficult to do because Roblox has realized how insanely lazy their moderation is and has essentially frozen live Robux (their currency) transactions for 5-14 days to verify bolus/bulk transactions. 

There's an active development forum that has tried to help improve it's application. What you think of those developer tools is all subjective but the games have really come a long way, just shows you how well they've been keeping up with times.

Holiday items will still be handed-out as freebies in contrast to obtaining them in official Staff games, yes, in-game incentives have really had carry over as popularity changes, it's really no surprise they've chose this method it's been survival of the fittest but it's all because top developers have been making 6 figures for a couple years now.

47,gqg2ynm,"My main play is GME, but I set aside some money for this too. Here's my 2 cents and why I'll probably buy a bit at open and see what happens:

\-Roblox is not new and has been around for like 15 years, my kids all play the shit out of it and as far as I can tell its more popular than ever. They literally ASK daily what chores they can do to get measly amounts of Robux(in game currency), its like crack or pokemon cards these days.

\-Roblox has invested heavily in their infrastructure to address the exact cyber-stalking concerns that have been listed by some here. This negatively impacts their bottom line in the short run, making it look like they lost money this year, but its pretty clear that money was put back into the company, not wasted and not lost.

\-Roblox is not going to ""go away"" once the pandemic subsides. People act like the only reason kids play video games is because they were locked up but that has never, and will never be the case. Their future growth may not look as explosive as 2020 but that doesn't mean they wont grow at all.

\-Roblox may not look profitable but that is because I've seen almost no one take into account their net bookings. Their net bookings as per their S1 was 1.24 BILLION dollars. They use an in game currency that users pay real money for, but Roblox cant report that money as income until the in game user actually spends that money. So their ""net bookings"" means they literally took in 1.24 billion dollars in cash as payment for their in game currency, and the difference between their net bookings and actual profit looks the way that it does because not every user spends every Robux( in game currency) right away, sometimes they load up and the robux sits in their account until they see something in game that they want to buy. Once they spend it, then Roblox can report that as earnings. This lends to steady cash flow quarter over quarter as those net bookings become realized profits. 

\-I read a great post from an actual Roblox developer yesterday who showcased some of the game engine's potential so saying that this is a ""shitty game"" is not real research. The game is blocky and basic at times yes, but so is minecraft and look what happened there. Roblox is extremely versatile and from what I saw from the developers post, game improvements are coming and will make for a hell of an in game experience.

\-And finally, just like with so many other stocks here, this one has some hype and that always counts for something. I'm not saying this is going to be a long term investment for me, but as I always say(and others have said it too) this is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreetGuaranteedProfits.
