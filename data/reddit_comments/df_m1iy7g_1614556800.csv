8,gqdwq0p,"No need to be so patronising. 

I thought you were talking about the billboards with just ‚Äúüíéüôåü¶ç‚Äù on them, didn‚Äôt realise people had bought proper ones advertising the company.",1,0,1615331616,CompetitiveAngle4811
9,gqdwsjq,"Unfortunately, shortages on consoles may stretch a lot of the next gen sales into the next quarter. But yeah, should be the first of a few good ERs. So of course the price will drop right after.",1,0,1615331651,Turokk8001

14,gqdxyjv,NPD data shows that stock for consoles in the holiday quarter was 1:1 with the PS4 &amp; XBO launch. The big difference was that demand was much higher &amp; that allowed them to sell a lot of forced bundles. Expect the holiday quarter to be more than the last console launch.,3,0,1615332246,Original-Baki
15,gqe0fov,"I stand corrected, I did not realize the console inventory was 1:1 when compared to last launch. 

I can also say that I am one of those that bought a forced bundle from GS just because I wanted the console and I wanted to buy it from them.",1,0,1615333523,Turokk8001
16,gqe1hch,Haha no worries. I‚Äôm a bit of a geek when it comes to gaming industry. Record dollar sales for the console industry last quarter. GME will have a very good quarter.,1,0,1615334068,Original-Baki
