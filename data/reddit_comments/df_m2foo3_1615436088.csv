1,gqj6cvr,"No.  Stop losses are bad in that you released your shares into the open market, and the shorted HFs can scoop up your shares and cover their shorts.  The idea is to choke them so the float is NOT available to them.",1,0,1615436182,bluecoaster1

14,gqj8bwz,"If you need money for something important, you don‚Äôt set a stop loss, you sell. You also don‚Äôt invest money that you don‚Äôt have. 

Funny that you call it bs, when that‚Äôs the legit scenario. 

Telling people to set stop losses, saying you need it for 4 medical procedures, then calling it out as conspiracy. I‚Äôve never called anyone a shill, but you sir, may just be one",2,0,1615437401,fatedMercy

17,gqj8o8r,"&gt;Why can‚Äôt we apply that same idea algorithm to multiple PCs(and hardware) to look at that real-time data and make/buy positions?

Because you're too slow. You're too far from the servers. You have to go through brokerages and market-makers. There are so many reasons.

We're talking about firms trying to get an edge in their order milliseconds ahead of competitors by being physically closer to the servers so their orders go through shorter fiber optics cables.

So you're talking about receiving market data, distributing processing tasks to the rest of the cluster around the world, having their slow-ass computers crunch the numbers, sending the results back, recompiling them together, then sending in your order. By the time you received the market data 10 competing algo firms have already made their money.

Also, beyond high frequency trading, ***lots*** of people use programs to trade for them on a much longer timescale. You can set up your own automated orders, or interface with your broker's API and write your own program, etc. See /r/algotrading. You don't need a computing cluster - your desktop does just fine.

And you, as an individual, absolutely have access to the order book - it's called level 2 market data. You just have to pay your brokerage.",6,0,1615437615,imamydesk
