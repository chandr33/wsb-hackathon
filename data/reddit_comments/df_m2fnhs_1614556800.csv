2,gqiw3tx,"1.) Short selling doesn’t put good businesses under. 2.) Your pensions might have 2-3% max in hedge funds. 3.) yes -50% in 10 minutes is normal, just like when this went from ~45 to $175 a few weeks ago on the ice cream tweet, this isn’t trading rationally. 4.) thus far no hedge funds have gone out of business.

Stop it. Invest because you like the stock but this isn’t some social movement",-6,0,1615430271,BagofBabbish

10,gqiyei8,I made my point. This stock is trading irrationally in both directions. I’m sorry you don’t like the answer,0,0,1615431504,BagofBabbish
11,gqiylaf,"Ha exactly. Stock drops 50% and everyone screams mAnIPuLatiOn. Stock goes from $40 to $170 to $340 on a tweet and vapors and “this is totally normal and rational,”",2,0,1615431605,Verb0182
12,gqiyqr0,"*says stock dropping 50% in 10 minutes is normal*

Proof?

13,gqwmf33,"This stock isn't trading rationally. I'm sorry, but it's just the truth. You &gt;200% in gains in a matter of days. That's not normal and it implies a high level of volatility.

Again, you might not like this, but volatility doesn't only point in one direction. You shoot up 400% then drop 50%, you're still up 200%.

Again, you might not like this, but it's how these things work.

GME is not trading rationally at all. That's the whole point of ""squeeze"" you force irrational price action that is detached from fundamentals. So yeah, when you get as detached as GME is, you're going to run into problems.",1,0,1615736869,BagofBabbish
