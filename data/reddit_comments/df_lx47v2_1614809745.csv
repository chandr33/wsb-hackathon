22,gpl3rby,"Okay so if we put AAPL back at the p/e ratio it was at ath right before covid, then the share price would be $85.33. It doubled by mkt cap in 2019 but not earnings. 

I agree aapl should overall have a higher p/e multiple and I'm literally bag holding a 50k loss with 128/127 spreads that expire friday so trust me, I want aapl to succeed. But that's the argument people are making during this sell off, and I guess it's sticking. It would be foolish not to recalibrate just cuz I don't like whats going on. Perhaps we'll see slow decline in tech over the next few months like in 2015",1,0,1614809766,steakandp1e
