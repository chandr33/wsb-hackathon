3,gqdx4jz,"I went with GME primarily because they're looking at an entirely new business model whereas AMC seems to be just biding their time until they can reopen and get back to business. My interpretation of the latter is that the return to business is already somewhat priced in so you *need* a gamma squeeze to make money. Whereas GME has been leveraging all this fun to fundamentally change their business model so there's a better chance to make money even if everyone is wrong about the squeeze. That said, I think the squeeze is real, I don't think the squeeze has squozen, and once I went all in on GME, I stopped watching AMC news.
