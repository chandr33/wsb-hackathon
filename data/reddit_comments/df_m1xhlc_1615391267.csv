14,gqgfuqu,"Adding my own “What this means”

HF already have billions and losing won’t mean they won’t know where the next meal comes from. It just means they have to sell off some billion dollar assets they barely use to cover losses. 

For my wife and I, it means independence. We were extremely lucky and got a decent windfall that we didn’t need to use right away but we are in a living situation we need out of as soon as we can manage. That windfall gets us close to the goal of moving but not there. I put most of it (Only risk what you are willing to lose) into GME and AMC. We just doubled the GME investment today (the windfall came in just as GME crossed $100 😫. I wanted to get in at $50). And our total investment should be doubled by the end of the week. 

If this keeps up at this pace, we will not only be able to move but will be debt free, will be able to afford a couple medical things, and (if we do hit Mars) we might even be able to buy a house. 

This means a whole new life of security, peace, and independence. If this fails, we lose a couple months in our plan and I take extra shifts.",1,0,1615391271,CalebTGordan
