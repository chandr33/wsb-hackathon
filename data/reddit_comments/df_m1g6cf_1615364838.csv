55,gqfd53h,"I'm looking into it more, I haven't seen the most recent (12 hr old) news cycle.

It still looks meritless IMO

&gt; House Democrats called on the Biden administration Tuesday to halt the U.S. Postal Service‚Äôs $482 million contract with Oshkosh Defense to help modernize the service‚Äôs aging fleet of delivery trucks **until an investigation can prove there was no ‚Äúinappropriate political influence‚Äù in the award.**

I am a little worried about this bit

&gt;  However, USPS chief Louis DeJoy recently told lawmakers that only 10% of the new fleet would be electric, which ‚Äúwould be inconsistent‚Äù with President Joe Biden‚Äôs efforts to electrify the entire federal fleet, the lawmakers said.

I heard someone mention that the OSK vehicles were hybrids though, which would 'electrify' the fleet.

I *am* biased, as an $F investor, since they would be supplying OSK. Please tear me down.",1,0,1615364955,synapsesynopsis

EUROPCAR is what I'm talking about. 

Close to ATL, was a 5‚Ç¨ stock (even on decline) in 12/2019 and steadily went down as Covid became more and more of a problem. On like 0.27-0.29‚Ç¨ recently.

With them apparently making it through and the huge pent-up demand for travelling which is likely to come back in Q3 or Q4 the latest, who's to say this couldn't be a 10x to 20x gamble?
