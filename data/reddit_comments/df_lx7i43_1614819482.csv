21,gploiwe,"A few things to consider: the lockup expired on the 18th, but that meant that the shares could be made available for distribution at the investors' accounts. It would have taken 5-7 days (according to another DD) for the shares to be sellable. 

Soros promised to divest their 18.5M shares (as of Jan) on principle. Those should be hitting the market by now. 

The tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. 

Finally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. 

Overall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way. I'm in.",45,0,1614820606,jsntx

PLTR is not TSLA, MSFT, AAPL or any other company people try to compare it to.  4B revenue in 5 years is not that great.  I understand people are excited about the CEO and the ‚Äúlimitless‚Äù possibilities of the software but right now, they haven‚Äôt demonstrated that they can get decent revenues or retain clients.  Worst of all, their cost of revenue went WAY up on last earnings.  Future business should be getting cheaper for a mature company like PLTR, they aren‚Äôt a startup.  My last problem with them, too many fan boys who are trading emotionally rather than logically.  PLTR will grow steadily but they will not be busting out to 100B+ anytime soon.
