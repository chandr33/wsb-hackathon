1,gq9h7cz,"Hey man that's the market. GME is a retarded play that doesn't make any sense (at least not without letting go of everything you think you know and trusting internet randos), don't blame yourself for not going in. It's an insanely beautiful thing that it's working, and it's easy to regret in hindsight, but put yourself back to when you made the decision and it's nothing more than a gamble you weren't willing to make. It's like folding a terrible hand in poker then the flop gives you a straight. Statistically and logically you made the right play. Just keep your head on and look for the next winner. Keep your eye on GME too this shit could yo-yo a few more times.",1,0,1615242031,esplin9566

3,gq9idnn,"I mostly agree, but still, it's not easy to dump money into something that could possibly drop massively at any moment. Especially after it already blew up once. ""What are the chances it happens again"" type thinking.

Unless you got in sub $40 you can't escape the reality that the price *might* fall out from under you back to that floor. Regardless of how likely that is to happen, it's a big risk that no one should feel bad for not taking.",2,0,1615242592,esplin9566
