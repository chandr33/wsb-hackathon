Today EUA have the worst financial accounts of history can remember, more than 7% of the American population are poor, more than 500 k people died with Covid-19, more than 24 Million people are with Covid! Your country cant handle with that! Now Im leaving with the questions:  Europoors or americanpoors? 
I can speak about how manipulate are Americans! But I don’t want to enter in that! I can speak what you do in capitol house some months ago! I can speak about how racist American people are! So many topic to speak! I don’t want! Bye bye! See you on the moon and I will teach you what is a Democratic country where everyone can express an opinion and not be judge by that!
