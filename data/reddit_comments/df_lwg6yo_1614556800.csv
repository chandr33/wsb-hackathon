I bought the 25c OTM last week.  It blew up today, I pocketed about $10k and bought $8500 of the $50c out where I could find them.  This is called a Freeroll and THIS IS THE WAY.

43,gph9bra,"There are 115M class A shares. There are 1.869B class  D shares, mostly tied up with the ceo, although also with institutions. 115M is 6% approx of the 1.869B, but a lot of the institutions that hold the class D can swap them out and sell them. Class D has 10 votes for every 1 vote of class A. So the dampening effect that OP is mentioning is that institutions will be rushing to sell their class Ds, but the important thing is that CEO owns most of the class D. But the institutions could double the float of class A if they all dump their class B. Wider question is whether hedge funds by the new OTM strikes listed tomorrow. If we get cats buying $100 strikes in size, we will get a gamma squeeze. TLDR you are both kind of right",1,0,1614731479,takerisksyoung

ceo and insiders own 90 %",1,0,1614748437,Lazytrader17
67,gpio6ig,"Let's clear up a misconception here.

The publicly traded shares total 115M.

In addition the founders can exchange their shares in the underlying entity for shares in RKT. The founders own about 1.8B or so shares accordingly.

I don't think they can just arbitrarily sell shares. Further, the owner hates shorts and would probably rather watch them get destroyed then stop a squeeze.

So, no, there are simply not that many shares available for trading.

And then there is the simple point that the stock might be fairly valued at $50+ a share, so if you were the owner this squeeze with a current price of $44 (pre-market) would barely be a tempting reason to sell.",1,0,1614764762,aka0007
68,gpiokot,"I think based on the open interest data (not sure if it is from close of yesterday or day before) there are something like 40M+ options in the money.

With 115M shares out there, plus shorts needing to cover as price goes up, this party is just getting started.

Then of course there is the issue that $40+ might still be a good price to buy and hold the darn stock at in the first place.

It should be good.",1,0,1614765145,aka0007
