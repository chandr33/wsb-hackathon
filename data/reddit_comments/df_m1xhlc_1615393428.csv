46,gqglebe,"So call options are like contracts that say when the stock price hits a certain number, youre allowed to buy like 100 shares at a price you agreed on some time in the past. These contracts become 'In the money' when the share price hits whatever their 'strike price' is and allows people to either buy those shares for that lower price or sell that contract to someone else that wants to buy the shares.

They have an expiry date so this friday we should see some jumps if im correct in my limited understanding of options.
