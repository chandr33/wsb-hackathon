47,gqgd4sh,"Make sure you have a rough plan to hedge your risk by taking smaller percentage profit on the way up to the peak. Like personally I am setting aside 13% of my shares to intentionally take profits before the peak at pre-determined percentages of my initial investment.   
And I have 3 different strategies to employ with the 13% ranging from fearful to ballsy. For example first strike is  I'm selling 2% of my shares to cover 20% of of my investment, next strike would be maybe 2% to cover 30%, then one more to cover 40%. That leaves more than 6% of shares left to play ""guess the peak"" and 85% of shares to ride the peak down.   
This way you never sell early, never FOMO the peak, and never ruin uptrend momentum",1,0,1615390070,FreeHKTaiwanNumber1

I‚Äôm not joking what possible market share could they grab that going justify this market cap. If you bought this company privately it would take over 100 years to get your money back.. this ain‚Äôt a growth stock and their market share goes down by the year.. the original DD was amazing and truly based of real info and short float...

I‚Äôm not trying to just shit on gme I made a bunch buying at $20 and selling at when the squeeze happened at $250 on the come down... but other then hype I‚Äôm having a very hard time understanding how it‚Äôs even possible for them to generate enough profit to justify this now.
