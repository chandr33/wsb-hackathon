If these values are proven correct, my calculations have the peak value at $1080+/-$110 based off the previous 52 week high. Plan accordingly if my values for tomorrow and friday math where the stock closes.

Only time will tell if I am correct, but I am excited to see today's trends.

My calculations are based off a proportional mapping of our current values to the equivalent points on the chart of the January run up. My hypothesis is that we are following the trends we saw in January close enough that the currant EoD values can be mapped to EoD values from the January trend lines.",19,0,1614866251,Prohamen
