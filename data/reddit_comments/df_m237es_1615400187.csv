Not everyone on here is looking to become millionaires. Some of us have some money in the market and want to make a decent play. The reason there are these aggressive attacks is because shorts technically have infinite potential in losses. As the stock goes higher and higher, the short has more and more downside. A hedge fund way over-leveraged themselves, and people are riding the wave. Some are joining much later and may lose money from FOMO + selling after seeing a drop like we just saw not realizing that at some point Melvin will have to cover and buy en masse.",1,0,1615400194,Heath1872
