2,gqilbgf,"Automatic upvote for actual DD and not GME circle jerking.

Also I will confirm your anecdotal evidence of make-up doctor visits and lab work. I didn't get my annual labs or a physical last year due to covid. Got my physical 3 weeks ago and just went to Quest to have blood drawn today. 

I'm not in this play, but thanks for the writeup",16,0,1615424653,-ksguy-

27,gt1pne9,"So realistically the assumption (both yours and all of the other analysts I’ve read opinions on) is that DGX is worth anywhere from 130-150. 
I agree thank you for the intelligent DD. I’m newer to the forum and while I understand that GME is a once in a long time event and I do agree that Ryan Cohen will be a stellar leader it would be nice to have DD’s on other companies.

That being said I’d like to pose a question to you . Do you think revenues have been adversely affected due to COVID- meaning do you think people have put off going to the Doctor, which would order various diagnostic tests to treat patients for cholesterol, diabetes or any of the conditions that require regular diagnostic tests? If the answer is yes how much of an impact would that have on revenues? 

If yes this could support your bull thesis further, though I suppose it would also support their competitor too if they don’t have majority market share.

Just some thoughts I had bouncing around after reading a bit on DGX. They do seem promising even trading at the levels they are today (129ish) it’s still 10-20% undervalued IMO.

Disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor - don’t be a sloth do your own DD. I do not currently own looking to make add",1,0,1617295009,Makeitmultiply
