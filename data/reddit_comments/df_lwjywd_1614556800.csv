59,gphxwd6,"After giving it a great amount of thought, I think RKT will ride up until the day BEFORE the dividend date.  I think the boomer investors and institutions are holding to the dividend date for an easy pay out and likely will sell after that.  Therefore, most people will sell the day before.  So, probably will tank Friday either before or after market.

Also, the volume is there.  The daily volume on RKT today was 376M, which is 2217% over normal.  The fucking after hours volume was 19.52M, which is insanely high.  Normally, when a stock goes parabolic, you see volume like this.  If it was about to crash, the volume would be turning to shit... it isn't, it is increasing.

With that said, I think there is a REASONABLE chance, given the SUPER HIGH short interest, that this thing goes GME style parabolic and we might have a multi day or even multi week GME style situation on our hands.

That said, I have decided to load up tomorrow and will hold until end of day Thursday UNLESS it looks like it may go parabolic due to shorts at that point.  Then I may YOLO it.",25,0,1614744241,FunctionVoidSmall

40% of the shares being shorted means that if a ton of investors start buying, those shorts are fucked.  They have to cover eventually, 40% of the shares buying in causes the stock to go parabolic and skyrocket.

If it was 1% shorted, it wouldn't be enough to impact the price of the stock.",9,0,1614744451,FunctionVoidSmall
