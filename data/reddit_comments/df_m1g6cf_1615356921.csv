71,gqf4cq7,"but let me tell you this: The royal family is investigating Meghan for accusation of harassing her staff  
This is the same royal family who turned a blind eye to the accusation of the prince Andrew the pedophile.  
Can you imagine someone who is accused of being pedophile living happily ever after, but this women is being investigated because she was mean to her staff, this surely screams like they are so against her and want to destroy her image either way.  
Why would she abandon this palace if she was loved and welcomed? She became a princess, what more she wants?  
I think it wasn't a choice, they really did not want her, but did it in a very subtle way, so it seems like it was their choice to leave. but actually it was not a choice at all. She wasn't wanted.
