1,gqhuoqg,"Yeah absolutely. This list essentially shows you huge bets that other people or institutions are making on a stock. In other words, what ""smart money"" is doing. If someone is betting $4 million that GM will go up, they probably have done their homework so it gives me a starting off point to do research on this particular stock. 

Keep in mind that there is no way of knowing why someone made this trade, it could be that they are hedging their bets on another trade, so don't ever follow it blindly. Still, it's a good way to get a list of stocks you may have not been thinking about before.",1,0,1615411510,smith1302
2,gqhuvvz,I am a bot. This Technical Analysis does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.
