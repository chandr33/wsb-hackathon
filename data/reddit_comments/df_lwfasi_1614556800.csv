To be completely honest I see this and $RKT as a EoY play. Once those interest rates go up these go down. RKT is a little better insulated IMO. Also, the fed could keeps rates the same for 2022 we don‚Äôt know. although UWMC does have the unique tech factor, which was built in house and beats industry standards by 2x (?) I think. Unless we see UWMC and their unique tech being the driving force for vertical growth my time horizon is EoY and a SP in the $28-32 range.
