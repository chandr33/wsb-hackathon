19,gqg54eg,"Bob buys GME share through broker X. Broker X, or Bob, depending on the way broker operates, can sell the share for short: it means, Bob is still owner of the share for all intents and purposes, but there is a new ""copy"" that's created, as a loan, that is rented out. The person who buys the copy of share pays rent on it, based on stock price.

How shorters make money then is that they sell the copy of share onward. They then hope the price of the stock goes down, so that they can buy the share back from the market later at much discounted price, and return it.

Selling shares drives the price down, so shorting massive number of shares = price goes down, at least for a bit.",1,0,1615386413,KapteeniJ
