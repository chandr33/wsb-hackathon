There were probably a lot of people who bought in at $350 during the first squeeze who'd been holding that shit waiting to break even. I get that and it's good that they're out now. 

We can fairly expect many more of thewse massive sell-offs leading up to the 19th and maybe then some. Remember it maxed at 483. If it hits that mark again, there'll probably be another sell-off. DO NOT FALL FOR THAT SHIT.

Hedgies have run out of tricks. They can sell and leave GME to the apes or suffer more losses. I highly doubt any bank or other firm is going to help them now. Ow and on top of this they might actually end up being investigated deeply for the fuckery.
