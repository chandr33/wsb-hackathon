40,gqbokjl,"I get that, but here‚Äôs the thing, and my prime example. Where I live (Germany), the 12 y/o Mac runs for about ‚Ç¨58-65. The Mac 12 Sherry Oak is even between ‚Ç¨85-90. Here‚Äôs the thing: Glendronach 12 also happens to be a sherried whisky. Its price is between ‚Ç¨32 and ‚Ç¨40, which means the Mac 12 Sherry Oak is about 2-3 times as expensive. The problem is that Glendronach 12 is widely regarded (and my experience is that as well) is one of the, if not *the* best 12 year old there is. There‚Äôs no way in hell that Macallan is worth that much money, especially if chances are that it doesn‚Äôt even hold up to the Glendronach. So I‚Äôd rather buy 2-3 bottles of very good 12 year old Glendronach than pay that stupidly high price for Macallan.",1,0,1615296023,TheCatInTheHatThings
