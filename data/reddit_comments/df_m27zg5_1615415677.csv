30,gqi3zjl,"I got wrecked because of RH and FOMO in Jan, then sold and ate the losses. When Keith indicated he'd doubled his shares I got back in and this ride erased my losses, so I took profits. Yeah yeah.

Today, I looked at GME even though I'm out, and when I saw that insane drop had happened, I got mad at hedges and went back in, because I wanted to blunt the panic as much as I could afford. I knew if enough people bought the dip, we could staunch the bleed. It worked, as near as I can tell.

I'm not in for 1,000 a share. But I'll pay attention to short attacks and buy in when I can. I'd ask people if they've seen anything like this, but hell, I've never even *heard* of anything like the last three months and this stock.",6,0,1615415712,BlackBlades
