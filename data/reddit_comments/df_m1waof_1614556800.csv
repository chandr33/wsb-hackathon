35,gqfu9hd,"Nobody learned their lesson the first time. When GME settled back down in the 100 range, they all shorted again. Because if it made sense to short at $40 it made more sense to short at $100. But this time they shorted even more to make back the gains they lost last time.

Their hubris is understandable. After all, we’re just a bunch of retards, and they’re seasoned financial investors. All the same, their hubris will bring their demise. 

Now they are scrambling to cover their naked shorts. They will need to buy a few million shares this week to cover their short positions.

read the whole thing, and it makes sense.  I think a lot about this ""100K not a meme"" thing, because i believe in the domino effect and how prices are just too beautifully line up. 

but process has many levers that allow if to be halted when hf go bankrupt and go out of business, i am pretty sure what an APE can claim will be limited to what the HF's liquidated assets. i do not think RH purchases halting is the only possible interference mechanism out there...
