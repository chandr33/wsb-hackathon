76,gqi03ne,"Another reason for the dip today:

The HFs who are long GME or “on our side” orchestrated the dip today to trigger the SSR (meaning no one can short the stock tomorrow when it's falling, and it triggered it at $222.21). The SSR could inhibit the plans that the shorts had prepared for tomorrow to drop the stock.

Simultaneously, the HFs who are long GME doubled down on options, 60k+ $300-$400 strike prices were bought up during the dip &amp; a shit ton of $800 expiring Friday. Short attacks will be difficult tomorrow, this could potentially be the start.

You're already in.  Just hold and enjoy the ride.

We're gonna get back up to 300 then 350 then 400 then god knows.

It's just a matter of when.

Even if the stock drops to 40, just hold.

It'll come back up next month or so.  Just watch the memes.  When WSB is flooded with GME memes, GME goes up.

Just see the pattern from Jan till today.

One thing to remember is we have pissed off veteran bagholders from January who came in at 330, 400, etc.  And we also have those that cut their loses in January and came back in in March.

We're pissed off.  They won in January with dirty tactics.  The same tactics don't scare us.

Just watch how quick we dropped today from 350 and we rose back up to opening levels within minutes.

We're pissed.  We already lost.  We got nothing else to lose.  We're holding to bleed them dry.  And as we do, GME is just going to keep on rising.",2,0,1615413907,WoobyWiott
