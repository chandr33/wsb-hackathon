40,gqi0i4n,"Correct...and they only have a 3-day window to use the shares so as of now they are back to 100k or less shorts. That number is quite possibly 0 also but there's really no way of knowing unless you can calculate how many they borrowed and how many they used based off of the ticker during the past 3 days. If they did zero attacks tomorrow they could potentially save all of that days shares for Friday but if they don't attack the price tomorrow then it could grow so high that they would just be pissing into the wind at that point. I don't foresee a similar big dip in the near future but do foresee a few smaller dips. They would have to be more retarded than us to do this type of attack again. This attack also showed how MSM is ""possibly"" in cahoots with the HFs and manipulating the market so technically there should be an investigation by the SEC or a huge microscope on the MSM and HFs until this thing is over but if not then this likely proves that the HFs and MSM are in the SECs, which we had already assumed based on the shenanigans the past couple months with no action taken by the SEC.",2,0,1615414069,FlibaFlabaJack
