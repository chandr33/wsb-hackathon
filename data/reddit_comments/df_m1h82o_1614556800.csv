21,gqdn4oq,Streaming does not matter at all for AMC. Just ask yourself this: how much have you enjoyed watching movies on your couch for the entire pandemic? Wouldn't you like to go out sometimes to watch a movie with friends? I've said this many times and I'll never be tired of repeating that the pandemic has only proven that physical theaters solve a problem technology can't yet solve meaningfully: human interaction,7,0,1615327020,drestonxyz

AMC (the theater chain not the network) will never get into the streaming game because that’s not their business model, they don’t have the knowledge or infrastructure to support it, and so far have given zero indication that said strategy is even in their future. 

I like AMC because the American economy will be coming back online within the next six months and folks (like most of us here) want to go to a movie theater. 

That alone should get us a fair bump, but if they continue adapting (as they should) we should be good.
