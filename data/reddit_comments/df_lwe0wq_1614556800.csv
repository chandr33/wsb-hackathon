0,gpgu0qc,"This is terrible advice. Rates are going up because of inflation. There is no downward pressure mechanism on rates at the moment and more trillion dollar stimulus programs in the pipeline only putting more upward pressure on rates to control even more inflation. They are going to keep going higher and as a result put downward pressure on the market. Ironically enough your gold call will be right because we have both  enter a period of high inflation and rising rates.

TLDR: Rates are going higher. The dollar will go lower. The market will go lower and gold will higher over the next 6 months at least.",6,0,1614723832,outofsync42

4,gpguk8y,The market in general trades higher on lower rates because bonds don't pay well enough to offset the risk of being in stocks. Rates are going higher right now to curb inflation and a result bond yields begin to come in line with the dividend yields of the S&amp;P and large funds no longer justify taking the risk of owning a stock when then can get the same long term yield in a bond.,2,0,1614724091,outofsync42
5,gpgurmn,"Don't forget the impact of Stimulus Bill.  The news of a deal will boost markets until they realize that most of spending is in out years which will be a damper.  Then it becomes all about rates.

So you got 2 moving issues and to trade off them is very difficult for the time being.  That is not some epiphany just look at the major index charts.",3,0,1614724189,IAintInTheClub

9,gph0gni,Large institutions and pension funds have calculations that determine risk of owning stocks vs bonds. Dividend yield is very much apart of the equation. When bonds don't pay well they move money into stocks. Its why we have had a bull market since 2009,1,0,1614726950,outofsync42

12,gph41ei,"nah man your analysis is too weak here, u gotta fix the basics of what institutionals are pricing and how they look at this stuff. 

Yes the stimulus bill is a net negative for NQ valuations but it's also good for earnings.

This is just a rotation out of tech precipitated by rebalancing and bonds moderate uptick. 

Tech is still the way to go, buying shitty cyclicals is gonna go the way of the dodo.
