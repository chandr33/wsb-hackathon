11,gqi5kys,"The Hedgies who are shorting, had to drive down the price because we were at $340 and going up still, which means more ITM calls for next week, the momentum would have been at $500 this Friday (Could still happen). Next Monday would have triggered an infinity squeeze and our $1000+ GME Stonk price. They are postponing until earnings call, where they're betting on Gamestop missing EPS and tanking the stock, recovering their short ground and capital. Unless earnings are better than expected and Gamestop Execs officially announce the digital strategy to offset it, then GME will really moon after earnings call and the HF are still fuked.",9,0,1615416484,doscillating_bass

DOWNVOTES?!?!??!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?",-16,0,1615416516,SeoNeoGeo
46,gqi5ndp,"Call me insane but here‚Äôs my theory: 

Huge UI (unknown institution) released all of their shares in GME at the same time to force a massive dip. With this massive dip they repositioned with an extremely high amount of calls (amount of calls purchased went up greatly during the crash). Now that they technically carry a much larger position with said calls, they will profit much greater. If there is a gamma squeeze on Thursday 3/11 and it surpasses $800/share, it would force a margin call on certain hedge funds. 

With said margin calls, it would further increase the price now as smaller firms begin covering. With the price continuing to go up, it would create a chain of margin calls on hedge funds as they‚Äôre all forced to cover. This would leave many out of their positions and unable or unwilling to do anything on Friday. 

TL:DR; ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù institution forced price drop via share dump to reposition at a much bigger position with calls at the bottom. This forces a greater reaction when it comes to squeezing time üíéüôåüèªüöÄüöÄüöÄ

edit: if this were to happen it would also open massive doors for GameStop. They could force a share recall on Sunday, going into effect Monday, and literally murder anyone with a short position.  

edit2: if all calls up to $800 are ITM between 3/11-3/12 there‚Äôs the ability for the institutions holding said calls to exercise them and further force a price increase. If one institution owns a massive amount (let‚Äôs say 40k+ calls) and exercises them all at the same time, it‚Äôs game over. Something like that would very quickly and very violently force the squeeze.",38,0,1615416516,notGoran69

54,gqi5o3u,"No I'm convinced that's the article they posted to replace it with which is even more suspicious. It contains exerpts from the original article that the Tweet screencapped and you can't find the original article on Market Watch now. You can still find the original article on random smaller sites like Report Door without a time stamp.

https://www.reportdoor.com/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted/

But when you follow any external links back to Market Watch for the article it conveniently takes you directly to the new one on Market Watch with a later published time stamp and an entirely different headline. So either the original Tweet is photoshopped or for some reason Market Watch took the old one down, wrote a different one combining it with exerpts from the old one and intentionally posted it later rather than just posting it as an update. Idk it just seems really damn suspicious considering the accusation now. Why delete the original in question?",11,0,1615416526,Moonwlkr50
