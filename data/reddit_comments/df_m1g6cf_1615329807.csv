9,gqdt1xf,"Run down: 

Long calls : can but doesn't have to close position at expiry and it expires worthless out of the money. 

Short call: when u have the stock and want to make cash in case it drops. Short call writers are obligated to provide the stock at the holders request.

Long put: same as call but you make the money on the lower side (reverse movement to the stock). Expires worthless out of the money.

Short put: when you have money for the stock at the strike price, set it aside until expiry and keep the Premium. Obligated to buy stock at put holders request. 

Option writers want the contract to expire worthless. Holders want to beat the writers, but the writers mostly win.

So much more to it but that's the types of options and what they're for fwiw.",2,0,1615329814,joshgeek
