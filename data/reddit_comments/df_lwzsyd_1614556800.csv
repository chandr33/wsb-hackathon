0,gpk3cj0,"This is all true.  People at BIS are discussing revaluing silver to at least $600 an ounce.  I haven't heard about gold, but to cover current US debt with official US gold requires about $100k per ounce.",6,0,1614793963,ThoriumAcetate

4,gpk5d71,"I have heard no less than $3000/oz for Gold initially (second half of 2021), but as much as $20,000/oz by the end of 2023. I had not heard anything on Silver.

I dont believe it will be $100k per ounce because I dont believe the goal is to cover/back all US Debt with gold, but rather to make the global banks more stable than they currently are.",5,0,1614794829,m756615

8,gpkb44q,"Let's say I believe you. But most of my capital is tied up bag holding GME. The real question is, would using options on SLV be the cheap lotto ticket on this?",1,0,1614797301,xaekai
9,gpkbdkr,Long term. I'd recommend January 2023. That way you don't need to worry about it,2,0,1614797416,m756615

15,gpkkc4f,Okay so you are old enough to have read books and watched conferences and debates fucking twenty years ago talking about the same shit .. All of a sudden this is going to happen now in your opinion ? Not last year with the pandemic and stock larket crash for example ?,1,0,1614801281,TheHigherSpace
16,gpklaki,"I am old enough to have made enough mistakes to know better. There is a strategy that is probably one of the best out there for portfolios that are under a million dollars. Even more so for portfolios that are around $100,000. I was even thinking of starting my own hedge fund. 

Anyway, a single ticker should be no more than 5-7% of your total portfolio. All I am trying to do here with this post is to say hey all you younglings out there, Rather than make mistakes like I did, why not take 5-7% of your portfolio and invest it in gold and silver? You really have nothing to lose and you've got a lot of time. An example strategy aside from holding the physical asset, would be to purchase leap contracts for January 2023 and then selling monthly calls on those contracts. The strategy is like a covered call but you're only dealing with options so you're able to leverage 100 shares per contract. Then you could do this strategy with other tickers as well. 

The goal is to look for undervalued investments. It is not wise to invest over 50% of your portfolio in speculative investments. And you got people all over this message board investing 100% into speculative investments. That is not going to end well for 99% of the people doing it. but I know those 99% are going to look at the 1% who managed to successfully do it and think they can be just like that 1%. Even though that 1% succeeded largely in part by luck of timing. 

Good luck to you.",2,0,1614801696,m756615

Also when you say ""people are discussing"" is that stuff you are hearing, or is there some source on that?

21,gpllntm,"Bond yields going up means no one is buying which means central banks have to print even more to keep them down, which means more inflation. Yields going up is positive for gold. 

The historical relationship of yields going up to be bad for gold is based on when we were on gold standard, when it meant people were selling gold.",4,0,1614818897,MaxKevinComedy

32,gt9tcel,"Gold is in the most obvious cup-and-handle pattern I've ever seen.

If you're right about these changes then the gold/physical market will start to reflect what we see with the rhodium market (no paper market) in that the fundamentals inherently affect the price.  This will be interesting if this happens.",1,0,1617476616,timfcrn
