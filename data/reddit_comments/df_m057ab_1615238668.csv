2,gq9dbdk,"Not sure what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish here.  Was that meant to be informative or insulting?  If you, as a casual observer, are informing me about myself - that would seem pretty pretentious right?  If that was meant to be insulting, it seems to be limited by its loose relationship with reality.  Either way, not sure you‚Äôve taken the best approach when you decided to participate here.  Can‚Äôt imagine many people would be interested in leasing your mind professor haha",1,0,1615240227,IOwnMyOwnMind

5,gq9htjc,"&gt;I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

There's a lot I wanted to say to you, but this is really important to me:


Your server isn't fucking struggling.  In any city larger then a few hundred thousands people,  your server is easily making $18-$40 an hour, nor are they paying taxes on a large portion of their income,  since they don't report it(cash tips).


Meanwhile the COOK is making minimum wage or, *tops*, $14/$15 hour(even in large cities you won't see much more. As an exec chef,  I've rarely ever seen a cook make $15, in multiple cities).


This equates to the server making $75-$300(or more)  in a six hour shift or so, and the cooks making 25%-50% of that. Really - this is in no way hyperbolic.  At my restaurant the cooks are pulling 19-24k a year working 40 hours - the servers are pulling 40-50k/  doing 35 hour weeks, with far more flexible scheduling.



And don't even get me started on working holidays Jesus f****** Christ, it's literally impossible to be a cook in a restaurant and get a single holiday off, but if that wasn't bad enough, you get to work a 10 or 15 hour shift with no holiday pay,  and then watch a server walk in and make $100 on a single table because they ""feel bad for the poor server working holidays."" That server will then make in a couple days what it took you two weeks to make.




It's even better to prepare a  12 top to go or something  and then hand it to the 17 yo to-go girl and watch her walk 20 feet and then  hand someone a couple bags and get a $20 tip.



Please.  For the fucking love of god. Tip your cooks if you're worried about people who need money - they will appreciate it more and it will go to guys who are *constantly* getting shafted.",1,0,1615242323,StarkillerEmphasis
6,gq9idt6,"So to be clear - you said i am taking terrible care of my mind, but meant i am a condescending, elitist, and also a cunt.  interesting approach but i see where you are coming from. 

it seems like the majority of your comment is addressing things completely distinct from what i am talking about.  do you see what i mean by that?  did you mean to talk about different things, or do you not realize you are talking about different things now?

if you are going to comment on someone else's mind, do a quick check and ensure yours is working properly to avoid becoming an easy target.",1,0,1615242594,IOwnMyOwnMind

13,gqa1rbs,"I get your point about the disparity between cooks n servers. 

But I've been a server in at least 5 different chain restaurants and yes,  I was struggling.  I NEVER made the kind of money you are talking about. $300 in a shift. 

Maybe, since you are an ""executive chef"", you worked at higher price point restaurants? Don't think places like Olive Garden have exec chefs? Not sure. 

At least I never heard them refer to anyone like that. 

I worked TWO jobs, at one point juggling 3, even as a server because it didn't pay the bills.  I was a single mom for a year or so while separated,  and guarantee you,  the pitiful number of shifts I got as a server didn't cover it. By far.

Yes,  you can make more per hour as a server than most low skilled or entry jobs. That's why I did it. Just like bartender. 

BUT, you typically won't make good $$, EVEN as a server is you suck at people skills and customer service. I can't tell you how many shitty servers would complain about their table stiffing them,  and never realized their piss poor attitude was the reason why. 

So when I have a really good server, I always want to tip them well.

But guarantee you,  just because someone may make more $$ than you, doesn't mean  they aren't or can't possibly be struggling.

I honestly never heard of tipping the cook, even working in the service industry.

I will do that too, next time I want to spread the wealth around.",1,0,1615252828,traderbabe22
