0,gph20gh,I like them. I am long thcx and potx. Both look like they will go higher on the charts and they have a nice yield.  Obviously if the market crashes it will be broad based.,3,0,1614727733,Heatherton2000

3,gph2b6t,Ive been riding the green wave up and down for a couple.months now. Your guess isngood as mine. The industry itself is definitely going to keep.growing. An etf may be the safest way forward in my completely uneducated opinion? Def not advice. Just regurgitating what ive read/experienced.,2,0,1614727884,humblestgod

6,gph2zn9,I somewhat agree. Although i do think that the legalization will help larger companys like canopy. Its just not in the short term. I feel the stock might hit lows before they rebound to new highs.,2,0,1614728234,TheInvestmentGod

9,gph3j4w,"I'm into weed distribution. Got several thousand shares of $HITIF. They have been doing well the last few weeks. They are the biggest brick and motor distributor in Canada and have started expanding into the usa. I think distribution is probably better than betting on a specific farm. $msos is another good pick since this is a usa centric weed etf. I expect them to continue to rise.

13,gph457h,"This is just my gut, no actual facts backing this up, but I don‚Äôt think the larger ones (APHA/TLRY, CGC) are going to tank...I think they‚Äôll continue to wobble around a bit, up and down 10%-20% maybe until we have some actual US legalization news...then üöÄ for a day or two, then come down a bit and establish a new support level. Then strong long term growth. All that to say, idk short term, but I‚Äôm holding onto mine bc long term I think these are goldmines 

The lower quality ones I don‚Äôt touch though...No ACB or SNDL for me.
