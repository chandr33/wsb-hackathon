13,gq3thq0,"Another thing to keep in mind is that Wall Street loves to invent new ways of investing in the same product for the purposes of making more money.

One of the core reasons that the Housing Market Crash of 2008 became an international economic crisis was because Wall Street created Synthetic C.D.O’s.

Essentially, this allows a single investment to create a potentially infinite chain of investing as people invest on the outcomes of the investment.

Yet once the core investment failed, the other synthetic chain of investments failed as well.

We see Wall Street do this now with GME. For example, they short ETF funds that have holdings in GME. 

This creates  a roundabout method of shorting a stock that goes under the radar.

Besides, if all short interests were covered for GME, then shorters wouldn’t have lost nearly $1B from the Wednesday Spike for GME, and there would be millions more shares available to short.

Once that happened, don't hate me for this, I feel we are next on the menu.

However that would bring them in the same situation as the OG HFs were in before. And we would go round and round again.
