16,gqqo6x1,"I also was curious how interest rate played a role. I am not a financial advisor and this is just a simple observation so if I was to loan security and I did not have any buyers I would lower the interest rate to entice the borrowers. If I was to raise the interest rate that could mean two things, 1. I felt the trade was risky 2. Demand was extremely high.

It seems to me that the Bears have lost their appetite to short the stock at this time and are waiting for the line to break because only when the line is broken is it worth shorting again.

I think the reason now that the interest rate is low is because of the new rule clarifications making it a less risky trade than before. 

Either way, I still like the stock.",1,0,1615588228,P1ckl2_J61c2

51,gqroj3v,"I think you should read the full discussion under the post as many comments explain this in a manner easy to understand. The SI is NOT 200-900% and even a dumb person, after a little reading and educating himself would understand that. The more real figure is like 20-25% and rather decrising, 14 mln shares to cover, that is not ""fake"" and much more realistic than whatever hundreds of tons you may wish to be true. Yet, its still a high number but mind you, rather expected to decrease in time as its been happening for some time now. That is one of the reasons stock price have gone up. They are doing it slowly and same time defending the up peak price controlling it and not allowing the price to jump up and skyrocket which would take it out of control. If anything important happens (like a good finacial report or future plans announcement) that could be catalyst for the price to jump up (no control, skyrocket, to the moon) than we have things squeezed but if nothing of the kind happens, it may take a while for the shorters to buy back and cover, 14 mln is not a small number so it wont happen in one day, I assume and then the price may go down I think. If they keep shorting agressilvy, the process may repeat. I dont think they would tho cause that would mean they are complete idiots, lol. The whole world is watching, I think all they dream of is to clean that shit asap and never touch gme again. But then again, I dont know much, that is purely my opinion and may be as well wrong.

62,gqs3gow,"This is wrong, and the squeezemetric white paper is fundamentally flawed. The volume of dark pool transactions doesn't come close to being enough shares to cover the shorts that are reported daily by FINRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Squeezemetric paper error

 \- They state and assume that the FINRA daily short reports are only from Dark Pools.  ""The TRFs receive data from exclusively off-exchange, or “dark,” venues. "" A TRF is a Trade Reporting Facility and there are 3 main ones NYSE (N), NASDAQ Carteret (Q) and NASDAG Chicago (B).  [http://regsho.finra.org/DailyShortSaleVolumeFileLayout.pdf](http://regsho.finra.org/DailyShortSaleVolumeFileLayout.pdf) 

If you look at the daily short reports, they show these TRFs - B, Q, N in the data. The TRFs are the major exchanges, and they are reporting the daily volume only during market hours. [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). This is the actual volume traded through the major exchanges during the normal trading day. This is NOT dark pool trading, that is listed somewhere else entirely - see below. [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trade-reporting-facility-trf](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trade-reporting-facility-trf)

 This is where squeezemetric fucked up. FINRA reporting for Dark Pools trading is listed elsewhere, and reported as an ATS or Alternate Trading System. That data is published once a week. You can find it here - [https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/AtsIssueData](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/AtsIssueData)  \-if you look at a stocks dark pool trades for a certain week you can also see every dark pool that traded the stock.  FINRA's explanation of the reporting here - [https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2014/finra-makes-dark-pool-data-available-free-investing-public](https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2014/finra-makes-dark-pool-data-available-free-investing-public). The dark pool reporting only shows volume, it does not show shorts or anything else to indicate who is buying and who is selling through dark pools. GME is a NMS Tier 2 stock for this reporting. The ATS has to report weekly volume 7 days after the end of the reporting week. That data is released another 4 weeks later, so it is delayed 5 weeks for NMS tier 2. The most recent reporting date is Jan 25 for Tier 2, which shows the trading week of Jan 11-15. 

SOME of those short sales may be being done by MM and covered through Dark Pools, but not all of them. As you can see below, for the most recent date Dark Pool trading could only cover just over half.

For example, looking at the most recently available dark pool volume reporting (report on Jan 25 for week of Jan 11-15) shows that there were 44,126,023 shares that were traded for the week of Jan 11-15 and reported on January 25 in dark pools. FINRA daily short reports show that 78,338,060 shares were shorted that week (remember this is only what is reported to FINRA during normal market hours, so it could be far more).

 **So even if every dark pool transaction that week was a market maker covering a short position, it would only be a little over half -56% of the short volume. That is assuming that ALL dark pool volume is covering shorts by a MM.**  However, the transaction volume of Dark Pool trades contains short sales also (that are not reported by FINRA). On average short sales are about 37% of dark pool volume  [https://www.smu.edu/cox/Learning-Culture/Research-Papers/20191101\_Samadi](https://www.smu.edu/cox/Learning-Culture/Research-Papers/20191101_Samadi)

 \- they reason that since short volume is about half of daily volume, the short sales are actually buying volume and the non short sales are actually selling volume. This is just a lazy assumption, as it fits the theory behind the white paper. Correlation does not equal causation.

TLDR - The whole squeezemetric white paper is flawed because the author incorrectly assumed that the FINRA daily short report is based on data from dark pools and this in turn means that the daily short volume is actually Market Makers shorting a stock to provide liquidity and covering that short through dark pool share purchases. However, dark pool transactions are reported on a weekly basis, delayed by 5 weeks, and are not nearly enough shares to cover the shorts reported in the daily reports.",1,0,1615621140,joethejedi67

Each TRF provides a way for OTC and other off-exchange trading to be reported to FINRA, but they are not reporting ONLY off-exchange transactions. They are also reporting the transactions of the exchanges. Why would they be named as NASDAQ and NYSE if they did not include the exchange data also? Naming them that way would make no sense. There could just be one reporting facility for off-exchange reporting. 

It would also make no sense for FINRA to report daily and monthly off-exchange transactions only. What would be the purpose? This would mean that the short sales and volumes that occurred through the exchanges would not be reported daily or monthly at all. That argument is contradictory to the SEC and FINRA mandates to report short % of volume during trading hours.
