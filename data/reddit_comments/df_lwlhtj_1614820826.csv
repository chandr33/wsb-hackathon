2,gpm5pnt,"Yeah, I regret not going out above $300 and taking some profits at the time. I was expecting authorizations to start coming in real fast after that initial data from the UK dropped, but now it's looking like April just for the UK authorization and the stock is just gonna keep tanking in the short term while the rest of the market is getting hammered. There's no good short term news and the market seems to be pricing the stock as if Covid is gonna be over and done with by the time they get any authorizations done.",1,0,1614829317,Astray
