10,gpgzb1l,Don't be a stupid ape.  Monkeys feel bad about making a profit so never feel bad about making money. Reinvest it either in AMC or GME and pull it when it goes green. Reinvest again when and if they go down. I've been doing this since day one and have made a decent buck to reinvest. I have also done this with other stocks to reinvest again later. Profit is profit and if anyone tells you that you are stupid for doing this they are just wanting you to fail. Believe me everyone here is in this to make money not lose it.,3,0,1614726374,GidgetsDad
