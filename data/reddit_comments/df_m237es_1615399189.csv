3 RULES FOR SUCCESS IN STONKS:

Rule 1: Hold

Rule 2: Never buy when stonk go up. Instead, buy when stonk is dipped (ape look at floor and see bananas üçåüçåüçå)

Rule 3: Never sell when stonk go down. Instead, only sell when stonk go up 
(ape look up and see money ü¶çüëÄüí∞üí∞üí∞)

Note: yess, dis ees feenanshul avice, fuck melvin.
