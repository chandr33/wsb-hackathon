The price is steadily going up and still shows strong support, so it's relatively safe to assume it will still go up significantly. Of course, there are many factors to consider, so at any point in time things could reverse. So if you want to enjoy a fun ride invest only what you can lose, consider that money as lost and hold to your chair because in any way this goes, it is gonna be a wild ride.",1,0,1615382578,drestonxyz

60,gqg1ybd,"The squeeze will last atleast a week. You will easily mamage to get out at ~80% of the max price. Most reasonable is for everyone to hold till we reach the top and then sell on the way down. There is many DDs on this topic.

I am starting selling after the price is above 500k. If we hold till then, then 500k is easily doable.

Not financial advice.

61,gqg2urm,"I did read a lot of DD, believe me, but I didnÂ´t find any good answers to this particular question.

IMO:

Once the price actually goes to lets say 100k...the hedgies are just not able to buy back all the shorted stocks, its just way to costly. And when this happens for 1-2 days, people will start panicking and sell, then the price will drop very fast

Also...regarding the time this squeeze will be...many people are comparing this to VW squeeze, which was TOTALLY different, Porsche alone had 74% of the available stocks and some state in Germany had 20% so 94% of the available stocks were in the hands of TWO parties. 

With GME millions and millions of people have stocks, thatÂ´s why IMO the drop of the squeeze will happen way way faster because once people will start selling, more and more and more people will follow.",1,0,1615385265,Robin_Squeeze
