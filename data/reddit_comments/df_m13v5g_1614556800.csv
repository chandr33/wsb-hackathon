4,gqbc01g,If this thing crashes the market and multiple players need bailouts -&gt; I guess no one except GME holding apes will benefit from it,1,0,1615286570,Ingwerschlange
5,gqbc0qt,"Not really, the government has not required your tax dollars for the last hundred years or so, they just print it and tax you later, and they never actually tax back everything they spend.",1,0,1615286589,SohndesRheins
6,gqbc2eu,"Good point but unfortunately government doesn’t work like that.

Just wondering if anyone else has similar thought or had done any calculations to this effect.,1,0,1615290392,Fap2theBeat
