30,gqd6n9c,"I agree! Absolutely! Which is why it's important to inform them EXACTLY of what is going on here. 


The analogy I've been using is that your deadbeat brother in law asked you for some borrowed money for a business. You oblige. Later, you learn he gambled with it and won big. He calls you a sucker and an idiot for not being a suave gambler, like him, and flaunts his wealth in front of you. A few years pass, and he's broke, as he tried to gamble again and lost everything in the casino plus his lavish spending. He now asks you for borrowed money again. Would you fucking give it to him? SERIOUSLY?

In this story, you are you, plus everyone (the State, which is really just *supposed* to represent everyone - nevermind that it only represents plutocrats right now). The deadbeat brother in law who just can't resist gambling with borrowed money isn't JUST melvin capital - it's JP morgan, deutsche, shitadel, the DTCC, wall street, ALL OF THEM. Don't you realize what a fucking GOLDEN opportunity this is to well and truly fuck those people so hard they NEVER recover because their grandchildren will owe billions of dollars?
