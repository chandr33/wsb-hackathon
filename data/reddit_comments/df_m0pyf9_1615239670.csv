2,gq9c3it,"Hey everyone, I see concerns about trash memes and whatnot. Wanted to share some data with you.

First, I don't like trash memes either, but I also don't like being the arbiter of what's funny or not, so I tried to make a system that removed my judgment and was mostly based on user feedback. You'll notice the somewhat new comments it leaves when it says the feedback wasn't good enough. That's this script.

So, Memes along with two other flairs are culled by a script that runs every 5 minutes and checks if the upvote ratio and total upvotes as a function of time are high enough to consider it ""dank"". That can mean it has universal frontpage appeal and isn't very WSB, but it also means that most memes that nobody finds funny are auto removed.

Here's some data about the number of memes posted per day and whether they're approved or not.

[A zoomed out view including the popularity pop](https://i.gyazo.com/6565f3e0e205fe2c6978058a94ff176d.png)

[A zoomed in view of recently, labeled](https://i.gyazo.com/4c25521fd7385d9c41caf234e953cd0e.png)

You'll notice the total number of allowed meme posts is actually quite low and trending downward. There are many people mad at me every day for removing their hard-worked-on but not *that* funny memes. If you can deal with the frontpage usually having more memes than trading content (it always has), and just scroll down to the next page or two, there should almost always be the same old trading content you're used to.

Anyway, I hear ya, workin on it as always.",1,2,1615239673,zjz

where does a retail investor go when everything is red except for a meme stock thats up 10%? they pile into the only green they see of course

once the market begins moving up again, i reckon GME will get sold off as people move back into TSLA and other high flying tech that got smashed
