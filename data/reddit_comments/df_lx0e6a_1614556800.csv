0,gpk8rwv,OSTK has been dropping for weeks though. That's all I can see.,5,0,1614796289,Calathe
1,gpka2df,"In at $64.45 for a lil flyer at 1000 shares with paperhands on this one.  Earnings was good, they increased marketing to new homebuyers and that should hold up revenue.  been dropping on steady on reopening of physical retail, but they should be able to keep a good chunk of customers.   Since I'm gambling, I'm also taking a flyer on CLVS- might be worth a few tendies as well. D: RKT - paperhand out yesterday at $40, AMC still holding/praying, BBBY bagholder, NOK longterm, UVXY vix loss porn coming for addicts here and now OSTK and CLVS.   Have you heard of the color green?  I don't remember what it looks like......  Not financial advice, but my garden gnome says that orange crayons prevent scurvy - at first I just thought it was the voices in my head - but it works, I have no scurvy!!!!  Edit - I just lost $11.40 since buying - it's my best purchase this week by far!! Yea baby, hold steady",5,0,1614796845,shittt4brains
2,gpkapqa,So has everything else on the NASDAQ. I'm hoping this whole sell-off is an overreaction and short-lived,8,0,1614797127,Furnitureman80085
3,gpkkni6,"Interesting. I appreciate posting a different ticker than all the meme crap. If this were a few months ago, and I saw a huge drop like this, I'd probably buy some calls for sure. But this might be part of the broader tech sell off, and who knows when that shit will recover. Why did this sell off so badly since earnings? It looks like there's an SEC investigation, what's that about?",6,0,1614801417,thesmiter1

7,gpkvb94,Looking at their numbers OTSK collapsed well before covid and then went absolutely insane during covid to a 50% higher ATH. Their stock is tracking to assmining numbers due to their assmining investment so imo your faith in this company should be based on your faith that it doesn't go through another dump like 2017.,3,0,1614806035,topdangle
