With that said, understand your risk and buying in now is a high risk /high reward proposition. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad play but it could blow up in your face. In my opinion, it is not worth its current price from a purely fundamental value perspective. It is probably not worth its current price from a future growth perspective (although with Papa Cohen righting the ship, who knows!). However, if the shorts get into a bad position and have to buy back shares at any price, it could skyrocket way past its current value, at least temporarily, and if you sell at the right time you could make serious bank. 

I wouldn't put any money in that you cannot afford to lose. With that said, if it moons, my god what fun.

Positions: 60 shares left (I bought in back in the fall of last year, at around $12-14 and already realized life-changing gains on the last spike. Now I'm just along for the ride).",1,0,1615388132,Turokk8001
