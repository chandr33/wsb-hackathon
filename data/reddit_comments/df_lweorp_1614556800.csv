3,gpgxlyz,"They have casinos, but they are more like ‚Äúgaming centers‚Äù that haven‚Äôt even opened back up yet. Plus they have the barstool sports book app that you can do online gambling. You‚Äôre gonna get crushed buddy, this is going higher.",7,0,1614725548,razorteddy
4,gpgxs51,They made more in Q4 last year than Zoom. And Zoom is worth 5x as much. I think Penn is undervalued based on that tech comp.,3,0,1614725628,lvckpvck
5,gpgxxkl,"Plus they dropped all the way down to 4 bucks in March because of the shut down, so it was bound to bounce back and keep growing as the barstool Sportsbook is being launched in more states",3,0,1614725703,Bigsexy18
6,gpgy979,Up 1500% is misleading because PENN had no business being down to $6 in the first place. They don‚Äôt quite have the market share of DKNG but their competitive advantage is that they don‚Äôt need to spend on advertising. Love both PENN and DKNG,1,0,1614725859,mj9806

8,gpgyqh6,they werent down 1500%. they were down 80% followed by a 1500% increase while their EPS was down 1500% YoY,0,0,1614726093,SaltySeeds8
9,gpgz4d7,More and more states are legalizing gambling.  The Barstools Sportsbooks will be opening up after the pandemic and this can only boost revenues further.  I own zero PENN right now but will get back in soon.,1,0,1614726282,azzurri2017
10,gpgz87n,"Haha PENN lost 834M in 2020. Dont get me wrong... I think zoom is incredibly overvalued as well, and their recent performance is showing this. Having said that, PENNs EPS is down 1500% YoY meanwhile their stock is up 1500%... doesn't seem right to me.",0,0,1614726335,SaltySeeds8
11,gpgza17,I meant down to $6. Many people are extremely bullish on the sector this industry just gonna keep gaining momentum imo,1,0,1614726360,mj9806

13,gpgzysz,"I understand that they lost a significant amount of money in 2020 (843M to be exact), which represents a -1600% change in Net Income from the prior year. Yet, their stock is up 1500%. So, financially speaking, unless their growth rate is out of this world, this valuation makes 0 sense.

Edit: you mentioned they were a pandemic stock. But if this were true they wouldn‚Äôt have lost 800M in 2020",2,0,1614726701,SaltySeeds8

17,gph1kl2,You can use many stats to justify your value or lack there of. Sports gambling definitely has a bright future though.,1,0,1614727510,lvckpvck
18,gph24al,Again never said it doesn‚Äôt. But no one has given any hard facts to justify this valuation.,2,0,1614727788,SaltySeeds8
19,gph289e,These are my thoughts exactly,2,0,1614727843,SaltySeeds8
20,gph2iiv,"2020 wasn‚Äôt exactly a casino-friendly year.  It makes complete sense why those first two quarters were garbage.  However, investors are looking for future performance, not Q1/2 2020 performance, and online gambling will bring a stream of revenue that the company never had before the pandemic. That side of the company will only grow as online gambling becomes legal in more states, and that‚Äôs in addition to their proven track record of success running casinos.  You can claim that it‚Äôs overvalued for whatever reason, but if this new model is successful, then there‚Äôs a good chance you threw away money based on an opinion.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are plenty of overheated stocks where I‚Äôd want to make money placing puts on the cooldown, I just think there are plenty out there that don‚Äôt have a working business model and stand a much better chance of dropping down to whatever you perceive fair value to be.",1,0,1614727990,Outrageous-Win-9449

22,gph2r6e,So what stocks do you think are more overvalued that will have more of a cool down?,1,0,1614728114,SaltySeeds8
23,gph5wuc,"More immediate-term, I‚Äôm bearish on SOS, even though people are trying to squeeze it for God knows what reason.  Some of the overheated EVs I think are coming back to Earth already.  The weed stocks I think will definitely face a reckoning at some point considering they aren‚Äôt exactly mining precious metals.  I haven‚Äôt done enough research to single any one of them out, and I‚Äôm sure some will hold up better than others.  There‚Äôs also NNVC that I almost bought into today, seemed really cool at first but everything I read about them makes the company seem like a scam.",1,0,1614729727,Outrageous-Win-9449

28,gqgonh7,I invested at seven dollars a share when it was really down. I figure that with 33 millions stoolies just waiting to give money to anything barstool could help the value. They are only open in two states right now with the Sportsbook and everytime they add another state to their barstool sports book the money just increases. They just gained ten dollars on the Illinois announcement last night. They are projecting seven more states by years end. The brick and mortar isn‚Äôt even back up yet and when it does open they are going to make specific barstool sports areas in each casino. That will really bring out the fans. I don‚Äôt expect a ton of growth from here but it‚Äôs better than a savings account at this point. Little by little this will grow. Very little ad money being spent also,1,0,1615394697,Personal_Border
