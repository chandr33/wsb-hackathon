24,gpkah21,"How are you doing? Still holding? 

I paper handed hard. I was so confident going into it. 

$11.20 - 200 shares.

$10.52 - 300 shares.

$10.04 - 100 shares.

$9.86 - 100 shares.

$9.75 - 100 shares.

Then it just dove to below $9.50 and I sold everything at $9.45. 

Realized an $800 loss in about 3 hours. 

It didn't do anything that I thought it would. I was level headed for a while then I got emotional and fear came in. I bought RKT at the right time and sold far too soon (Made $100). Didn't want to make the same mistake twice. I completely doubted my position. *Sigh*

I learned a lot from this experience. I usually invest and don't trade but after watching RKT and seeing the similarities.... I jumped in. 

I usually sell at 2.5 percent down and look for 7.5 percent gains (or better with stop loss behind it). 

This was way out of the norm for me. I guess I'm officially retarded. 

I mean the volume has been insane so I keep waiting for it to pop. 10x the average daily volume already!? 

I'm actually considering getting back in again. Wash sale and all.",5,0,1614797021,GMEgotmehere

43,gpkc7yc,"OP says the 22nd is big earnings as it gets listed, holding till then. I would've averaged down alot more than I did but I full retard yolo'd almost all my account at it. 6.5k in if I out now lose 1000. But if it explodes on the 22nd I'll make a decent chunk.

Any stock over 1b market cap is almost guaranteed to go up over time (excluding failing companies that are terrible business models aka GME) 

I take comfort knowing that the max I'm gonna lose is 1k, stock can't drop lower than what it was before WSB touched it (realistically) and if I hold and get a huge payout, wurf... if I hold and lose 1k , it's the same as getting out right now lol. But it should go up indefinitely.
