Ummm... Thanks for the lesson, all that I know. That's why I chose a debit spread... limited risk...

Obviously you understand that selling a spread is different than exercising one leg of the spread (and I obviously can't exercise the other).

50,gpggp75,"What RH may end up doing is, at the end of the day Friday, try and sell your contracts since you don't have the capital. There are brokers that do handle spreads by buying and reselling shares, but generally charge a fee because they have to use their own money to do you a solid. I don't know if RH does that. They do try and sell your contracts for you, though, if you can't exercise.

How will they fuck you? Dude, all they can do is have shitty customer service and sometimes block buying new shares. They haven't affected options and if they block your ability to sell the contracts, then they're breaking the law. If you believe they're going to break the law, then you need to just pull out asap and move your money anyway.

51,gpgh03b,"Hey, someone who actually understands my question :) 

But yea, that's what I've been doing with other spreads and it works fine. 

Usually I do it with smaller cap stocks or tighter spreads - so the underlying contracts cost less or cost less to exercise. 

My issue this time is I don't have the funds to close them out one leg at a time &amp; selling the spread only gives me about half of it's value. 

From experience, we all know RH will fuck over their user with auto exercising the contracts.

I don't hold onto even ITM options because RHs close out will consistently fuck you.

That was my main question, if RH could assign the upper leg of my spread without considering the other leg.

60,gpgn1z2,"Again I do not know the RH.  Typically, brokers cannot close one leg of a spread on their own.  Only you can do that, if you have enough privilege and the margin to cover. Rules dictate that; as the margin requirements will be very different.  In your case, you already paid the maximum loss for the spread. If they split it, you will be exposed to limitless losses which without some big bucks in the account, will be kicked off by the algos. Your only risk is for RH to close the whole spread out early, which may limit your profits. That I cannot answer.

66,gpgt41b,"Bruh...Notice all the down votes you are getting?   Maybe an indication you should stop.  I didn't say you could exercise the short leg of the spread.  But here is the thing. If you exercise thr long leg of the spread to get the 100 shares. Rh will hold that as collateral for the short leg, meaning you won't be able to sell them. And you won't get the 500 until the short leg is exercised by the owner. Which won't happen at all unless it is in the money at expiration, which you have no guarantee of. So to collect your 500 you have to wait and take he risk the stock price goes back down.  Or buy back the short call, which reduces your max profit...to $200.
So no, your max profit if you exercise is NOT 500, because you can't control the exercise of the short leg.",0,0,1614723404,Ashpro2000

I pretty clearly indicated that I currently do not have the funds to exercise the lower leg, or buy back the short position. So your points, while valid are moot.
