Got distracted... By building a fort on the edge of the forrest cause I found out my first base was on an enclosed lake and not the ocean. Build a road linking them. Building a bridge over a creek I could walk through. Building a second fort over a tin source and troll spawn point building a highway system across the southern half of the island.

Then. Building a canal to Link the lake with the ocean and allowed ships to sail through.

Currently navigating the islands coast to begin finishing exploration...
