**What does ""fee"" rate mean?**
*A stock loan fee is the fee charged by a brokerage for borrowing shares. In iborrowdesk.com's case, the fee rate is expressed as an annualized percentage charged by Interactive Brokers.*

More info: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp
________________________________________________________
**What does ""available"" mean?**
*In order to borrow shares from a brokerage (iborrowdesk.com monitors Interactive Brokers), that brokerage needs shares available to lend out. Typically these belong to other clients of the firm, or they could belong to Interactive Brokers itself. Liquid large cap securities are typically ""easy"" to borrow. That is, brokerages have plenty of clients willing to lend out their shares. Some securities are in high demand - many people want to borrow them, or some may have restricted supply - few people willing to lend them. In either case the ""available"" number can be low*
