0,gq5wlow,I'm a sucker b/c I bought $100K worth at 270...woops. i do think this hit the provided PTs or exceed them though. All good,1,0,1615167205,DesperateForDD
1,gqeuyrz,Thanks for the updates! I followed your initial DD and did pretty well. Exited a bit early but profit is profit. The premiums on the options are expensive but do you think something like 4/16 300C is likely?,1,0,1615350316,bravo_company

3,gqiqchn,"Whatâ€™s the bear case? Always important to assess in the upside / downside. 

Are their sales for this year a lock bc of contracts even though they are running behind MRNA/PFE/JNJ? What if there is no resurgence in covid cases after this summer? What if Sanofiâ€™s flu shot retains its market share (could it?)? 

Im definitely not sharp on this space but just curious how you think about the downside risk (I saw the US bought 100m more JNJ vaccines this week).",1,0,1615427264,gang_green89
4,gqj8klt,"Top risk in my view is around execution. They're an inexperienced company and are now running a massive, international manufacturing operation, and dealing with multiple regulatory agencies simultaneously, which is not trivial. With that said, they claim to still be on track to hit their production targets according the comments in their earnings call. Either way, they're going to be a bit slower than MRNA/PFE/JNJ at every step of the way, and we've seen that so far. 

Sars-Cov2 is going to be another endemic coronavirus and I think that we're going to see significant efforts go into booster campaigns for the foreseeable future due to 1) unknowns about durability of protection 2) emergence of new variants and 3) poor immunological memory in elderly/immunocompromised. 

Vaccination rates in low risk groups will probably drop off over the next 2-4 years however I think there will still be a pretty significant cohort of people who want to get boosters to keep high risk family/friends safe. As a result, I think we see a lot of boosting efforts going on for the next few years and I think NVAX is in the best position to take advantage of that due to the reasons I outlined in the post. 

With respect to boosters, the risk my thesis around NVAX's positioning is that 1) mRNA boosters work perfectly fine at lower doses and can be multiplexed and 2) that there is no significant side effect profile. In that case, NVAX is sharing, rather than dominating the booster market and likely loses some pricing power.",1,0,1615437551,Upstairs_Speech
5,gqj8x2g,"Yeah I think the 4/16 $300s will work if they execute over the next couple of week. You could buy spreads to lower the premium, which is something I've been doing with some success",1,0,1615437764,Upstairs_Speech

10,gqmjyng,"OP - thanks! I had been all over Novavax, Moderna, Inovio (still holding INO) but was not smart in when I sold and bought. 

Was looking at Novavax when you posted and ended up buying 25 shares at $165 range. Definately should have bought more around $159 but didn't have any cash and everything was red so didn't dare. 

Today's after market was sweet. Being at such a low market cap vs Moderna makes me.think $300-$400 is easily reachable. 

So thanks for this post, will set a stop limit order and be assure to remain in black",1,0,1615502127,wtf-am-I-doing-69
