1,gqfs5u7,"I PANIK sold GME for a small profit over break even. My constitution was weak. My risk tolerance is lower since I lost 20% of my net worth last year on FDs.

To those of you that held I applaud you.

Let‚Äôs make sure that the Hedge Funds are the ones holding the bag this time. I know it‚Äôs not possible but I want as many of you apes to make it out safely as possible.

Good luck and god speed. Also, please let me know when you all start selling so I can buy some cheap puts.",1,0,1615378688,PRPLcoffin

SO whenever you get scared and your favourite diamond hand stock goes red for a few minutes then grab you cajones and wait... Why sell for a loss - did GME not teach us anything?
