2,gqh30fc,Donâ€™t try and time the market - if you sell and it shoots up youâ€™ll feel worse than dealing with the loss - which you can average down to extend profits on the way up,5,0,1615399948,Millennialwisdom

14,gqh3njv,"in my experience trying to time the market (especially one this volatile) is not a good idea. its best to DCA down during a dip and have a sell number in mind that you will be happy with. It is extremely difficult to time the top or bottom of any stock movement. I have a feeling this is about GME. I am not an Fin Advis, but this thing is really making waves across the globe. My position is hold.",2,0,1615400187,Johnny_B_Reddit
