&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Oh absolutely. Just follow the $$ rules if you are going to post. I’ve had tons of options expire worthless and a handful of 10 baggers. 

Question: So I've seen people talk about options expiring worthless... I'm using TD, and they tell me that when an option expires they auto-exercise. So I either have to sell the option beforehand, or have enough cash on hand to make the purchase. So how do they ""expire worthless""? 

My option is a $4 call that expires tomorrow. Unless something drastic happens, NOK is never going to hit $4 by EOD tomorrow. Will it still exercise at the $4 price, the current price? Or should nothing happen because it didn't hit the strike price? I've looked through the internet and through their own help section but never got a clear answer.
