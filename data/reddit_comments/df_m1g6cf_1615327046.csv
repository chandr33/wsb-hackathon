I'm looking at these 300$ call options. So does that mean if I purchase a contract for March 12th which is 1778$ at the moment, does that mean if it hits 300$ I can choose to exercise my contract or sell the entire thing which would be 100 shares at 300$?

Does that also mean the most I can lose is only my initial 1778$ spent on the contract?",-4,0,1615327082,Spageddi
