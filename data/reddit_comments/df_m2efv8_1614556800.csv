Left for lunch on a high. Then on my way back is when the dip hot. I felt like i was going to lose my lunch and shit my pants at the same time. After the first half and the price still dropped my hands were shaking as i hovered over the sell button. The voice of fear kept saying i could still save some profits.

Before i started work again, i just looked at some numbers for analysis and realized that it was an unusually larger yet round number of a volume that sold. I also checked amc and saw the same pattern and started smelling the fish. Reasoning came back and i remembered my fellow apes talking about potential dirty tactics to induce panic selling. Once i saw the bounce back and a large green volume i knew my ape brothers weren't falling for it so why should I? 

I remembered the goal and that i had diamond hands and helped my stocks until the end which still was a green day and I'm proud to say i stayed retarded. Plus, it distracted me from my real problems while maintaining the ups and downs just with more colors.",15,0,1615427653,Psypho_Diaz

Right in the middle of winding down a 10,000 ft mountain road the stock dropped. Next 30 minutes I had call of the void to yeet myself over that cliff, just like this lovely stock did.

BUT NO. I didn't. I held strong. Got myself a delicious breakfast burrito at the bottom with my RKT gains, and rest of the day I ate a nice burrito and ran through about 2 lighters worth of cigarettes as I calmed myself down from that amazing journey.

Then I remembered what you retards said. To hold. So I did. Despite shaking uncontrollably and having every terrible scenario run through my head, I held... and it shot back up. It was like a movie. It was a line on a screen, yet it filled me with more exhilaration than any piece of media ever has.
