HF borrow x amount of depleted shares 

HF short attack with all they got

Triggered a bunch of stop losses along the way causing it free fall tom petty style 

Retards tell each other to hold, don't panic sell and take your stop losses off, (you can be retarded,  but having stop losses is going full retard, and you know what they say simple jack)

Wsb rallies like a mofo, fucking slams diamond üíé hands down and declares these apes are not going anywhere. 

Yes or no to my summary. Just need verification.
