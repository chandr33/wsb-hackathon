20,gpng1i2,"**SUMMARY OF GME SHORT INCLUDING KEY DATES AND RESOURCES**

If you're here for the short...

FINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.

FINRA SI Reporting Schedule

[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

Next time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).

You find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0)

There are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to this next time I post.

Right now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.

Now they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when the calls come up, they must again either pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.

If the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, the short is more than on - it's growing, hold. If it's the same, hold. If it's &lt; 20% **on every site**, things get real questionable imo.

SI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.

At the moment, the price has been very stable, which is excellent. And today isn't likely to be a big key event date, it's likely that shorters aren't buying yet, waiting longer before they MUST collect. So a flat day like today is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be similar. We may even see a dip. Anything below &lt; $120 is a discount imo (considering that has been our floor for 3 days now). At 45% SI, all seriousness, I believe $500+ is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.

This is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating. I also like the stock.

Feel free to edit, expand, and share. Just be sure to include your resources.
