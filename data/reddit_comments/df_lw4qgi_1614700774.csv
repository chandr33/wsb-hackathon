20,gpfcur8,"I know this has been stated, but I’d like to reiterate. All other tickets being pumped are a distraction. Just the fact that they are talking about an RKT short squeeze in the mainstream media is all you need to know. If they are broadcasting it to the masses, there is a reason. They want everyone to see it, they don’t actually want us making money, they would never be giving us beneficial information like that. Keep to your guns boys and girls, hold your shit, don’t day trade, and be patient. Can’t wait to rendezvous on the moon with all of you!!! 🚀",11,0,1614700782,LukaLeja
