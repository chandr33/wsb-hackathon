22,gq9gvgq,"Cohen's play is that the big e-retailers (Amazon) are actually a bit shit. And he's 100% right. I use Amazon pretty regularly and it's a pain in the dick. The whole last year I was trying to buy a DS4 (allowances made for pandemic shortages) and the absolute bollocks it's search algorithm throws at me, for what is an incredibly refined search request, is off putting. Tons of third party rip-offs, controllers for other consoles (in the first 20 search results) and what seem to be legitimately illegal knock offs littered my results. And that's not even the actually bad part, which is that companies can swap one product (and it's reviews) for another. This is incredibly common and undermines the credibility of Amazon as a online storefront/marketplace. I honestly think that specialised online retailers are the future, I don't think Amazon's going anywhere but I do think there's a lot of room for specialised e-retailers to grab market share by offering a better shopping experience and (far) better curation of the products sold.

It doesn't really matter what this sub of retards says or does in terms of following gmes Twitter or buying a game there because either GameStop can offer a better service than Amazon or they can't and as far as I'm concerned Cohen has the pedigree and the balls to do it.

GameStop was never a $4 stock, that was bullshit and it's not a fucking $11 price target stock either. Why the cuntballs are still pricing it there...well I think we all know what that's about, but gme today, at around 200, is a much fairer valuation than fucking 4 ever was.",2,0,1615241873,Lazybopazy

every industry is crowded, espeically if its a successful industy.

sure you can throw people down for buying in to this idea, but as long as they have held they are just fine.  

Stocks are never about profit, stock is about the value of the company, and elements of value can be subjective.

The fact the a company with such ""retail loyalty"" for a retail company that is moving from Brick and mortar (crowded, outdated, expensive) to E-commerce which say is overcowdard is kinda dumb cuz its the internet... like your grandma could have a website...

It is better for the loyal retailed to buy stonks, after all when they do buy merchandise they would be in effect buying from their store.

If you weren’t holding or just debating me for fun you would acknowledge that. It’s deep value at $5. At $150 it’s pure hype. The short squeeze stuff is real but trying to justify this as a legitimate business choice is pure self delusion.
