3,gqd50mo,I guess one argument that could be made is that WSB is the new enforcer in town when it comes to hedgie’s excessively shorting stocks. While they can excessively short there are enough retail traders taking the opposite position looking for a short squeeze.,51,0,1615318974,Skeewampus
4,gqd6jpn,So basically they are going to let us fight in the streets,29,0,1615319664,DelTacoSupreme1
5,gqd6oj1,This is true. The problem is we only really have enough capital to squeeze one stock at a time. I guess I just buy the stonks with the best memes,22,0,1615319723,stickmanmob
6,gqd6ouo,Yup. With information about all of this being mostly readily accessible the old way of doing things is over. It may take them a minute to get it but the game has changed.,10,0,1615319727,NinjaRage83
7,gqd89bf,"Good, This is the way. This is what we actually want. Any regulations would take us years to overcome, while large institutions would find a way around them within months.",17,0,1615320429,jaybaird05

12,gqdfy9y,Wasn't this predictable already. SEC is own by the HF. HF will be lining their pocket after leaving their SEC position. Who the fuck care about us.,3,0,1615323838,Only_Reasonable
13,gqdgskl,"This is bittersweet in a way. On one hand we do NOT need new regulations imposed on retail traders. On the other hand, it sounds like the SEC is just ignoring the blatant manipulation caused by the Hedge Funds/MMs.

It's fucking retarded that regulations for retail traders were even brought up in the first place. We're not manipulating shit. We don't have the coordination or the capital to criminally manipulate the market. All the politicians during the House Committee hearing last month saying that retail traders need new regulations to protect them and the market from themselves are fucking idiots. The SEC just needs to enforce laws that are already there against Shitadel and friends, but they won't do that until they're broke and/or out of favor with the rest of the financial world.",10,0,1615324208,EazyNeva

27,gqef2is,"Regulations to ""protect"" people are almost never for that purpose and almost always to keep people out of markets.
