7,gqizese,Honestly? It’s so fucking cheap it just might actually work. Even if it hit $4 again it’d be a nice little return. Buy a nice dinner or something. Why’d they crash in the first place?,2,0,1615432054,Narkanin

29,gqjvckj,"My thesis is that as a pandemic-hit stock, one the pandemic ends it'll rise back up to the $2-$3 range where it was a bit more than a year ago. I've got 10,000 shares.

They're good planes, and rich assholes are going to want to avoid commercial fluffing more than ever once the pandemic wraps up, which should drive higher business jet sales.

Also, all the $GME trillionaires will need jets to buy, too.",1,0,1615451932,agtmadcat
