3,gqidz2i,"Those that exist and support the bull thesis immensely. They exist. I see from my own reading that the fundamentals are a NO BRAINER AT THIS PRICE POINT. However, I feel it‚Äôs optimists who trust the fundamentals as bears become put off by past market actions. Those fools thought the market was going to crash last autumn. They just love saying things will fall. It like is sexy for them. But I need, personally, really educated ammo that I can throw to a typical bear. The goal for this post is to share distilled info so that your average boomer-thinking Gen z and millennial, who isn‚Äôt as much an optimist, will read this and think, hmm ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm not smarter than these yolo‚Äôing guys my age‚Äù. And the boomers thinking ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm not smarter than these much more healthy and better looking people who are taking my money five ways to Sunday‚Äù",2,0,1615420733,Right_Instance7991

7,gqifj87,there are no fundamentals that bears will accept for GME. which is probably fair. and they get rabid if you even bring them up.,3,0,1615421561,xXxCOVIDfan420xXx
8,gqifpp5,"Okay, I'm genuinely not trying to shill or spread FUD here. I just want to understand the math. I keep reading posts that the ""math"" gets us to $100k per share - I get the squeeze concept, but how would we get that money/where would it come from?     
I'm looking at Yahoo finance with GME float of 45.16m shares (would shares outstanding be more appropriate? Then it's 69.75m shares). We know institutional ownership is more than 100% of float, but let's just go with a scenario where 100% of shares sell at 100k.  So that's 45.16m shares. If those shares were sold at 100k, that would be.... 4,516,000,000,000 or $4.5T?? Where is $4.5T going to come from? What I googled was the HF industry has about a total capital of $3.6T. Citadel has 35b and Melvin has 12b. Where is the rest coming from? I don't think the DTCC is just going to liquidate its assets to pay up right? Please help me understand.",8,0,1615421657,LeKiwi

15,gqihlq2,"Math??? Dont do that. Just upvote the guys that say $500K per share isn‚Äôt a meme (even though that would put the total valuation of GME at over 20 trillion, possibly even within spitting distance of the total national debt).",5,0,1615422654,Liftthatbox
16,gqihphx,"I'm afraid he is right.  Currently Gamestop isn't worth more than $45 per share (and that is being really generous) if you are just looking at the business in it's current state. Quick, basic summary. Gamestop was shorted and was meant to go bankrupt so the shorts never had to cover (much like Toys r us). Gamestop survived, made sales at the right time, has a new board with a track record. The future looks brighter. Hedge Funds are still shorting and their algorithms are not written for this type of thing (as we witnessed today) as they are  üåàüêª who don't understand that people spend their time playing games and not just always hustling for money. That there are people that will happily lose $10,000 as it might as well be $1000 for all it matters in a persons life.

Gamestop might be worth $1000 a share (once all the shenanigans have finished with the HFs) in 2 years time if Papa Cohen can take us to the promised land. But right at the moment, there are market forces and psychological concepts at play that no one fully understands, that means no one can pick a value for Gamestop and that leads to all the volatility.

The stock market is always a tug of war between what a company is actually worth with how profitable it is and the promise of what a company might one day be worth.",1,0,1615422711,akareil
17,gqihr7d,Doesn‚Äôt the DTCC have something like 60T? And we need 4.,2,0,1615422738,atcgriffin
18,gqihy9v,"Oh don‚Äôt get me started. January, I had a different option. I had a $67c exp March. I tried selling but the insane volatility had be sweating my hands as the price kept dropping or increasing So I held on. Then as it dropped I thought I could play the weed stocks, got burned 50/50 but stayed in gme. Then got the 900c and a couple other calls. Sold those like a paper handed noob the day before the run up but kept the 900c 2023 call. It‚Äôs at 9.9k now but was at 17k earlier till the massive drop. Not worried, and like I have time. But overall, this thing is undervalued I think even at 250",2,0,1615422844,Right_Instance7991
19,gqii3cv,It‚Äôs pretty good tbh. Because the long exp it doesn‚Äôt drop insanely when price drops and so psychology it‚Äôs allows me to see more level headed and I‚Äôm still EXTREMELY bullish. Probably more than before,2,0,1615422920,Right_Instance7991
20,gqii8mo,Also it was 17k at today‚Äôs peak but I was getting high on some real good Ganja (it‚Äôs legal in NJ you SEC intern brats!) and took a break from the chart. I wouldn‚Äôt have sold anyway let‚Äôs be honest. I use Robinhood and need to be judicial when I sell because they take FOREVER to complete an order. I want to sell and buy shares when the time is right,1,0,1615422999,Right_Instance7991
21,gqiic47,"I feel ya. I paper handed 1/29 60c x25 for 100k right before it would have made me a millionaire. Then proceeded to lose the 100k on far too aggressive calls. Working from the ground up again with a 90 day trading ban now. Opening a second brokerage account too rn. Things just became much more difficult, but I ain't no bitch.",2,0,1615423051,DeadSol
22,gqiigr6,Yeah the DTCC 60trillion INSURANCE will more than cover for them. Like I‚Äôm not worried for that. I worry about their fuckery but not if they can or can‚Äôt afford it. They can. This is a pebble in a pond even if it reacher trillions,2,0,1615423121,Right_Instance7991
23,gqiihpu,From what I'm finding on the wikipedia page. DTCC has ~47T total assets as of 2018. I don't think the DTCC can just liquidate that though right?,2,0,1615423136,LeKiwi
