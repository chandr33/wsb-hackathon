It will recover but the bears get to have their way for a while. I don't think it will last long, the end of covid will spur growth once again.",7,0,1614880920,kittensNclaws

5,gpoftj4,"Ill be honest im not the most experienced investor, only in the game since the beginning of this year.
My 2 cents, stocks go up and down, its normal. If you donâ€™t need this money right now just leave it, check on it once a week, in a few month you will be back hopefully. But buying the dip is one of the biggest lessons I learned. If you get excited and jump on a hype train, know that others doing that too which will boost the stock up artificially. Then it will go down for sometime for a correction, this is the right time to double down if you like the stock, thats how you will lower your cost average down from $20 to lets say $13. Thats how you increase your chances to be profitable. But of course only do this if you think this stock is a keeper longer term. Hopefully that helps brother.",8,0,1614881241,Sua_Capoeira

Just some ideas. It does look shorted a bit also.",2,0,1614884819,Big-Kitty-75
