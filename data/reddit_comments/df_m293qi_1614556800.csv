11,gqhw62m,"Oh for sure, I plan on stopping, but dude, Wyoming is desolate.  There's a town maybe every 150 miles, the weather always sucks, and some of the rest stop/gas station areas don't have WiFi.  I loathe driving through that state.  Plus I80 Wyoming is NOT a safe road in the winter.  So I gotta worry about my driving safety AND my potential tendies.  Gonna be a stressful day lol",1,0,1615412150,ILoveLearningThings
12,gqhw8jq,"For myself: I would divide up the shares at a few varying sell limits. There's no reason they all have to go at the same price.

Im going to be traveling soon myself to the North Pole (literally) and the flight will not jabe wifi. I'll be setting a number of limits first.",1,0,1615412179,IronGeek83
13,gqhwg9c,"(I know the diamond hand apes are gonna skull fuck me for saying this).  But I was thinking of selling one off at 400, then 500, 700, so forth.  That way, if it spikes and tanks again, I've gotten ALL of my investment back, and I'll still be sitting on ""free"" money.  I think this is a very good idea, my retarded friend.",1,0,1615412272,ILoveLearningThings

18,gqhx1o0,"Yeah I think this is the safe bet.  I'll set 5 of my 20 shares at high sell limits, so if it does peak, I'll have a nice chunk of cash to reinvest, and still hold 15 shares.  I like where your heads at friend.",1,0,1615412535,ILoveLearningThings
