15,gqah77c,"My argument against that is that this is a new stock. Only been trading for like 6 months since IPO. No one knows what ""price in"" means here because there is not enough history. The analyst (not that they know shit) continue increasing their target prices, highest ive seen is $35 from $25 a few weeks ago.  All im saying is that they are aggressively  growing, blowing out earnings, not been trading long and in a super hot field. This current market trades on what could be, not what is.

17,gqahg44,Im from Houston and the lines outside for merchandise anytime our sport teams get anywhere in the playoffs get insane!!! That being said I don't think we will have any long lines here for awhile....so I'd say buy puts. But if they are expanding into other cities/states then they will have the long lines we once did so buy calls. I guess I'm saying follow the trends on where they are opening and if the sports teams around are good then they will boom cuz they are on top of the playoff merchandise like nobody else,2,0,1615261501,killmeplease1979

45,gqavdmo,"Maybe you are right.

The way I was seeing it, the strike price seemed reasonable to hit, even the break even price, but not sure much after that, so it'd be a bet for likely quite little return if any. Shares on this look like a better bet to me at this point, but it's slow.

Now I am new to options so I tend to not factor the premium going up as you suggested, maybe with that it makes it indeed more interesting.
