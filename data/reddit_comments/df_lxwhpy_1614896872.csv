This is WSB, no one exercises their options, hence why the ""gamma squeeze"" never happens. Everyone posting +800% options are taking the money and never buying the shares. This and every retard using margin is why GME crabs for weeks and never blasts off.

26,gpphrj1,"But a lot of market makers sell contracts that aren't naked per say but aren't fully covered. From what I understand they remain delta neutral, so if the delta is at .7 they hold 70 shares for example. If the delta increases, they automatically buy more shares. The squeeze doesn't happen when the options end in the money, rather when the delta and/or gamma on the options increases and the market makers hedge by fully covering the options that were partially naked.

Giants in the playground are having their fun, and we're all just side courses.  


There's other examples from across the week. When the price was struggling to breach 116 on Tuesday in afterhours, an automated player was buying exactly one stock per second at 118.18 for exactly 3 minutes. It was enough to tip the 5 and 15 minute candles green, and triggered buying after that to sustain the price up.
