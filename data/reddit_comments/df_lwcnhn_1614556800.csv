1,gpgl3cf,Shoulda bought market price instead of good for day.,1,0,1614719856,ercanbas
2,gpgl6ha,Both of those options opened at a price that was higher than your order price so your order never filled. Tough break since RKT mooned today. Both of those options were well above $10 at close.,7,0,1614719893,McPowPow
3,gpglat6,You had a limit that didn’t hit I assume.,1,0,1614719943,Triposer
4,gpglc63,Would have printed but that 3/5 expiration was a bad idea sir,1,0,1614719960,omgdood
5,gpglxnf,It didn't execute. Watch your options closely.  If the stock is running it won't execute. You have a price limit that was likely passed pretty quickly.,2,0,1614720212,anthony451000
6,gpgn284,"By the time the market opened, the price for that option was well above what you bid.",3,0,1614720707,lxnch50
7,gpgn2h2,"Yes, as others noted, you set as a Limit Buy at $1.26 for the $24.5 strike.  Yesterday's close was at $1.27 and it opened today at $2.91.  Your order would only be filled if it hit $1.26 or lower as with any Limit Buy order (options or otherwise).  Afterhours trading opens at 8AM Eastern which is moot since the previous close was a penny higher than your Limit Price.",4,0,1614720709,Tpat75

File this under the ""Hard Lessons Learned"" folder.",5,0,1614721751,Due_Soft4144
9,gpgqae7,Note the instinct the grab it tho... on paper you made a good trade. Be careful once you get them the price can go up and down rapidly. Have an exit strategy. Only play $ you can afford to lose.,2,0,1614722115,Historical_Emu5364
10,gpgs4wx,Anyone got a recommendation for a good app to trade options with? I’m in europe and would love to have gone to Robinhood (#SorryNotSorry) for options but I can’t and idk what to look into,1,0,1614722950,Pantomius
11,gpgsdjo,This happened to me as well I tried to pick up a 30c 3/5 buy last night after hrs that never filled today.  Crazy thinking bout how close it was to being on board today’s action.  Would have been my first call!,1,0,1614723061,gruhlman
