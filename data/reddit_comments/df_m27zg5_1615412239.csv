Tendies flow across the lands

Do you think I'll ever sell?

Answer's no and time won't tell

DFV, of course he's in

Much to Melvin Cap's chagrin

How do we board this rocket now?

Just click buy, no sell - that's how

Your country holds, you're in the game? 

The U.S. too, we are the same

The moon - it waves as we fly past

The tendies heavily amassed

Our rocket ship is laden full

Us apes further from grav'ty's pull

Accelerating towards the 'c'

dumb apes and relativity
