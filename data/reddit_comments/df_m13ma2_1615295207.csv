10,gqbqv2t,"&gt; GME is still in a dire situation and its market cap does not mean anything as it is purely a bet on a short squeeze. 

You... really haven't researched this company at all, have you? There are 477m in assets (Cash) and  141m in debt, not to mention over 1b in inventory.

Even if they make not one penny (during a console release cycle, LOL) they can reasonably last 5 years.",1,0,1615297313,Lanessar

But you didn't even have these numbers, and said it would be $5 a share.

I'm done with this particular conversation, since all you have are strawman arguments and not even a vague clue about the company.

When you want to start a real conversation, read analyst DD (not here) and come back with some actual discussion points.",1,0,1615300972,Lanessar

Listen, stocks don’t really trade on fundamentals like they used too. You can either cry about the fourth turning and it’s affect on market trading. Or you can play some catch up. If you identify a momentum or hype stock you can stay on the station and continue grinding out your measly returns during its run up. Alternatively, you could learn how to catch hype trains and make serious money. Get with the times boomer.",1,0,1615329406,degenterate

The last time GME hit 450 it did it in like 2 days. When it happens, it happens fast, it will happen right before your very own eyes. Be patient and hold, this will hit 1000$ +.
