5,gqgye93,"To anyone who thinks this is us losing a whale or two - whales are not stupid enough to try sell everything off at once and drive down the price that they can get. Whales taking profits will sell some shares here and some share there so that they can keep the price steady. They know if they drop a massive sell order, the price will drop dramatically before that sell order is filled. This is the hedgies final(ish) stance.

The volume they just dropped is less than the volume on Monday that moved the price from 160 to 170. They just are dropping dummy big sale orders to drive the price down.",16,0,1615398326,thehumangenius01
