Honestly this is a wild ride but at this point it's tough to let myself go 'all in' on the optimism because while I'm a smooth brain I'm thinking 10 steps ahead, and the more attention it receives and the more damage this causes to the people with influence the higher the chances we see even more restrictions ""for our benefit"".
