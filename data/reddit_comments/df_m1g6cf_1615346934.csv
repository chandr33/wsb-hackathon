79,gqepl6u,"I’ve been told that years ago too. I guess life might have worked out better sooner if I had some kind of direction sooner.

WSB and the stock market feels like the most direction I’ve ever had in my life. School didn’t show me the way, my parents didn’t show me the way, and I feel my parents don’t really care, or just gave up on me.

Not that I’m their actual responsibility anymore. I’m just damn lucky they’ve given me an extra 7+ years to live mostly free, and now for a HELL of a lot less than market prices.

I just have to pay for my own food (most of it, I’m not prohibited from eating anything they buy) and pay a couple of utility bills, which is instead of rent, but I guess that’s sort of rent.

My step dad is a crazy right-wing conspiracy theorist, and I’m scared what he might try to do, I just want my own freedom to live where I went and not depend on anyone else.

I’d also LOVE to prove my family wrong, wrong that I’m a lost cause (there’s no way they don’t think that about me) and prove them wrong that working and having a tight budget and settling for less in life is the only option.

My next stimulus is definitely going right into the stock market, putting it into my savings won’t help me that much.

I am much more cautious about missing work now, and I’m trying to cut back on the Starbucks and avocado toast ☕️🥑
