6,gppkmff,"Yes, the federal funds rate hasn't changed. It's speculation that it will change. Still mortgage rates are calculated using input from 10year T-notes, and that has been skyrocketing. Also (I'm paraphrasing here so this could be somewhat inaccurate) but apparently the increase in 10year rates is the fastest these rates have risen in decades. That's why the market is freaking out right now.",6,0,1614898769,straightCrimpin

SPY, QQQ, and all the major indicies topped on Feb 19th and Feb 20th 2020.

WFC closed Feb 19th 2020 at $47.09, closed the 20th at $47.34.

All the other major banks have reached or surpassed the levels they were at BEFORE THE MARKET SHIT ITSELF STARTING ON FEBRUARY 19th 2020, WFC has not.

For context 4.2% on SPY since the most recent high on Feb 16th. The market started shitting itself in Feb and anyone who doesn't realize that wasn't trading at the time and doesn't understand what it feels like to go through a 12% drawdown on the worlds most popular ETF in 2 fucking weeks.

The stock literally is up almost 100% since the pandemic started again in March. 

Wide spread circuit breakers started on March 9th. There was 3, all in March not February. 

Spy dropped fucking 10% in an hour on March 9th, worse than all of February combined.

How can you do dd pandemic related when you don‚Äôt even know when the pandemic started, or when the worse drop off was.

44,gppqalj,"In case anyone see's u/severedconnect stupid comment chain and gets lost going down the rabbit hole of his general retardation let me explain for you the opportunity here.  


JPM, WFC, C, and BAC are the major American banks. Before the market topped on Feb 19th-Feb 20th 2020, all 4 of those banks were trading at the following prices:  


* JPM Closed @ 137.49 on Feb 19th '20. Today's closing price = 150.65 up by 9.6%.
* BAC Closed @ 34.72 on Feb 19th '20. Today's closing price = $36.53 up by 5.2%
* C closed @ 78.05 on Feb 19th '20. Today's closing price = $69.84 down by 11%
* WFC closed @ $47.09 on Feb 19th '20. Today's closing price = $37.19 down by 21%

  
The point here is that if we use last years price as a yardstick and compare the banks, we can see that WFC is the furthest below from it's 1 year ago price. If we assume that banks are on the rise, and we see that 2 of the 4 have surpassed their 1 year ago price already we see opportunity to say ""Hey, if I buy WFC options, targeting their 1 year ago price, how much money would I make if they get there"". And like I said in the OP, you'd get multi-baggers because the options are freaking cheap.",14,0,1614901589,straightCrimpin
