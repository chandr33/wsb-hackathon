Instead, I bought another share the other day. I know 3 shares isn’t impressive but I’m a single mom and didn’t want to gamble what I couldn’t lose. 

Can’t exactly afford a lambo,  but maybe I’ll get my daughter one of those cool electric lambos with my tendies. Found one for $180 on Amazon, my tendies already pay for that.
