25,gqh1ovh,"&gt;If you're 20B in the hole shorting then at this point your only options

Not sure why we should assume these entities didn't also stock the fuck up on shares in the $40-60 range which they are now dumping the price with (or other entities that have been holding for even longer).

Also not sure why they would be $20B in the hole when you could literally buy every Gamestop share at the current price for less than that. They would only be $20B in the hole if they *actually bought* every single share for like $350, but why wouldn't they have just closed their shorts at $50 instead of $350?",2,0,1615399442,nelisan
