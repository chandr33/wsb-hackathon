1,gq9fy1i,"I'll be honest, being on pc so long, I got spoiled by digital games, now I hate having physical games to swap, I'm too lazy, and I like having more room in my room. but for people who 'are fucking lucky enough to' have homes, physical is pretty nice


also, if steam was a stonk, I'd buy the hell out of it",7,0,1615241438,Boxeater-007

3,gq9g9aj,"Sometimes a well placed physical store can lead to browsing and impulse purchases. I know recently I decided to drop by GameStop next to a place I picked up dinner and bought a $60 game I wasnt going to purchase virtually. 

I also have the ability to bring the game to my friends house and play.",4,0,1615241584,Cazking

Edit: these guys need someone to help them with e-commerce. I would have bought more stuff...if only they'd go through some kind of digital transformation, they might have a bright future.",3,0,1615241926,JVFL

10,gq9huci,"I think if they tried a program where customers could rent the used inventory they have it would go a long way towards their profitability, like make it a subscription service tier of their current power up rewards program; that way they're monetizing inventory they're currently holding. A lot of people would be all about that, imo. I know I'd be stoked to rent a game I am on the fence about to decide whether I want to buy it.",1,0,1615242334,Smvvgy805

So guess what i'm gonna get when the PS6 comes out? The disk version.... so I can play my PS4, PS5, and PS6 disks.

And guess what i'm gonna get when the PS7 comes out?

Yup.... disk version.",1,0,1615246113,TimsKillerRabbit

23,gqa83ww,"Make it a tiered program too, from just a straight across rental up to like a VIP tier where at the end of the term we can keep a game of (x) value, or whatever? It would be a solid revenue stream that they would be able to create with very little effort, like, every store has  a bunch of used inventory just lurking on-site. Just have legal draw up rental agreement contracts and tos type and utilize the stores inventory logistics to rent titles. Idk why they haven't thought of this, they can even place 'call options' on newer, popular titles so they'll eliminate fomo on potentially losing a sale, like, if someone came in and wanted to buy the used copy and it was the last one, the store could exercise their option and reclaim it from the current renter.",1,0,1615256318,Smvvgy805
24,gqa8z89,"I was that way too, but then I started realizing that some games I had bought digitally, once I finished them (or decided I didn‚Äôt even like it enough to finish it) I was likely never going to play them again. And at that point, I can‚Äôt return it, can‚Äôt trade it in, can‚Äôt sell it on eBay/Craigslist/etc, can‚Äôt even let a friend borrow it. 

So I‚Äôve started buying more physical games lately, cause there‚Äôs some games that I want to play through once, but know that‚Äôs likely the full extent of enjoyment I‚Äôll get out of the game. And once I‚Äôm done with it, trade it in towards the next one (at GameStop of course).",2,0,1615256790,DJchalupaBatman
