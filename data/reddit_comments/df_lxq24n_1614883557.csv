5,gpolwvt,"Not at all.  Not even a little bit.  I think the interest rate concern is not an issue for two main reasons:

1. People are not going to stop buying houses just because rates are 3%, or 3.5% even.  Look historically at the link I provided.... people were buying homes when rates were in the 15%+!  My first house was 5.25% and that was considered ""the lowest you'll ever see"" by my agent.
2. As rates go up the profit margin remains the same.  I don't know the exact margin on every loan but let's say it's 10 basis points, or 0.1%.... that margin exists on a 2.4% loan or a 3.5% loan.  The margin stays the same, the amount of interest overtime that the buyer pays is all that changes.",8,0,1614883791,MadeToOrderName

26,gponsxa,"Yeah, they have been saying that they're going to be using those funds in their digital platform, which is miles above everyone else's already. 

Regarding appraisals, it's a 10-day guarantee or client reimbursement. Unless that property is out in nowherevilltownland, it seems like it's happening as they say right now. 

Mat is as legitimate a Mortgage CEO as they come. I'm not often impressed by people, but that guy knows his game. Also, his facility is HUGE and is already ready for more growth. They do training there for new processors and loan officers as well, which is half decent. UWM is something to keep an eye on now that they're public. If they can stay competitive rate-wise, they're going to win big. It's just a lot easier to close loans with them over almost anyone else (admittedly, Rocket is a close second in that regard).

Yes they make money on every transaction but as mortgage rates change the number of transactions change, because it changes how many people can afford houses and how many people refinance or take out second mortgages.

But yeah I'm bullish on this one; they just make too much money not to be.  I honestly don't understand the bear case here.

EDIT:  For you theta-gang types, the $9 and $10 puts have pretty high premium as volatility is still high.  Personally I'm short the March $9 puts.

March $10 puts are $2 right now.  If it closes below $10 on March 19 you are in for $8 (which is a price I like) and if not you are up 25% in 2 weeks (which is a return I like)",3,0,1614890514,Keith_13
