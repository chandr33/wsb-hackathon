92,gqh2pvy,"For those asking what SSR is:

The Short Selling Restriction (SSR) restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10% or more from the previous day‚Äôs close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. if you want to short the stock you could only short it when it‚Äôs going up. Once the circuit breaker is tripped, short-sale orders can only be executed at a price higher than the current best bid. You can‚Äôt ‚Äòhit the bid‚Äô on a short-sale order with a stock under SSR. Which means you have to wait for the price to go up to your ask price for the order to execute. 

So, this has the effect of making it very difficult to short a stock. This rule that came out in 2010 was designed to prevent downward really volatility. It was designed to prevent flash crashes and big drops in the market. 

**Example**: if a hypothetical stock drops all the way to 85 cents a share from the previous day‚Äôs close at $1.00, under the short-sale rule, if the best bid is 85 cents you can‚Äôt short at 85 cents. You have to put in your short-sale order at a price higher than the bid. A bid for your (higher) ask price has to come through for the order to get executed.
