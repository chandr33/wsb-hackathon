33,gqedfrm,"My thought is I am bearish on anyone who is comfortable with their mediocre lifestyle and bullish on anyone who wants more for themselves. $GME is the 20th century american dream being made right now. And if our idiot friends with deep pockets want to help us get there lets let them on board. We cannot become elitist pricks because we were early to the ride. We must be inclusive and inviting. Also yes you are right. 16 year old kids should not be trading PLTR using daddies account. And those who chose the corperate ladder in some fud ass job like facebook should stay in their lane and let the retards who were willing to take a gamble win. I do not want to see the REDDIT ROCKET or the GME ROCKET turn into the GME BANDWAGON so some guy who bought in at $275 tomorrow morning can sell when the stock dips to $274.55 because he is a paper handed bitch just so he can tweet a picture and say GUYS IM HERE WITH YOU.
