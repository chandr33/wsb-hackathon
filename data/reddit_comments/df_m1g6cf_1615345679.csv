44,gqen9hj,"I actually thought it was a pretty good deal at $40 and strongly considered buying back in.  I wanted it at $30 (which is more than double my original cost basis from fall 2020) but it didnt get down there.  Not upset about that, it happens. 

It can keep going up but this company has no fundamental basis for staying here.  And frankly there's no short squeeze happening.  That already happened.  This is just a good old fashioned supply and demand imbalance, where more people want to buy every single day than those who are willing to sell.

You guys deserve credit for that.  What you did worked.  But nothing that is happening has anything to do with GameStop as a business.  Honestly I don't even know the point of pretending that it does.",1,0,1615345739,OlyBomaye
