6,gqiy5j0,"The reason people buy stocks from short sellers is because in a marketplace people can disagree.

Mister Short Seller thinks the $10 stock is worth $2.50, so he borrows it and sells the stock. Joe buys the stock from him because he believes Mr. Short Seller to be wrong and that the will be worth $20 one day.

Then over time, someone is right and makes money, someone else is wrong and loses money.",5,0,1615431370,CaptK4

10,gqiyfwy,"Yup, here is GME's.

http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0

It shows 52% short volume, whereas I believe the height was around 140+ ?

And according to this site, that means 20% of the 70 million available shares are shorted.

12,gqiyyet,"From my understanding Joe is just buying a stock, doesn't necessarily know its coming from a HedgeFund so he think the stocks a good buy and makes a market purchase... 

The lender is happy because they just loaned a bunch of stocks which get sold... and the HedgeFunds have to pay interest on the shorted stocks if they go up in value...

Also the lender knows eventually the HedgeFunds do have to buy the stocks back at market value... so at some point in the future more of their stocks will be purchased in order to give them back...

This is basically a risk bet for both the lender and the HedgeFunds, but the lender has the advantage of collecting interest on the difference between purchase or ""loaned"" price and the value of the stock at the end of the period of time... I'm not sure if that's daily or a month average or just at a certain date each month to be honest I just know they have to pay interest. As well the lender has the added advantage of having the HedgeFunds sell and buy stocks which increase the daily volume which increases stock value...",4,0,1615431803,BisexualFag69
13,gqiz4eb,"What I don’t understand is, the broker lent out the stock and collected a premium, whoever borrowed it then sells maybe millions of shares which technically causes a mass sell of the stock and allows them to buy at a way lower price. They then buy back the stock and return to the broker. However the Owner of the actual stock, is losing money because it was lent out and caused a drop. How does this sound right ? Isn’t that market manipulation?",4,0,1615431894,2ner1337
14,gqize68,"Joe is just buying a stock at market value.... joe is only screwed if he sells for a loss... if joe waits long enough there's a chance the company could bounce back and he can sell for profit...  


At some point all of us who have bought AMC or Gamestop have probably been Joe at some point without realizing it...",6,0,1615432045,BisexualFag69
15,gqizj1e,Often big hedges who are bullish long term do this.  It works two fold for them.  They want to build a large position  and with out raising the price through the roof they can’t do that.  So they lend out their shares (make money off interest on lending them) and get to buy more shares at a lower cost building their position.,2,0,1615432121,eyedealy11

17,gqj057y,"Shortselling is the #1 method of profit for hedge funds.

The SEC does not require disclosure of short positions, and the US has very few laws regulating shortselling because shorting is a vital source of income.

Eventhough shortselling is not an essential mechanic for an efficient stockmarket, it makes too much money to eliminate.",3,0,1615432468,ilikeyouforyou
