After that they‚Äôll either mail a card or direct deposit it into your bank account",10,0,1615411002,kerrowack

If they don't, you can sign up at the IRS website to get a paper one. I think you'll eventually get it either way.",4,0,1615411060,Snail_jousting

6,gqhvkes,"As long as your parents did not claim you as dependant you should be eligible. As far as timing, media reports Prezzie will sign it Friday, and then it's up to the IRS.  Things that may speed you along:

1. Did you file? (yes)
2. Did you use electronic bank info for owing/refund? (yes)

I figure within 2-4 weeks of Friday many people will have received them.

10,gqi1bu7,Which is silly considering they can take your money instantly but can‚Äôt provide money the proper way. I didn‚Äôt get stimulated and it‚Äôs probably because they sent it to an address I haven‚Äôt lived at in years. Says they used 2019 tax return to find your account but I haven‚Äôt gotten SHIT in my direct deposit. Our government is sad.,5,0,1615414452,CsDirtyTea

12,gqigph9,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt even want to think about how many folks threw out their cards because they were expecting direct deposit. 2/10 system. That super sucks your stimmy hasn‚Äôt hit yet, hopefully it‚Äôs coming through soon!",1,0,1615422179,kerrowack
