Hello,

I am a Finance PhD student, and I found a very interesting trading system that can correctly predict stock movement around earnings announcements. I backtested the idea and it works very well. The system picks stocks with about 80% winrate.

I will be publishing my picks in this subreddit and hopefully, I can get some feedback.

For this week my system predicts that Oracle and Campbell's are going to go up. My system says that it is better to buy the stock today right before close and keep them until tomorrow before close. If the stocks go up they should be sold, but if they will not go up then it is better to keep them until the next day after the earnings announcement and sell them right before close.

I do not expect that you invest in this stock based on my first recommendation. Moreover, I do not recommend doing it. But I suggest adding my recommendation to your calendar and see what happens. Probably after about a month when I will have about 20-30 posts you can make your judgment about the correctness of my system",1,0,1615224604,Dna7272
