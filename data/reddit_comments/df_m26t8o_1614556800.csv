21,gqhiw6n,"This is how it works now you learned this is how paper hands fold

I learned this during the very first circuit breaker you can’t cancel the sell order once it’s in or the stop losses",20,0,1615406435,Gbear831

30,gqhjqmv,"Im no genius but if you still like the stock then buy it again. If you buy it cheaper then you sold then it was a happy mistake.  If not it doesn't matter, don't think about the previous trade. 

Do you still believe in the stock? Has anything changed from when you were holding before?

You've lost nothing. You can just buy it again. Don't waste your time submitting a complaint, just buy it back if thats what you want

Easy fix.",7,0,1615406801,Cstooby

39,gqhm5pa,I doubt you can do anything about this. Your order cancel was queued in and auto fulfilled. You can probably call customer service but considering RH literally robbing us your chances seem really slim.,2,0,1615407849,Suckoutfrts
