1,gqhttgh,If it follows the same pattern as last time it’s going down but idk,-2,0,1615411129,Basil015
2,gqhttot,Can tank or moon. But I sold my shares cause it's not worth the stress. Rather bank gains than take 150% loss for maybe 50% gain.,-9,0,1615411132,ShitFeeder

4,gqhtz7w,Once it hits $350 again I'm 100% sure some other hedge fund is gonna sell and all the retail is gonna get caught cause it happens in 5 seconds with multiple halts.,-2,0,1615411201,ShitFeeder

7,gqhu555,I did the same I took profits today and bought puts for next week but I didn’t go heavy,-2,0,1615411272,Basil015
8,gqhu5ls,It really is 50% gain though. If this reaches $400 someone will sell. You guys are just tossing bags to each other.,-1,0,1615411278,ShitFeeder

11,gqhujlx,Yeah buying puts is the smart thing to do. Potential for more gains compared to risk. Like I see some of the gains on here and I'm thinking to myself dude you're up by an amount that can change your life why are you holding for a cherry on top.,-1,0,1615411447,ShitFeeder

13,gqhv85i,"$GME is a very unique stock and with all of my extensive research I can only see 3 plausible outcomes for tomorrow. First it could go up, second is it could go down and the third is it could stay flat.",3,0,1615411745,jh_watson
14,gqhvamu,It's not. Everyone holding has an incentive to push their narrative or downplay other peoples narratives. I honestly think that majority of people here are holders and you'll get the same feedback loop. If you're bloody holding gme shares at $300 you better cry foul when it tanks because the only people that are coming to save you is the short squeeze narrative and other people that believe in it. Also a lot of the ups and downs can be the traders I believe.,1,0,1615411774,ShitFeeder
15,gqi0oos,If enough peoole believe it. Enough oeople will buy in order to short out Melvin. We don't pump and dump. We fight the hedgies.,1,0,1615414152,Zauxst
