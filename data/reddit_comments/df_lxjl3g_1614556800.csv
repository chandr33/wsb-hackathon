9,gpnzob5,The company does cures for eye diseases. Macular degeneration and such. I got in way back in the half a buck days. Lots of potential but there's a vote coming to increase shares. Presumably to offset the cost of doing a business they aren't used to. Everything is going to be all about FDA approval and EUA. If the US buys into a vac from another country it might be really good. 81% efficacy from a trial that was a bit funky by our standards. And yeah the boomers new but the worst that can happen is I'll get bent over for not paraphrasing better. I don't speak ape.,6,0,1614874315,Logical_Painting2599

13,gpoddam,"I trade Ocugen about a month ago. Made some good money on it. My problem was that I didn't see the need for another vaccine company that isn't yet approved and at market. Why would someone choose this over currently available vaccines, especially when Biden says everyone who wants a vaccine can have one by end of May?

I don't think the vaccine pricing can really be that high anyway, it has to be capped or some shit by the government. Not positive on that, but pretty sure I've read it somewhere, sometime. Lol.",-1,0,1614880206,SuSpence11
14,gpoeuxu,Sadly I didnt have any faith in my bet and backed out literally the day before it blew.... and I know it was technically a penny stock then but wasnt GME at one point?,2,0,1614880832,_ThiccBiscuit
15,gpog75g,"I know nothing about nothing. But it's down based on who knows what beyond some med student died 22 days after inoculation in India. While India doesn't do postmortem exams and while the patient tested positive for Covid it's still a price killer. I believe it's a temporary prob. If this thing gets the go go from the FDA it will go bonkers. Stands to reason. If you go in after the ""possible dilution"" it could already be to happy. And won't come down much. Their last offering was for premium price at 7.65. I do believe. So the extra 95 mil might fetch a decent price if the big boys and girls believe in it. For every 10 good reasons to step into the abyss there's 9 more that suggests you'll never return. DD isn't worth spewing because it's all just ra ra in the end. Yes you can find lots of science and peek at what they do for the eyeballs but I'm no financial advisor and wouldn't want anyone to think so. My ""play"" is of no help to you. But timing is everything right now. At its current level and I was new to it... I would probably be playing with scared money. Unless I could afford the loss porn. If I was into the optional world it's definitely volital enough for some fun in the sun. Long time or short time. Just use your sunscreen. 2nd degree burns suck.",2,0,1614881402,Logical_Painting2599

19,gpozkf4,"Why would someone pick this over other vaccines? Many people are skeptical about the current mRNA vaccines, myself included. That‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm an antivaxxer or anything like that. I see great potential for mRNA vaccines in the future. However, not only are these types of vaccines ‚Äònew‚Äô technology, these are rushed ‚Äònew‚Äô technology. Does that necessarily mean people should not trust the mRNA vaccines? I don‚Äôt know, they‚Äôre probably fine, but that still remains to be seen long term. Supposedly there a chance these are ‚Äúturning off‚Äù cancer fighting genes. If that is definitively true remains to be seen. That may be enough for some people to choose a more traditional vaccine like covaxin vs the others. Plus, it‚Äôs looking like this one may be safe for children as well. Obviously more data is needed, we‚Äôll just have to wait for full phase three results to be released to know more (yesterday was just interim results) 

As much as I think mRNA vaccines could hold great potential in the future, given the choice between the two I would pick the traditional vaccine for now.",3,0,1614889464,redgunner39
