0,gpfkhjb,Yes Barry we’re all thinking the same thing. You have a brand new account and your trying to push some random stock on wsb. Which firm do you work for Barry? We don’t like wallstreet coming in here and trying to influence us on some random stock you offer no research for. If you want us to take you seriously Barry you have to bring us proof financial report spread sheet all that fun stuff.,1,0,1614704154,usernamewamp
