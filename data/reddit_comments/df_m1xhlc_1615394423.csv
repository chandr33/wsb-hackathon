61,gqgnwyz,"There are options that expire Friday that will need to be covered, because they will finish in the money.

Some people will only write call options if they own the 100 shares to cover. But MMs will write them partially covered, or sometimes fully naked, meaning they don't own the shares because they don't expect the option to actually finish in the money.

But MMs are not stupid. They don't just sit on their hands waiting until 4 pm Friday to see if they need to buy the shares or not. There's a formula, based on how far from the strike price we are, and how much time to expiry. As those converge, they buy more shares to cover. As we approach expiry, not after.

The huge increases we see in price like this, are usually do to MMs buying shares to cover the next batch of call options that are likely to expire ITM. They need to hedge. This run up in price is called a gamma squeeze.",1,0,1615394430,-king-mojo-
