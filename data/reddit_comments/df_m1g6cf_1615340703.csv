29,gqee1qx,"Covered calls.

Basically it's like what MMs do. You sell a call that you own 100 shares of, collect the premium, at no risk.

The downside of doing this would be that if GME is over 800, your position would stop growing in value. Because somebody else owns the 800C on your shares.

The high IV on GME right now makes it lucrative to sell calls - and if GME somehow hits 800, then you can roll the call by selling a longer dated 1200C or something to close your 800C position.",3,0,1615340740,commentingrobot

61,gqee4g1,"# GME Rhapsody

Is this the real life, or is it just fantasy.

I'm in a spaceship, escaping the galaxy

Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because it's GME, up it goes, GME, from down low

Any way AMC goes, doesn't really matter to me, G M E

&amp;#x200B;

Melvin,

He killed our friends

Shorted them to hell, hoping they would fail

Melvin,

You had thought you won

But now you've gone and thrown it all away

Melvin, ooohhhhhh

You can't make us sell

You had better prepare for us tomorrow

We carry on, carry on. As if losses really matter

&amp;#x200B;

Too late, your time has come

It sends shivers down my spine, boners all the time

Goodbye, Melvin Capital, you've got to go

Gotta leave your shorts behind and face the truth

Melvin, oooohhhhhhh

You're about to cry

And you'll be wishing you weren't born at all

&amp;#x200B;

I see a little, sad excuse of a man

He's douche, he's a douche, he will go to jail

GME up-trending very, very frightening

Vlad and Plotkin,

Vlad and Plotkin,

Vald and Plotkin down they go

&amp;#x200B;

Down they go, oh, oh, oh

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a poor ape nobody loves me

We are just autists from a poor family

Spare us this life, we are financially

Unstable, we're unstable, We're unstable

Let us grow

Let us grow, grow grow grow our

portfolio

Oh mama Cathie, Papa Elon, Daddy Gill, help us grow

&amp;#x200B;

Sleepy Joe has a stimmy put aside for me, for me, for meeeeeeeeeeee

&amp;#x200B;

So you think you can stop us and spit in our eyes

So you think you can short them and let them bleed dry

Oh, baby, can't do this to us baby.

You're going down, you're going down, bankruptcy

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing really matters, anyone can see

Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters, to reeeeeeeees

&amp;#x200B;
