16,gqg6wkb,"Hello my dudes. Here is  todays data from my Ortex account in case any of you find it  interesting. One thing to note: The estimated short interest by Ortex is  surprisingly good and quite well correlated with real short interest.  You can see this from looking at past data on GME and other stocks, just  in case you were wondering.

Colour Codes:

Blue Line: Exchange Reported SI from Finra

Yellow: Estimated SI % of FF

Purple: Cost to Borrow
