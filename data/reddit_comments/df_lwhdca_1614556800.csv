I'll probably get skewered here but my advice is this, how much you feel comfortable investing is different for everyone. Likewise the profit you want to make when you finally decide to sell... Also specific to you.",2,0,1614733561,yupyupfosho

I traded it cause I like the squeeze that happened. From a fundamnetal investment perspective, I like the stock enough to buy it at $20-40.
