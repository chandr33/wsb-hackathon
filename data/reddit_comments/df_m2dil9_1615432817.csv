14,gqj10so,"Hi gang. I‚Äôm an editor with a media outlet, so I wanted to weigh in on this. I should also mention my positions: GME 2@$190 and AMC 16@$8.20. Don‚Äôt laugh, media workers are broke as hell. Our industry is fucked. But I‚Äôm along for the ride.

I absolutely believe that HFs are pulling every dirty trick they can think of, but this post is predicated on a misunderstanding of the mechanics of how media report news.

Almost every news story you read has been updated and edited since it was published. This means it may include information that wasn‚Äôt available at the time of publication because that information was subsequently added.

So, as someone who works in media, here‚Äôs what I see:

1.	‚Å†An article about GME was posted 14 hours prior. No one knows what the content of that article was then, but it probably didn‚Äôt predict today‚Äôs market.

2.	‚Å†That article, at the same URL, was rewritten over the course of the day to reflect developments. So the article might have been released before the drop, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the part of it describing the drop was in it when it was published. That would have been edited in as it happened.

3.	‚Å†This is industry standard for any kind of breaking news. You publish a short story saying something happened, then add to it as you find more.

Imagine a hypothetical terrorist attack happens at ten AM. A report is published, saying little more than that it happened. As more information becomes available, the article is updated. You look at it at 3 PM and note that it includes the detail that a suspect was caught at 2 PM but the article was published at 10 AM. Do you assume the newspaper had advance knowledge of the arrest? Or do you assume the newspaper updated its story?

There‚Äôs lots of shady nonsense going on, but I‚Äôm afraid these details aren‚Äôt proof of anything.

I like the stonk. I understand the anger at shenanigans, I just wanted to set the record straight on this issue. May the tendyman come for you all.",10,0,1615432970,EthanCoxMTL
