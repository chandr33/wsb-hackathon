The stock market came into being when farmers wanted to ensure the price of their produce was consistent from year to year, to do so they need to transfer risk to others through hedging, the main point of the stock market is that others take the risk off your hands spreading losses and wins through random lotteries, over time most people in the market won't earn anything and because there is admin cost most people will on average lose money in the stock market. The stock market is supposed to be for those that can afford to lose money. If average citizens invest they lose their livelihood and their money in the long term. The market antifragile in the sense that the investors keep dying to ensure that the market keeps allocating resources to companies ensuring liquidity and depth. That's why the roaring 20s sucked so much as so many entered the market we had more and more people gambling away their savings and this causes a wealth divide. If we installed gambling dens in every corner of a town...that town won't work for very long. Therefore risk-taking must be at a certain level to allow hedging, and mostly for those that can lose their money and still be happy, otherwise, it degrades society as a whole.

As well as resorting to personal attacks, some (one in particular) are missing the entire point.  The game is rigged, and we thought it wasn't that badly, until the big players ordered the halt on GameStop/Robinhood to protect their asses.  It was clearly a play to save themselves, and hurt the retail investors.  If the market was indeed a free market, then exposing the short interest to the public (DFV at least) would not have occurred because, there are basic fundamental principals that would disallow a non nefarious hedgie from getting the stock shorted to 140% or whatever.  Perhaps it is inborn human moral principals, but I digress...  THey used the cover that they are armed with as giant funds to extend their short interest beyond any reasonable limit because they were so cocky and figured they could just crumble the company into the ground and bank themselves into a bigger yacht along the way without seeing the hole shot vulnerability and having Luke Skywalker at the helm firing into the death star as a probability.

Oh no no no, someone saw that there was a vulnerability along with a huge opportunity and used their game against them.  Same rule book, different antagonist.  What the hell is wrong with that?  Nothing... But then the hedgies or whatever ordered the stop, and their house of cards was totally exposed.  Now, they are having hearings about it because poor giant funds had rampant addicted gamblers shorting the hell out of GME while totally underestimating their exposure and got painted into a corner and couldn't get themselves out of the problem they themselves created and wondering why retail investors that are a bunch of apes could have pulled it off.  Now they are clawing for their lives to get out of this mess.
