3,gpopo4m,"Alrighty. My feeling on it (before doing a larger DD post) is that if it breaks above $12.50 on volume it will head much higher.  But it averages less than 50k shares a day and tends to be sold heavily above $12.  I just think there’s not enough people who believe in the company for it to go higher.  But obviously this community could change that.  They have shown that they can remain a sustainable business in the past 12 months by meeting all their targets and generating cash.  The real question is if their stock were trading a lot higher how would the management capitalize on that and grow the company? It seems they are happy with 20-30% growth on their core business and looking forward to the return of live events which they also make money off of.  So basically if you have an answer to that, we’re gold. If not this would essentially pump and dump.",0,0,1614885368,gonja619

9,gqe7o4v,Love it! Thanks for coming back to comment. I’ll probably sell some around $20 but $17.50 looks like a level with resistance. Gonna keep some for the home run if this thing decides to go back near it’s 2007 highs of around $30,1,0,1615337335,gonja619
