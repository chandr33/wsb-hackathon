31,gqivieq," Google shows the page was published 14 hours ago, as of about two hours ago. 

 Now others will try to say how they would have pre'created the page and then filled the article out.

 These are either interns, or idiots, take your pick. Do you make blank facebook posts, post them, and then update them the next day with what you want to write?

 No.  **news agencies  do not do this either,**  why?  Because Google rates news by its ""freshness""  having yesterdays time stamp would cause googles algorithm to rank your page lower then any current news that day, in the list of search results.

 You see, for someone like myself who has actually worked as search rater and ads quality rater, I understand how they actually rate news and articles in google search results.  

 **No news agency** would create news pages the day before, and then fill them out the next day as this would cut their SEO traffic in half, as google tries to give the most current ( present day ) results a higher ranking in your news feed and search results. 

 Anyone trying to claim "" they pre-made the page the day before ""  **is talking out there ass,**  and does not know a fucking thing about how SEO, and specifically how Google rates news and  how weighted page rankings work.",89,0,1615429959,MarketDisturbance
