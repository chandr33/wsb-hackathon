1,gpft5x9,"Prop 22 in effect since this year in California, I made close to 5 digi in this Jan alone; problem is they were not making money before pandemic, now with 120% minimum wages, they are deeper in the hole they dig. Iâ€™m sure Apoorva will push for IPO this year, so much for a dude has 20+ failed start-ups on his resume.",3,0,1614707934,d_HOME
2,gpft8dq,"GRUB, DASH, LYFT etc dont make any money either. Yet the IPO'd. Airbnb is just a fucking app with no assets. All these companies are pure speculative trash with no future or business model",7,0,1614707963,OrificeOfOmaha

4,gpftwja,"Maybe that's the next bubble....those people continue to lose their listings, the less viable the company is. I tried to use it recently and it was pretty gross, I mean I was looking in Sedona, but there were hardly any properties. I do know some people are doing their monthly room rentals through Airbnb, so maybe itll turn into a landlord co lol.",1,0,1614708256,vongolitsyn

7,gpfv14n,"A. 120% minimum wages guarantee, I basically make 20-25% more than before.

B. Healthcare subsidy, I got $1.2k just for Q1 alone, 3 more quarters to go.

Based on my Jan and Feb earnings. Iâ€™m projected $100k+ annually, thatâ€™s crazy! Thatâ€™s why so many people signup to be shoppers.",2,0,1614708750,d_HOME

15,gpg5xfy,"Have you ever heard of GoPuff?  It's a similar service, but one major difference is that they deliver from their own locations, and apparently they have over 500 of them.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPuff)

I didn't even know they existed until last week, but I came across one of their job postings on LinkedIn and decided to research the company.  They don't have a public offering as of yet, but I suspect they will have an IPO at some point, maybe by the end of the year based on the DD I did.    


Either way, I think building a turnkey delivery service with a flat rate that doesn't rely on third party delivery drivers or retail stores is a smart strategy.  Going after Amazon is pretty bold.

I haven't tried them out yet, but I plan to, but the downside is they don't have produce/deli.  


I'll be keeping track of this company to see if they offer an IPO.",1,0,1614713396,C4-Explosives
16,gpgaf90,"I'm not sure I'd lump AirBnB in the same cohort.  They were EBIDTA positive in 2018 and cashflow positive in 2017-2019.  TL;DR: They were hit hard by pandemic, but they can be operationally solvent as we return to normalcy.  If you're going to kvetch about AirBnB, it would be a question of multiples -- but those are nutty market-wide.",1,0,1614715330,beambot
