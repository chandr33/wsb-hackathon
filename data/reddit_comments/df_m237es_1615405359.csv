30,gqhgdqo,"&gt; The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day.


In other words, we would need to end the day today below $222.21 to trigger it. So if it drops a bunch before close, might be someone trying to trigger this.",1,0,1615405369,cereal7802
