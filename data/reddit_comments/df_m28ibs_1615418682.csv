Bought GME just over a week ago .as my very first foray into the stock market. Bought in around 130. Have 5 shares. I think I have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening here - enough to hodl through today, chuckling all the while. Any suggestions for good resources which explain things in simple terms? 

&gt;They‚Äôre running out of short volume and they know it

This in particular is something I don't get. 

I think I understand what shorting is and how it's digging HF's a deeper hole. What do you mean though that they are 'running out of short volume'? Does this mean they can't use constant short attacks ad infinitum? If so, why?",2,0,1615419445,PatheticMr

Because of this, the apes who are borrowing can‚Äôt drive the price down by selling shorted bananas back and forth to their friends. 

A general rule of thumb is that if there are massive swings on share price, without much volume being traded, it‚Äôs artificial. Nobody is ACTUALLY selling, except hedges who are doing so to eachother. Back and forth at lower and lower prices.

I'm not sure...

The way I see it, those calls are ITM anywhere above $30 (3/19)...they don't get much if his money goes back in $100 lower...unless they accept that $170/share loss is acceptible...if they did, we'd see spikes above $800 ...they have too much out.    I'm not smart...feel free to show me DD that shows otherwise, but draining off $300 strikes for 170 strikes doesn't seem like it's going to hurt the long game.  Especially if you are trading less than 100 shares.

100 shares @ $300 becoming 150 shares @ $200 doesn't let them breath. 

I didn't do this, but I wish I had.   I bought more at $201 and 291 respectively as it fell.  My basis actually averaged up, but if I had sold down at 320 with a stop loss and a buy order down at $200...how does that allow G.Floyd to breath when he needs $30/share?   

I'm honestly asking...no paper here.  I understand we need to control the stock, but how does this play - and it must be a buy back in - how does this play not equal control of 50% more shares at the cost of the short-sellers buy-down ladder?",1,0,1615421445,555-Rally
