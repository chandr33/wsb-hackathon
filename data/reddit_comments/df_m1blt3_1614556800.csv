Once GME takes all their tendies, the fiat they get will be worthless soon after.

you think the bankers will let you laugh into the sunset with all those tendies?  They are going to shut off power to your microwave after.. then tendies will be stale and cold.",-8,0,1615312072,Narshlob88
7,gqcqe1b,"This is my impression too, as u/paqua17 suggested, they're using gamma ramps to draw retail in to then sell at a profit as everyone 'averages up', and once they think they've run out of fuel, no more gamma squeezes, no volume, and then retail panic profit-taking tanks it (with some hedge-funds maybe risking shorting it on the way down). I can't believe the institutions don't have a plan for how to profit off of this.",6,0,1615312254,Phynaes

14,gqctvfg,"Contrarian/ factual view: Hedge funds have covered a substantial portion of their short. The new short report is out and as of 2/28 the shares short was 14.2M down from 16.4M. Don‚Äôt downvote me please here it is https://imgur.com/gallery/noQP5QM
The whole ‚Äúhiding in ETF thing‚Äù is irrelevant. 

Waiting for them to ‚Äúhave to cover‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to work. HOWEVER honestly this could go higher. Maybe much higher. There are no real sellers. It‚Äôs retail and passive funds holding, then probably 5-10% of the float turns over a dozen times a day from options/ algos/ HFT. Obviously there are some huge whales out here that keep Buying calls and pushing the price higher. 

So unless new shorts come in aggressively there‚Äôs not enough real money on the offer to drive the price lower? Or the whales find another toy to play with and this deflates? But they are making a fortune so I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd stop. Honestly.. I don‚Äôt know.",5,0,1615313795,Verb0182
15,gqctxx0,"From the book, Margin of Safety:

*‚ÄúThere is an old story about the market craze in sardine trading when the sardines disappeared from their traditional waters in Monterey, California. The commodity traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good. The seller said, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt understand. These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.‚Äô‚Äù*

Get that money, apes, but don‚Äôt forget to taste the sardines.",10,0,1615313826,TheElgringo
16,gqcu3sq,"I wouldn't say ""they"" are deliberately trying to profit off retail but we inevitably hold the bags when the price crashes. I can see this climbing above $300 but the options pressure falls off and I would expect a pullback then. That said I have lost more money than I earned over the years so take that into consideration. I do hold 50 shares at just over $100 per.",1,0,1615313899,paqua17

24,gqdc4zl,"Honestly, if I were short and seeing these prices, I'd just hold my puts and roll them over. Realistically, GME should be trading at $60.

25,gqe24xs,"I don't think anyone actually has a proper idea of what's going on, instead I think it's just a complete mismatch of coincidental factors driving the price up.

The initial price hike two weeks ago was sudden and I don't think that was due to the tweet or the board reshuffle. Retail just can't get that sort of volume and institutions wouldn't be swayed by an ice cream cone. Instead I think that is an insider buying more shares, the two coincide way too much. Maybe RC? Not sure, but he is looking to be pinned as CEO, possibly sees the success the brand will have. The second tweet caused another massive spike in volume, at the same time, I can't see that being retail.

Then there are all the new puts and short positions thrown in. Most people, including me, never saw this happening again. Short interest was down, sentiment was gone, people were holding serious bags. In comes all the people shorting the stock when it reached 70, 80, 90, 100 and so on. Then it went to 180, people would have been eating at that price drop. But still, a lot of new short positions, many of which come from all sorts of investor at each new price hike. Heck you see them in the comments. Violent price hikes could easily squeeze these people out and force an increase in shares.

Then there is also the shenanigans. I don't believe the conspiracy, its just never a good idea to use an assumption like that as a means of investing. Albeit, this could be true considering they were so blatant with their market manipulation in January.

Big investors may also be putting up the price as the DD mentioned in the comments suggests. I'm not too sure how the legality of this checks out however, as someone buying serious volume to push up a stock and then cashing out seems a bit dubious to me. So whatever, I don't know much about the SEC and regulations. 

People are FOMOing the fuck in, people are averaging down and up. Calls are being exercised, shorts are being squeezed, big investors are pushing up the price. Price is just shooting up, it might actually squeeze the shorts out in a way they did not expect; true retardation.

Anyway. There are a few things people seriously need to think about. Call me boring, but fuck tons of money is on the line from people who are legit YOLOing all their money into this (which is potential $ROPE fuel). Don't down vote shit just because you don't like it, reality is reality and this happened last time, many people could have saved themselves there.

 Secondly, do not get emotionally attached. This is not good vs evil. Hedge funds are on both sides of this trade. For every greedy cunt shorting the stock, there is a greedy cunt riding that stock. If you're in, ride it up with them and make sure you don't get played. You may hold till 100k, but they will sweep that rug out of you and give you their bags at a moments notice.

Also, take profits once in a while.
