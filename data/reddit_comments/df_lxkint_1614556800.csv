8,gpnfcs1,"Like many of you, I could have sold when it was 420.69. Me and hordes of diamond hands held.

When it went to 39, we bought more.

We saw paper hands buy in at 170(when it came up from 39) and then wet that paper and take losses by selling at 140.

I could have at least evened out twice, now I’m at - 30/40%. I’ll hold.

All the diamond hands been jacking this off for a good month now. The funds that we set aside for this gamble were not life changing. If it is for you, get out now.

Us diamond hands will prevail.

Maybe not to the actual Mars or Moon, but a hefty profit for sure.

I’ll hold. Will you? 🌪⛄️",852,6,1614864650,Prestos_mostly
