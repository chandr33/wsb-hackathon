13,gqih31h,"There can‚Äôt be a coordinated exit strategy. That would be working together to manipulate a market. Honestly, sit down with your wife and discuss which scenarios would you be okay with.

Are you good with taking out your cash when it hits 2k, even though doing so means you could miss out on that 100k in the sky? Will you feel the same way if GME hits that mark? Will you feel the same of Armageddon comes and GME somehow drops back to dollars a share?

Only you can answer these questions. Either way, I hope you get what you‚Äôre looking for.",8,0,1615422379,RBradyFrost

It sucks drinking your morning coffee and losing a few hundred or couple thousand bucks but it's the name of the game. You can't be discouraged about it. Have some faith in your own judgement, you buy into things because you believe it'll be profitable. I never understood why someone would sell for a loss on something they believed in.

1. Bulls make money, bears make money &amp; pigs get slaughtered
2. Don't get emotional, the stock does not care about you
3. The first goal is to always protect the initial capital

You've already failed the second one I think. Stop reading WSB and realize that 100% or 200% gains are not normal and at some point this baby gonna come crashing down. Everybody is in it for themselves and realistically retail investors have a pretty insignificant piece of the pie.

34,gqii84z,Sell after you think it has peaked. So whether that ends up being 1K or 100K you should be able to sell at $800 or $80K. If you sell on the way up you would not know what the peak is but if you are willing to miss out on the peak you will be on the best most reasonable selling position.

You lose nothing until you click that sell button, so just look at it not like you're OUT any specific amount because you aren't, your liquidity is just tied up at the moment. That's all. You already got the second rule out of the way, just play with what you can afford to lose.
