64,gpfeebn,"Is anyone else pretty impressed that it's holding at these levels even though it's off the SSR today? 

According to [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), there was some big shorting going on this morning through Interactive Brokers. So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).

Still, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.

At the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.
