42,gqedlmp,"If a hedge fund is short on GME and it goes sky high, they'll have to sell off their other positions to cover their GME shorts. That'll cause other stocks they've invested in to get sold off at an increasingly steep discount. The hedge funds could also end up going bankrupt, which might cause people with retirement accounts to lose their savings, which could really suck for them. But, even though losses on shorts may be theoretically be infinite, the supply of money is not, so eventually hedge funds would have to collapse and go broke.  


Realistically, I don't think it'll get to that point. I'm guessing we'll probably see a peak of $500 at the most on 3/19 and then it'll drop, and the hedge funds will be bruised but still in business, and they'll just use the GME losses to offset their gains in other positions and use that to pay less in capital gains taxes.",1,0,1615340500,slayemin

93,gqelpr2,"Ah ok gotcha. 

Moving from one TFSA to another doesn‚Äôt change anything, provided the money moved directly from one account to the other.

So after you sell, you‚Äôd want to contact Questrade to have them TRANSFER the money from their TFSA to Tangerines. 

I‚Äôd you simply do a WITHDRAWAL request (even if you‚Äôre withdrawing directly into the Tangerine account) Questrade will record it as a withdrawal for the year. 

Now this (likely) isn‚Äôt an issue for you.   There‚Äôs no tax either way, the only thing that could be a problem is contribution room. 

Taking it out of Questrade by withdrawal and then depositing it into Tangerine will count against your contribution room for the year.  So if your TFSA is maxed you‚Äôre gonna get dinged (hard) for over contributing.   But if you have contributed less than $75,500 (say if that $4000 is all you have put in) then it‚Äôs easiest to just do a withdrawal to your tangerine chequing account and put it into your tangerine TFSA.

It will count against you twice this year ($4000 deposit initially and a $5700 deposit now) but keeps you WELL under the lifetime limit.  Also it will settle out properly January 1 2022. 

Now if GME goes to the moon and you‚Äôre moving $250,000 over, you‚Äôll want to be very careful that it‚Äôs a ‚Äútransfer in kind‚Äù (of cash) and not a withdrawal and re-contribution.
