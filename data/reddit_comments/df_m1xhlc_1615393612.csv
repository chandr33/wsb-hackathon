Because he started with his experiments in the backyard, Jack Parsons  
As a little boy he already went a bit too far  
But the trouble really started when he found another young arsonist  
Because together they were ready to reach the stars  
So the two began to play around with various explosives  
Jack has stolen from the local powder company  
The military gathering a bevy of young rocket scientists  
Thought the boys would do what no one else had achieved

How high  
Does your rocket fly?  
Better be careful boys  
You just might  
Set the world on fire  
You better be careful boys, you'll set the world on fire
