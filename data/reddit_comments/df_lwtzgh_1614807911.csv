That's also why at 41 years old I don't feel bad using the word retarded as both a self targeted term for my own stupidity, as well as an exclamation if something happens that's unexpectedly awesome.

10,gpl0yq2,"100% with you my man. I'm a newtard here. GME was my first investment. Today I sold my two remaining shares for $124. Overall, I got out with nothing but a measly profit, which I have no problem with, after holding the bag for a month. 

I do believe there's a chance a gamma squeeze could still happen. And I hope it does. If it surpasses $400 again, I will certainly feel some regret, but I'm okay with that. I'm tired of watching it all day. I've gotten excited about investing in general and moved my several hundred dollars elsewhere, mostly into penny stocks.  
Yesterday, I would have put all my money into scam stocks, had Fidelity not prevented me from doing so. Today I learned about the different types of OTC stocks, and I think I bought myself into some nice dips.

There's also a chance my IQ is less than half of what it was when I was 10 years old.

I'm getting excited about all this stuff. It's a lot of fun. I'm grateful for this GME craze. I think it got a lot of people turned onto investing, people like you and I who might not have otherwise become interested.

I do hope the rocket takes off for you, and while I will bemoan the gains I missed, I'm glad for the little I made. 

I didn't get into RKT, weedstocks, or any other memestocks after GME. I intend to avoid them from now on.
