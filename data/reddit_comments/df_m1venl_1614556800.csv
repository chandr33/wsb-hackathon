&amp;#x200B;

So in essence, what you three are saying is it's not so much as a GFV that I've been worried about (although that's definitely something to be mindful of), but a free ride.

&amp;#x200B;

So to avoid this in the future, would it make sense to:

&amp;#x200B;

buy stock ABC in the morning with settled cash

sell stock ABC in the afternoon, gain proceeds

wait 2 days until all cash is settled

and repeat but make sure to do no more than 3 round trips in a 5 day week?

29,gqfpj1c,As far as I know having a margin account simply allows you to trade on unsettled funds.

41,gqfqs36,"Purchasing ABC in the morning and selling ABC in the afternoon is a day trade. Here‚Äôs a scenario where a margin account helps:

You purchase $5000 ABC on Monday, $0 cash remaining. 
You sell it on Tuesday for $6500. Also on Tuesday you purchase $2500 of XYZ. 

The issue on a cash account is the proceeds from the sale (and the original purchase itself) would be unsettled. For stocks it takes T+2 (two days from the time of the trade) to settle a trade.

A margin account still has caveats. You can‚Äôt just wildly buy and sell stocks because your margin is limited (a mistake I see a lot of folks make once they reach the $25000 PDT limit is thinking they can buy and sell as much as they want ‚Äî you can still get caught in a situation where you‚Äôd have to hold overnight if your margin has run out; to be clear, you‚Äôre not actually borrowing in this scenario). 

You might check out investopedia for pattern day trading and cash accounts. Honestly, if you‚Äôre new to investing, I‚Äôd say stick with a cash account and don‚Äôt buy any stock you aren‚Äôt going to hold for at least a week.",1,0,1615377643,SportTheFoole

43,gqfr7f1,"Thank you for taking the time to help educate me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started with  $600, and I bought into a stock in the morning, and sold before close for profit. I then, the next day I believe, took the entire amount available (more buying power), and repeated the process, and sold for more gains. It was then I had the thought to figure out if what I'm doing is allowed or not, and then I was exposed to these violations and PDT rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

For now, most definitely it's strictly going to be continued use of the cash account. Ideally, once I get to $30k (so I have a bit of a financial pillow), I can try day trading, but even then I would stick to the cash account until I'm positive I know the ins and outs, the rules, and I'm confident enough to engage in investing at that financial level. Could be months or a year, but I'd rather take the time to do it right.
