6,gpmuggy,"I dont think it’s US hating bntx. It’s just the mkt. The main Bntx is traded in Germany. I don’t know how much of an impact of US bntx shares traded has an impact in Germany. Pfizer also has other drug revenues beyond the vaccine. For awhile they had a similar rhythm, but it’s been off the last month or so. 

As far as I’m aware, the vaccine revenue between pfe/bntx is 50/50 shared per original investment agreement from pfe. I don’t know how much that agreement has changed since based on mfg, rollout, logistics, etc. 

Also pfe is a dividend stock, which typically moves different than non-dividend stocks. This is a factor to consider. Also pfe has been a traded stock ticker for a very long time vs bntx. Pfe is most likely part of large etf and institutional funds vs bntx, which is a new ticker since oct of last yr

I own both since vaccine efficacy announcement in nov.",5,0,1614847383,Retard_2028
