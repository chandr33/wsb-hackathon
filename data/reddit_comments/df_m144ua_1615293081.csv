8,gqbjz1m,"Consider letting your investments settle once in a while. 

If you have FOMO and want to buy in more, consider reshuffling your current positions as to not add more money. 

Only invest what you can afford.

Have a plan to put in new money once a 
week, or once a month, etc. and stick to it.

Realize it‚Äôs okay to sit on the sidelines every once in a while.

Have a plan for each stock you pick before you buy.
