7,gqgf838,"Didnt GME crash all the way to like $40? Wtf are you on about. Buy AMC because it‚Äôs the movies. Going to the movies is a very American pastime. Sure, streaming is the best thing ever but... how many people you know have had a ‚Äúgoing to the movies‚Äù experience? As kids, adults, a parent taking your kid, date with your GF, and night out with your wife, Xmas day! One of the most American things is going to the movies. The streaming world was hurting it then the pandemic crushed it... but ask yourself... Do you see a world where people don‚Äôt have the experience of going to the movies???? I don‚Äôt see this as a reality. 

PLUS the big money movie studios have a vested interest in getting people back in theaters. And AMC is THE theater.",6,0,1615390997,iThinkBlue
8,gqghwwt,Hate to break it to you but the average joe's who aren't  buying into GME at a whopping \~$290 aren't going to be putting up numbers to pump AMC,3,0,1615392079,Pcooney13

12,gqgj5me,it wont go that high. we bought this one because they can bounce back and create a sustaining stock investment. I bought to never sell. Hopefully enough are like that.,2,0,1615392594,BettieNuggs
13,gqgjwho,I am in both pretty deep. Doing well right now on GME and AMC is coming around. WSB should support both parties. We are all in this together. It is not a right vs. wrong or good and bad. We are all fellow apes and we should just stay positive.,1,0,1615392864,jontriharder
