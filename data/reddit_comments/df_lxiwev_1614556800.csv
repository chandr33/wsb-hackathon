1,gpn80k5,"Fidelity is the way, but still slow. You won’t start with margin access and it takes months for action to request it or options. 

However, these guys STONK and don’t mess around. Did nothing to attack us with trade restrictions or other fuckery. Get the ACATS!",5,1,1614859831,Candarie

5,gpnj55s,"Not sure if it’s true or not as I can’t see the brokerage’s back end but the idea has merit; either sell a wildly OTM call on the shares or put a limit sell on it. Think TSLA @1000 for current prices. That way it restricts them being able to (what was that .50 word they used) loan out your shares. 

If someone finds out definitively this works let me know.",1,0,1614866677,tech405
6,gpnjuov,"Moved from RH to Fidelity 2 weeks ago, cuz FUCK RH. They approved options trading and margin in less than 2 days.

Edit: Should have prefaced this with YMMV. Apparently the speed at which you are approved for options &amp; margin with Fidelity isn't FCFS.",3,0,1614867058,flapjack29
7,gpnl8og,How tf did you get options so quickly with fidelity? They won't even let me in at LV2 and they're backlogged for weeks they told me.,2,0,1614867774,Xenrakii
8,gpnq3ah,Damn man I moved on the day RH fucked and I am still waiting over a month at step 1/3. I’ve submitted extra CSR tickets to no avail.,1,0,1614870089,Candarie
9,gpnqcqf,Same this is the story I am getting. We probably are worth  a lot less than this ape,2,0,1614870209,Candarie
