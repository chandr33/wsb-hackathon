And I really don’t think the Fed will do anything about it. To them, this fear of inflation is totally justifiable given the inherent growth stocks have seen since covid lows. 

Also most DDs on WSBs are not due diligence, because checking a company’s income statement is the last thing someone on WSB would actually do or wants to do for that fact.",1,0,1614796445,mr_anderson59
1,gpkdpsd,"To your point of Tech getting the shit beat out of it.  IE AMD.  The fundamentals are fantastic but there needs to be a period of pull back, and the acquisition of XYLX needs to go through for the stock to break out higher.  Call purchase volume needs to chill for the next leg up to happen.  I'm a retard and don't know if the crayons go up my nose or butt or are for something else.  So you shouldn't do what I do.  However AMD is a part of my savings plan so I buy some each month when it swings lower.  It could break down to the low 70s or 60s, and if it does, the future PE will be in the 30s - 20s so that seems like a good time to buy a chunk and be patient. GL.",1,0,1614798436,FearTheBaldness
2,gpkjv2o,"I agree in pullbacks but what about consolidation ? Especially where tech stocks were beaten up and doubted early stages too which was not too long ago... where a lot of other stocks that thrived off that still have recovered lesser rate, so doesn’t that balance things where the massive pull back hasn’t occurred just yet ? I think looking at indicators like the VXX the trend upward recently hasn’t proven strong enough to show these drops are the real correction, that’s why I still see a strong recovery when next stimmy comes and then after that we’ll see another painful drop to that 60-70 levels you were talking about.... but with that logic wouldn’t it make sense for one more explosion of stocks to new “Biden” highs where AMD could fall to a “crash like” 120 -&gt;&gt; 70-80 what you think ?",2,0,1614801078,kamikazejesus
