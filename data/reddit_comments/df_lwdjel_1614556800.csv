7,gpgtti0,"Btw, the reason it dropped like that is because I was watching the price of the contract live when it went from $10.35 per contract  to $0.21 per contract, got halted for 5 mins, shot up to 7.60ish, dropped to 0.21 again , halted and then it resumed normally. Now, a month ago I would have been fooled, but this time I don’t care because I took my profits. Now is the fun game retards like to play where I sit and watch the numbers go up and down as HF’s set their offices on fire and go bankruptcia",1,0,1614723737,Investorian
