24,gqhsnqz,"It's a limit, usually set by the individual in the form of a sell order, that if the price falls by or to a certain amount, it will sell your shares to ""stop"" the ""loss"". It's primarily used as a safety net, so you don't loose all your money if an investment goes sideways. I have heard that some brokers have automatic stop losses, not set by the individual investor, but I can't confirm that.

Example:
I buy 10 shares of $COCK for $100/share. I might place a sell order with my broker at $70/share, so that if I'm away and my $COCK starts getting really small, really fast, the broker will sell my $COCK, before it becomes microscopic.

I would have used GME for the example, but GME is no place for stop-losses.",9,0,1615410618,Trevonious

27,gqhsnv5,Guys. This is my first time being involved in something like this so please go easy on me. I was so excited this morning seeing things go up. My account was nearly 10k in the green. My wife actually said goodbye to me on her way out the door to her boyfriends house. Then things got dark. I had heard that the stock market would halt things if it got crazy but when it did I freaked out. I didn't know what to do I'm not trained for this. I didn't realize how hard it was going to be to watch it all disappear like that so fast. So I did the only thing I could do in the moment and I BOUGHT THE FUCKING DIP.
