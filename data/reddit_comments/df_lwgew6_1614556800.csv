72,gphkupx,"Okay, for simplicity let‚Äôs say the current price of AMC is $9.

I think it‚Äôs a relatively good stock but I also think there‚Äôs a dip coming.

So I sell a cash secured put for 3/12 at a $7 dollar strike, because that‚Äôs a good price and a reasonable dip with it‚Äôs beta, and receive a premium of $42. That‚Äôs still a pretty big swing though and it‚Äôs possible the dip might be a cliff so I also buy a $7 strike put using the $42 dollars I made in case it keeps falling.

Now the dip comes on 4/9 and I use $700 to buy the stock. Turns out my bet was right and AMC moons to $14. I just made $700 and I let the put I bought expire.

Now let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm wrong, and the price drops to $5 on 4/9. I still bought $700 worth of AMC but fortunately I can sell it at the same price because I bought a put at a strike of $7. So I sell the stock and I‚Äôm no worse off. 

Now I can buy the stock at $5 dollars instead of the $7 I had initially guessed and when AMC hits $14 I‚Äôve made $900.

Let‚Äôs say though there‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôm really wrong. Instead of a dip AMC is going to bottom out. If I implemented this strategy I would either have no position or I‚Äôd have bought AMC at $5. Neither are too attractive but having the price drop while owning the security is certainly less desirable.

So to keep that from happening instead of buying/selling a single set of $7 puts I do the same at $6,5,4,3,2,1.

Now on 4/9 the price dips to $3. The $7,6,5,4 all break even and I buy 100 shares for $300 dollars. Now when AMC hits $14 I‚Äôve made $1300. And even if it never recovers before expiration I can just sell at break even.

89,gpih00r,"Early exercises are very rare, with certain exceptions.  There's no reason to exercise an options contracts ahead of time when the time remaining is still worth money.  You may as well sell the contract instead for more than what you would get by exercising.  The exceptions are typically when inexperienced traders exercise through ignorance or when the option is so far ITM that time value no longer has value since it's expected to remain ITM until expiration, so the bid/ask spread isn't good enough to warrant selling the contract.

There's a lot more to it than this as well, but it's the gist of it.",1,0,1614757961,MrStealYoBeef
90,gpisjy5,"1. Price goes down, you get Put the shares and lets assume you can Put them in turn, you have lost the spread on the options.
2. Price goes up, you don't have the stock, so you lose the spread on the options.

Guaranteed loser strategy I think.",1,0,1614769061,aka0007
91,gpitd3i,"Yeah after learning a bit it seems like more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. I want to do it for the hell of it though. If it doesn‚Äôt get exercised there‚Äôs no loss except the few cents for the trade so I can try it til it works.

Much less efficient than just buying calls though.",1,0,1614769806,NinjaPirateKing
92,gpitfcm,"Yeah it‚Äôs retarded.

Is it bad I still want to do it?",1,0,1614769862,NinjaPirateKing
93,gpj55sj,"You need to think through this math a bit harder

you are long the stock at 50
you sell a 50 put for $5 and buy one for $5
stock goes to $25 and you are exercised


You pay $50 to buy the stock in a market that is 25 - $25 loss but keep $5 premium
The stock you own is worth $25 - $25 loss
You are long a put that is worth $25, $20 gain

$45 in losses and $20 in gain, you lost $25 and own two shares and a put that is in the money.",1,0,1614778372,mikeyj198
94,gpkrv4r,"Look up cash secured put on investopedia.

Your math is gibberish and you completely misunderstood the premise.",1,0,1614804556,NinjaPirateKing
95,gpl392n,"You have completely misexplained the premise then, my math was basis your explanation.


Cash secured put is just a short put and cash in your account, what you are explaining is a convoluted mess, but still stick by my previous comments, trade and post your results.  This is not an overly risky trade, just unnecessary.",1,0,1614809533,mikeyj198
96,gpl3sct,Now look up a married put. And see if you can contemplate what opening both positions simultaneously would result in.,1,0,1614809779,NinjaPirateKing
97,gpodyjw,"ok, so you did do a good job explaining, you just really need to think about your strikes and how the options will price.  

if you‚Äôre buying/selling the same strike you either use a strike near the money to protect your long stock, but expose yourself to buying more shares well above the market.  

If you buy/sell below the market you get a better entry on your next purchase, but don‚Äôt protect the stock you own very well.

Again, good luck, post results.",1,0,1614880457,mikeyj198
