4,gqbqy8x,"Hey man I feel you I don‚Äôt have the capital to really make big stacks off of this, but I‚Äôm working part time in an economically depressed area to try and get enough experience for a better job in the cities, and even making a few grand off my couple of shares would do wonders. 

We‚Äôll be able to play with the big boys someday. For now clutch that banana",1,0,1615297362,DisgruntledTexansFan
5,gqbremd,"I followed this sub for a long time because it was hysterical to see how retarded traders are. Knowing nothing about finance or stocks, I decided it was a great time to start an account and throw money at shit and see what sticks. 

First couple of weeks I bought high and sold low because I was trying to learn ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù but now I see all of that is just bullshit. A lot of it is just about fucking the other guy and the gains will happen naturally. 

GME has been a great learning experience.",1,0,1615297613,ghostx78x
6,gqbt77x,"You guys are playing with the big boys. You just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

Making money in this game is a statistical anomaly. Clutch those bananas hard. 

Whatever you want to call it...conviction, perseverance, strength in the face of adversity, or pure autism...

You guys have it.",1,0,1615298555,cmmckechnie

12,gqc01tu,"First share at $272 to be part of the movement....then bought 8 more to get my average down to $140. At $40 I really wanted to buy....but my balls hadn't dropped, at about $48 my balls dropped and I bought 42 shares to have 50 at $62 per. Then bought last share at $151. So I have 51 shares an an average of $64. 

Really hoping to see this thing BLOW UP to $1000.....more than that?? I dont know but it's been a fun ride and profitable....eventually",1,0,1615301813,tim24601

14,gqc1iyp,You could have easily missed the train if you didn't buy in at 207 if you think of it that way. If trading wasn't haulted I think we would have seen 1k on first run and I don't think this second one would be happening.,1,0,1615302421,eblackham

25,gqcplyi,"Overall I‚Äôm down $3000 right now after starting with $16000. After taking the (unrealized, I know ) hit by not executing my plan of taking small gains on items at ATH, by holding to see if it goes up further, I lost the courage to buy when poeple were doubling down and buying at $40.
 Bought another at $242.",1,0,1615311913,vbfx
