0,gqgb7gr,I couldn't afford to pay my electric bill this month so I put all the cash I did have into GME when it was around $120. Looks like I'll be able to pay the electric bill now and have some cash leftover too 😁,17,0,1615389247,mcac

67,gqgb8na,"Silent ape here. Really just here to vent and join my fellow apes. 

FOMO’d in at $309. Held the whole way down and did the only thing I could think of and cost averaged down to @172 (should have bought more but got skerred)

Someone yesterday said “Diamond hands are easy on the way down, the true test is on the way up”. I think about that a lot lately. 

I’m profitable. And I so badly want to hedge myself and sell off shares. I keep setting targets and then waking up to see it opens - and stays - above my target. Renewing my faith. 

I’m here to encourage my other silent friends who may be in the same boat as me and want to peel off. DONT. I’ve read all of the DD. I know it’s good. Conquer your fears. 

Also - do not forget about the taxes on capital gains. Ole Uncle Sam is gonna come peel your panties off if you sell for small profits. 


Just want to thank you all here for the confirmation bias and bringing me along for the ride. I’m not here to say I’m going to do some whacky stunt or eat a horse penis. It’s a crazy and stressful and whacky ride. My wife is tired of hearing me talk about it. 

But truly. Thank you. From a silent ape. Thank you. I won’t bore you all any more. Just know that the group together is strong and even though guys like me don’t post all the time. We’re here.",32,0,1615389262,junksilverdude
