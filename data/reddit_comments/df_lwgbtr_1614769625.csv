9,gpiux7u,"Be careful in here. There's a lot of confirmation bias on this sub-reddit. Some of these people have even tried to say that walking into a Gamestop and getting paid $5 for something you spent $60 on - when that meant something - was a good customer experience. Be about the money. Watch the money, trust nobody. I wasn't in the military but I am certain this is nothing like organized combat would be.

Some people in this subreddit made a ton of money doing things that would have lost them everything in a slightly weaker market. The whole thing can go tits up anytime.

I disagree with OP on the very possibility that GME would ever go above $2000'ish. It spiked hard once. Institutional investors weren't ready for it. This time, if anyone needs to spend so much the float will suddenly be large enough to accommodate the shorts. GME will not be allowed to threaten the integrity of the market.

In the long term, supposedly GME is trying to get into digital distribution behind Epic, Valve, Microsoft, Amazon, and every other digital retailer in the world. They don't seem have the infrastructure or personnel or experience with the technology to enter this space to me. And they're going to win? Maybe they're going to finagle a way to make professional gaming a moneymaker?

After Google - **fucking GOOGLE** \- spewed out a complete shit show technologically with Stadia?

$GME is about the short term money, if you want in. But be very careful. This play may be played out; the funds shorting may have covered their shorts and immediately sold calls assuming the price would go down. Sure, they lose money if the stock doesn't drop, but it doesn't trigger the granddaddy of all squeezes. They're covered. They make one or two calls this month, the furor dies down, they stay rich.

70,gpj550o,"Second comment in this post lol but gotta say this: I remember reading about M$ doing a sort of subscription/payment plan for the Xbox where you pay monthly as opposed to up front and I believe Gamestop being a partner in this could be HUGE. Apple did something similar to this with the iphone where you always get to upgrade to the newest version. I’d have to double check but I do believe their own payment plan service saves you over the longterm compared to what carriers already offer but it’s not that important.

Look at the nomenclature for the new Xbox consoles: SERIES X and SERIES S. It implies they will continually release upgraded consoles similar to Xbox One and Xbox One X, only on a larger scale. Imagine every 2 years and upgraded console releases with more horsepower ensuring it always keeps pace with the latest PC hardware. It would be difficult to entice gamers to dump $500 every other year on a new Xbox, but a payment plan that guarantees a jump to the latest and greatest would be very appealing. If live is $10, gamepass is $15 (and includes live, obviously), and a plan that includes the hardware and gamepass costs $25, you’re effectively only paying $10 a month for the hardware. That’s only $120/year, and $25/month is less than most people pay for a gym membership and likely less than they pay for their multitudes of streaming services. Even at a new console every 4 or 5 years, it would still be a pretty good value especially of subsequent consoles approach the $1k price-point.

If the only physical retailer offering this deal is Gamestop that could be monumental for them. Imagine being able to walk into Gamestop every time a new Xbox comes out, trade in your old one, then walk out with the latest and greatest all while paying a fixed $25/month. People are more than happy to do it with their phones every year, why not videogame consoles? Of course, it’s possible big retail chains like Wal-Mart could end up offering the same but for the time being Gamestop is the only company I’ve seen announce such a partnership.

82,gpj94la,"I guess I am a boomer—-I had to look up what FUD was!  As I’ve posted before in my “sketchy” post history, I just started investing last April—mostly on stuff that was hit hard by covid.  Opened up a little account for myself and for each of my two sons—-all with those type of stocks.  The original plan was to hope everything went back up and sell this year (LTCG) and then invest in something “safe” with whatever profits we made.

I broke my own rule a few times throughout the year because I did sell a few stocks (in my opinion they weren’t going anywhere) and bought ones that seemed to have better potential.  I left the kids’ accounts alone.

Then in January, all that changed with GME frenzy.  I’d never heard of you guys or even thought that Reddit could be a serious source for investment advice/info/strategy.  [Boomer alert] I had to create a new account because it’d been years since I last posted anything (I remember MCA had just died—-whenever that was) I could’ve just kept googling yall like I originally did (“WTH is wall street bets?” In best shaky boomer voice), but I liked what you guys are about and how enthusiastic y’all are about the stock and just overall, helpful, fun, etc.

HOWEVER, I just wanted to air out my little anxiety to at least make others who, like me, have never gotten into something like this, at least feel like they’re not alone.  I’m actually very glad you responded because, when I have time, I’ll also look at your posting history and see if you’re someone who’s been here for a while and therefore worthy of listening to you because [FUD alert]  I need a little reassurance that I’m doing the right thing waiting for $100k.

I’m not selling for at least a year (unless the squeeze happens sooner, of course).  I didn’t buy all shares at close to $300—my average is down to $118.1556 because I sold some more stocks to buy more GME.  I’ll probably also sell a couple of more breakeven losers and buy some more when/if it drops again.  Im not going to sell all the stocks and get a second mortgage on my house and put it all in GME, but when I say I’m in with my little 13 shares—-I’m in, brother.
