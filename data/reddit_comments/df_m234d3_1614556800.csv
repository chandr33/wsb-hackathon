12,gqgwmmj,"It's funny isn't it.

I was watching the price on Trading 212, the price froze at $308 after hitting $340.

Then 10 mins later (price still frozen) a notification from T212 comes through saying GME on a rally - up to $330.

The moment that notification came through BAM..... $260.

THIS IS HEDGEFUNDS AND BIG PLAYERS RIGGING THE MARKET AND PURE MANIPULATION.

HOLD EVERYONE.",1,0,1615397753,TimsKillerRabbit

The **circuit breakers** are calculated daily. **Trading** will **halt** for 15 minutes if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.""",1,0,1615397770,spudlogic
