[We are seeing a trend similar to last week with our mini-moon. it is also comparable to the week of 1/19, which was a short week.](https://i.imgur.com/cxHcexV.png) Keith Godfrey hypothesized that squeezes could be predicted by 15-minute intervals showing the coefficient of variation in the price of VW. I hypothesize that his thesis is recognizable in GME. 

The days preceding a squeeze had significantly larger levels of variation than the days before and the day after the squeeze. If the first hour today has variation in price ranging from a minimum of 2%, we will see massive price action tomorrow.",21,0,1614866766,Tucker-French

58,gpnjd1v,It's very hard to set exit targets in a squeeze. last time it was 500 premarket before even starting the short squeeze. How high could it get now?? very tough to tell. 1000? 11000? 1500? it's better to sell on the way down the day after the squeeze to get a better picture of how much you can get for your shares. Not easy to hold through it tho!,2,0,1614866794,DragonInPajama

edit: thanks for the awards guys, but seriously put the moneys towards getting yourself more GME so you too can retire early, just like my teacher. See you all in the retirement home, apes! 🚀
