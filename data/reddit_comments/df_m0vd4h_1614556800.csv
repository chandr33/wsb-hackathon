1,gqa2hnl,"in theory you should have more than enough time to sell when you think is appropriate. the big people behind this (DFV, Cohen, etc.) are in this for the long term. they're going to hold on to their shares for the 366 days so taxes will be cheaper and then just sell little bits at a time to not affect the market.

this has always been a long term play primarily. too much good stuff going for this company if it decides to take new directions in business. plus if you look at the history of gamestop stock it always shoots up during new releases of consoles, and while the new systems are out nobody has any to sell. so that boost hasn't even really happened yet.

i'm just a retarded ape but i see value at least through next summer. so everyone can chill out and just leave or join as they please.",14,0,1615253227,xXxCOVIDfan420xXx

5,gqa444g,"You mean cheaper taxes? Long term capital gains is 15% for $40,001-$441,450 annual income and 20% for anything above that. Only way they’re paying 0% is if they make $40,000 or less annually.",3,0,1615254118,McPenguinButtSalad
