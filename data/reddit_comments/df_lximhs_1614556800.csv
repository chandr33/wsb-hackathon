13,gpn6v8f,"In the very short term today? I think TSLA stabilizes if not increases a bit after JPOW talks. As for the rest of the year I wouldn't take any bet on how low it will drop. Many growth stocks are easily 5x any reasonable valuations and the fed can only hold rates down so much. No matter how you look at it, TESLA is going down from it's current price over the mid/long term and even if people stop panicking for a moment that fact is well known.",4,0,1614858960,MrBaloonHands228

22,gpn86jr,TSLA is still overvalued at $60/share but all the hype of the future prospects may at least warrant $60/share (EPS 100). TSLA still had over 90% downside at the current valuation.,6,0,1614859955,rozhasi

TM sold 9.6 million cars in 2020 and was profitable 

Tsla sold 499,500 lost 800 million (1.6 billion of sales were ev credits to other manufacturers who wanted to avoid penalties) so yes tsla lost over 75 cents a share on their record sales",8,0,1614862616,UltimateTraders
