8,gqgczwu,"They could cover, but I think the idea is that they shorted at such a low price that they would be bleeding out the ass to cover at this or higher.  Their hope is the price drops and people sell when scared so they don't lose as much.  It's a fight between the interest paid each day to keep borrowing the share and the loss they'd take by covering the short.  Also there were more shorts than stock available to buy as people borrowed shares to sell and then the people who bought that share also lent it out to sell so the one poor share is getting passed around and sold multiple times meaning there are more people 'owed' shares than there were shares to buy to give back.  

Or something like that, I don't know, I just hit buy.",1,0,1615390011,DMvsPC

17,gqgczzl,patience. when it keeps getting halted that makes the ride to the top that much harder. this gradual rise is far more sustainable for a higher eventual peak.,2,0,1615390012,Rand_alThor__
18,gqgd00v,I missed it when it hit $250 so when it hits $300 I'm selling one share to take in some profit. Might put a little in another stock just to keep a little on the side since they dipped. Still got almost my whole portfolio on GME tho. Hopefully it ends close to 350-400 eow,-28,0,1615390012,ZeroGravityRockstar
