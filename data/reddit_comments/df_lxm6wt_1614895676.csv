89,gppp2o6,"My perspective into commodities doesn‚Äôt come from a trading / investing lens, but rather a geopolitical one. Best summary of the world to come is given by Peter Zeihan. The current status quo of the world is dependent on free trade and the US dollar being the global reserve currency. If either of this changes, supply lines shatter almost immediately - not just for consumer goods, but for simple things like energy (NEA4 pipes in essentially all their energy from the Gulf) and the basic ingredients for chemical fertilizers. Shipping and trade costs dramatically increasing will destroy the global food supply chain as we know it.

Also,  climate change. I‚Äôm ex-Mil and have spent enough time around people who will find any way possible to rationalize their anti climate change views, but I‚Äôm simple. For me it‚Äôs not emotional, it‚Äôs an environmental (and I don‚Äôt mean the environment, but for our situation) change that the US government, DoD, and JTF-CS have all cited as a major threat to US national security. Big implication for farming - many parts of the world with the greatest food yields on their land will lose that, many more inhospitable parts will gain arable land. Arable land is not equally spread out throughout the globe. Coupled with the increase in problems surrounding all things water, global farming will be fucked (like the üåà üêª).

One good model to look at is the Netherlands. 6th largest food exporter in the world but only 13k sq mi, or slightly more than half the size of West Virginia. They‚Äôre agtech is pretty great, and companies like AppHarvest who capitalize early on using this same technology have an early mover advantage in acquiring the best land/location (possible to grow produce close to population centers?)
