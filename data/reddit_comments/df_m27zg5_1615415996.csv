38,gqi4ntq,"Yeah I’ll get downvoted for saying the truth ape don’t like to hear but they didn’t “cheat”, selling, including short selling, is not cheating. Whenever apes buy stinks, there’s a seller on the other side of that trade. If you are allowed to buy, others are allowed to sell and also to selling enough to push the price down. Another way of looking at it is that it wasn’t their selling that push the stock down, it was you not buying and gobbling up their shares. Fair statement. 

My only point is that this “cheating” talk is bad for the cause, and childish and eventually will push apes out of the markets because they feel like there are “cheats” which they don’t have.

Edit: tl;dr
The only way to keep a stock afloat under selling barrage, or to push it up even in normal times is to keep sending marketable buy orders (market orders or limit orders at or above current ask). Just holding does nothing, you may not sell but there are plenty who will, and always be.",5,0,1615416035,JRyefield
