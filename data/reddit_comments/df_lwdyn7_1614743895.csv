79,gpi0cta,""" In addition, Super League has received a Notice of Allowance from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its ‚Äòcamera character‚Äô technology that creates a spectator view during a multi-player game. Essentially, a virtual character is placed in a game with ‚Äòreal‚Äô players for the purposes of visualizing the action of the game from the perspective of the virtual player.¬†The character‚Äôs movements are triggered by a form of artificial intelligence designed to follow the most interesting and exciting action of each game. Since this technology‚Äôs development, this spectator view has been employed by Super League in the live broadcast and spectating of competitive gameplay across multiple video game titles, including League of Legends, PUBG Mobile, Clash Royale, CS:GO, Street Fighter V, Minecraft and more.
