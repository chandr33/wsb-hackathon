1,gqhclak,"This coordinated effort by the hedge funds and the media like CNBC and MarketWatch is such blatant manipulation.

There were literally just minutes between the drop and the articles being posted.

This is going to cost them everything. They are so desperate. They are rage quitting using the last dollars they have left. Every single move by them makes me more bullish. FUD doesn't work on me.",48,0,1615403777,MassiveCollision

9,gqhclgz,I don't understand anything but could that big drop in price have been a hedge fund taking on a massive short position? Logically with the price that high it could be seen as the right time to short? Are they cornering themselves into an out of control squeeze again?,15,0,1615403779,blinky2310
