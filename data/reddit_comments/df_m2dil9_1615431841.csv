All of these threads are just emotional investors thinking they have some inside tip and are making bank off of the ""dumb hedge funds"" without realizing that at some point they are going to lose everything if they keep going all-in every hand.

I can't imagine why so many people here can't just take the massive win they got, and move on. Playing until you go broke doesn't show anyone anything, it only makes you broke.
