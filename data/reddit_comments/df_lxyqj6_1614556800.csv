7,gppr7kc,"Are you fucking kidding me?  Have you even looked at the commodities markets?  Prices are way, way, way up.

Things like grain are going to have a short term impact, and things like steel and copper are going to push inflation much higher in the longer term.

Gold and silver are only down because bonds yields are up.

Bond yields are up because no one wants to be trapped in low yield when inflation really kicks in.

Keep your eye on the PPI, not the CPI.

The PPI is real.  The CPI is bogus.",19,1,1614902060,ahminus

17,gppu5vg,"deflation in this case refers to the exit of borrowed money in the market, not inflation. He's obviously not explaining it well in his post, but you'd do well to read up on this in the next few days.",-1,0,1614903569,stonk_multiplyer
18,gppuv6t,"As I said, PMs are only down because yields are up.  Literally all other commodities have rocketed much, much, higher.  Inflation is already here.

""Energy commodities?""  Copper is way higher, lumber is way higher, steel is way higher, wheat, corn, soybeans, tea, coconut oil, palm oil, sugar, rice, citrus, rubber... in fact, *non energy* commodities have increased since the start of the year at the fastest rate since 2011.

Now throw crude in there, and you think we're about to have deflation?  That's total nutso, dude.

PMs aren't great inflation hedges, either.",6,0,1614903920,ahminus

As someone that worked and lived in Japan from 2010-2018, the amount of times I heard of deflation fears is countless.
