Uptown stonk
She's been climbing in her gamestop world
I bet she’ll never have a wallstreet high
Until the hedgies are all forced to buy
🚀🚀🚀
I'm gonna hold me an uptown stonk
She's been shorted by a white-collar world
Because of retards with our diamond hands
She will be summoning the tendieman
🚀🚀🚀
Hey that’s our jam
🚀🚀🚀
And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she lifts off
And shoots through the sky
🚀🚀🚀
Hedgies are not so tough
Just because
We’re in love with an uptown stonk
You know I've seen her in her gamestonk world
She's getting tired of the shilly-bot noise
And all the shorting by those Melvin boys
🚀🚀🚀
We have no choice
🚀🚀🚀
HOLD HOOOLD HOLD HOOOLD HOLD HOOOLD 
🚀🚀🚀
Uptown stonk
She keeps on climbing in her gamestop world
All apes are making sure that some day soon
Our girl will rocket launch right to the moon
