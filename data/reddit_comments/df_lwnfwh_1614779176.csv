11,gpjstkp,"I love Costco. I buy pretty much everything from there for my home. I was looking at the price this week and was thinking the same thing you are. It‚Äôs definitely at a discount. 

 I read somewhere that membership renewal rate was like 91%, but I can‚Äôt remember my source on that. It‚Äôs definitely a solid play. 

I also loaded up on a $340 March 19 call. I wish I had more buying power to get more.",1,0,1614789492,acescore2
