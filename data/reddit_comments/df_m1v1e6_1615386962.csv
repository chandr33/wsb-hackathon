27,gqg6ai7,"Big money institutional investors are named as Authorized Participants  when a fund is created, and they have the authority to take a number of shares of a fund and exchange it for a number of each stock contained in the fund or vice versa.  They can convert ARKK to all the shares in ARKK or vice versa, and they do this in order to stabilize the price of the fund relative to the stocks in the fund - if ARKK is trading at a price higher than what it should, they'll buy all the shares, turn it into ARKK, then sell ARKK and walk away with a profit, and the share price will rise from the buying and ARKK will drop from the selling and it'll all even out.  They also ensure that there is sufficient supply of shares of an ETF as money flows into the fund.  Google 'Creation Unit Authorized Participant' to get a more in-depth and well-written explanation but this is basically the gist of it.",1,0,1615386986,Bcron
