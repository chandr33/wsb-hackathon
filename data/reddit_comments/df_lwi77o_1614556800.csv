Remember he’s said many times that his wealth is to get humanity to Mars and beyond so if a pop-culture at Tesla led to him being the richest man alive, then he will most likely double up and do it all again.",1,0,1614767375,itsMeeji
12,gpivjcc,"Can you please elaborate on the TCO of an EV versus an ICE vehicle.

Saying something is too expensive just sounds dumb.

Also, what will I do with all my GME (from last Jan! I am out), TLRY, and now RKT tendies if not buy every car Tesla makes?",0,0,1614771712,aka0007
13,gpj085s,"The question is when it pops? Burry hinted it will happen this year. But you can never time such a thing. Tesla's losing market share in EU, GM and Ford catching up, quality issues in China, Texas factory down. All looking pretty grim for Tesla's valuation",1,0,1614775272,Biggus_-Dickus
14,gpj78mt,"Total global car sales is around 80 million. I hope Tesla loses market share. They can't possibly produce all 80 million cars in 2030 :-p
Look at their year over year growth instead. Others are getting in the game and selling...some.

Cant afford a Tesla but I bet you got that sweet brand new GMC 2500....

Non of my houses in Philly are selling 30% over. Rent hasnt really gone up a lot either in the past 5 years. Maybe in the burbs where scared people ran to. Oh well.

Adding: If you ever watched any of those Rogan interviews, specifically the first one, he speaks of his mental condition. He isnt normal. He legit has issues. Fortunately his issues created a genius and one of the most important people the world has today. He cant sleep due to his brain going nonstop. Let the man do his thing. Look at the numbers. All the numbers.",1,0,1614779536,DragoBTC
