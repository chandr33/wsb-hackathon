1,gpg6k28,Always been curious how/why and to what degree stocks hold gains from pre+after hours when the volume is also low. Just the vwap for that countryâ€™s hours? Some of that price is held if the stock moves in the same direction during 9-5 and the vwap just moves up,2,0,1614713666,JinnPhD

3,gpg7a2d,"betting against the VWAP, from an institutional or retail standpoint, is a losing move. After-hours moves and pre-market moves are volatile because the volume is generally low unless hedge funds are trying to screw with each other. It's basically just speculation on movement through the day done by the big wigs.",1,0,1614713980,CAT6_

Check High and Low. If i am not mistaken, we have another Day of SSR. And if by Intent, what i am certain of, we just saw a Demonstration to the Entity that is trapped. Seems to me like a Middlefinger made out of Stock.",1,0,1614714245,ImaNerdsoami

12,gpgba03,"I'm not sure exactly how to use this in conjunction with my brokerage account. It's a measure I'd like to track but I have no idea how to implement it.

Can you make a step by step for complete morons like me please?",1,0,1614715699,Agotoguy
13,gpgby3o,"Thanks for the post OP. What sustains a price at a 'premium' compared to VWAP? Sorry if that's a stupid question but as an example, rkt right now is around +1.5 SD above vwap. Is there anyway for VWAP to converge on current price by trading sideways or is it always stock price correcting to return to the mean?",2,0,1614715989,deezilpowered
14,gpgcxgp,"The only thing that could sustain a new, higher price is the presence of sufficient buying volume. As of right now, RKT's weekly and monthly VWAP are moving in sync (converged) at $35.21 while the daily VWAP sits higher (but not by much) at 36.58. Trading sideways is another means for the VWAP to rise and sustain that movement, but it generally takes longer and results in the ""distribution triangles"". This doesn't mean that the VWAP won't fall however. A high volume whale can take profit and lower the VWAP.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, low volume price movements (typically shorts) will correct back to the VWAP at the very least and potentially overcorrect given enough hype which can lead to another VWAP increase.

&amp;#x200B;

The effect you are describing is more often observed in digital currencies upon a fair launch. It's way easier to not fall prey to high volume whales as you can literally watch the top coin holders for any changes in their wallet balances.",1,0,1614716415,CAT6_

17,gpgdzok,no shame in selling and repositioning yourself. I never buy the top of anything and only buy at a discount to manage my risk.,1,0,1614716866,CAT6_
18,gpgeyhz,"Something I'm going to look into depending how this halt goes. Definitely will use moving forward though for future ones! 

Any other indicators you find useful? I was using RSI and momentum but both seem somewhat pointless with VWAP now haha.",2,0,1614717273,deezilpowered
19,gpgg05d,VWAP shouldn't be the only thing you look at. Use your old strategy in conjunction with the new.,1,0,1614717719,CAT6_
