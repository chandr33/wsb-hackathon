42,gqf265w,The stock is already heavily speculated to go down so option prices are already high and adjusted according to what's most likely to happen you cant just simply buy da poots and have them print money if anything they'll just keep going down from here basically options make money from more unexpected movements in this case going down is expected and they have already been priced accordingly now if op would have posted this on Friday we would have made money,1,0,1615355325,chase-248-5

44,gqmogqu,"Erm... SG&amp;A has been higher than gross profit 3/4 previous quarters? Ultimately low margin company? CTRL + C, CTRL + P of GrubHub? If one assumes 20% NIM ultimately (Probably too high), to justify current valuation using an optimistic P/E ratio of 20 requires 4X sales, current \~ 11X sales (annualized last quarter), so unless they can grab a lot of market share from other competitors and have their margins quite high, and growth in home deliveries continues, valuation seems bloated to me. (Correct me where I'm wrong; I haven't looked closely into the company, I just was bored on Reddit a while ago and commented on this post)",1,0,1615504345,WeenieBrothIV
45,gqmustg,"True on low margins, but all the delivery companies are low margin (low enough where only 1 company has been earning real profit).

It comes down to this: Grubhub makes most of their money when restaurants do their own delivery (merchant run delivery). The problem is, you need supply to meet demand, which means adding any restaurant to the platform that you can. DoorDash and Uber figured out a neat little trick where you can ultimately put any restaurant on there that you want without permission, but you'll lose money doing it. This move made Grubhub had to do it to keep up with supply/demand, which now is why you see everyone pissed off at all those companies and then trying to get their restaurants removed. The real money is made on merchant run delivery and more and more cities are now implementing laws that make them have to remove their restaurant as a listing without permission. All of that is going to take time though.

Some other issues that are happening besides restaurants having to be delisted are driver rights and fee caps. Those issues will continue to pop up all over, causing more money that is going to be lost. The thing is, Grubhub makes their money off merchant run delivery, so they'd love to get rid of their fleet one day if gig workers have to be treated as employees. Commission caps are causing increased prices which means decreased orders for all companies since they pass those costs to the customers (Doordash/Uber more so than Grubhub). Anyway, I think Grubhub is right where they should be and Doordash and Uber should be lower. 

I do think you are right on the money with the marketing. That's the plan: https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/grubhubs-new-owner-offers-glimpse-potential-us-strategy",1,0,1615507638,rbarbour
