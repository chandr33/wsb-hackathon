16,gpkvnz9,"Oh man coming in here with facts. People are pissed. AMC was never a good play it was just a bunch of people who missed the GME train.   


Outside of both companies not doing great (bleeding money) over the last few years. GME has taken steps to reform their business model and make the structural changes needed to survive. AMC hasn't done shit. They have staved off bankruptcy for the next couple years by doing that debt conversion but ultimately are even more fucked with places like Disney releasing direct to home which lets them cut out the middle man.   


Then of course everything is a squeeze now. Except when it isn't AMC short interest was high but never enough that any real squeeze was in the works. I get the pain of missing out on GME but the reason GME is different was that they fucking over shorted the hell out of it synthetically. AMC short interest was in the low 40s at its peak.
