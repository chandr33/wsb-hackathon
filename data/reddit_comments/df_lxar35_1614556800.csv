4,gpm0311,"Good sound research. My best friend is an agent and she‚Äôs definitely pissed. Zillow has purchased the software they all use to book showing, as well as the listing software. Another agent in her brokerage was listing her own house, and Zillow called her saying she should get rid of her agent - both illegal, and idiotic since she was her own agent. 

Another agent in the office found out that Zillow contacted a client because they were able to pull an email address from some paperwork. 

Shady shady shit. Agents are PISSED.",13,0,1614826402,tech405

8,gpm0t5m,"Great analysis. The other piece you're missing is how competitive the online marketing space is for REAs - so their Premier Agent service is also going to see increased competition.

It will take a long time for them being licensed in all 50 States to see revenue as well - with hefty upfront costs. Agent acquisition isn't cheap or easy. So definitely short term bumps coming.",1,0,1614826777,michty6ty6

15,gpm2bs3,Zillow is doing for housing what Uber did for taxis . Their stock price is going up long term. It may be overvalued right now however. Why would people pay 6% fees to an agent when they can play less by buying/selling with Zillow?,5,0,1614827557,Turbulent-Wave2213

18,gpm2svw,"Zillow has recently swapped to an IDX based system to display their properties. What does this mean? It now utilizes the exact method of pulling data off MLS databases that any basic real estate website out there does. It literally has no advantage to presenting listings, this was always the biggest upside of Zillow.",1,0,1614827803,donotstealmycheese

21,gpm3iqv,"Dealing with agent on both sides with two different goals makes the process of home buying much more
Complicated than it should be. All we need is fair appraisal, someone to sell our house instantly (no waiting for a homebuyer). They can take their small fee if they make the process easy, fair and simple",2,0,1614828163,Turbulent-Wave2213

23,gpm60x3,What do you think about the moats Zillow has like brand recognition. It‚Äôs had competition like red fin and trulia but the average lay person like me thinks about Zillow first.,4,0,1614829486,musicantz
24,gpm6cv1,I thought the agent was your wifes's boyfriend's wife,1,0,1614829671,Col_forbin_
25,gpm6jda,"As a house flipper myself I fine most agents are useless and only there for 3% commission when I list myself. Most agents don't know jack shit and real people in the know are the Escrow agents.  If Zillow can effectively middleman the transaction and the mortgage loan into one single streamline process I see a huge upside. 

I had a realtor license at one point too.  When I go view a home I'm flippin I usually test the listing agent to see how competent they are and what the real sell price is. I think 6% is absurd rate to list on with an MLS Agent.",10,0,1614829774,AZWHEN
26,gpm845r,"True, except according to this dd, they‚Äôre main revenue source that doesn‚Äôt take a loss is from agents. So if agents are actively going to stop using zillow, then that would cause at least a short decrease in the price",2,0,1614830658,DLane69

28,gpm8bma,Yeah short term that could definitely happen. But long term I think Zillow and open door will win out in their model,1,0,1614830773,Turbulent-Wave2213

36,gpmg75l,"Actually I don't think their moat is very solid. Zillow has brand loyalty for Boomers and Gen X(this is me and I'm üåàüêª for Zillow). Home ownership rates for Millenials is like 47.9%, lowest of any generation by far 22% lower than Gen X. 

As the up and coming buyers Millenials are the target growth demographic and Zillow sites feel old and dated. I've used it many times the last 15 years and hasn't changed much. 

Redfin has a smooth app interface, already brokers in all 50 states and for a whopping 1% commission if you sell and buy through them. Incredibly attractive to budget conscious Millenials. Quick peak into the financials make me think are winning the war for the next generation of home owners and Zillow could take a massive shit as they try to play catch up.",3,0,1614835612,Rekeever
37,gpmjd3l,"Being a house flipper you probably have more knowledge then your typical consumer.

And it's not 6% to the agent. Its 3% to the buy side, 3% to the sell side, split 60 to the broker 40 to the agent minus advertising expenses.",1,0,1614837862,darksoulmakehappy
38,gpmjnvp,"Escrow/title agents run circles around your average RE agent in their knowledge of the business. However, I hope Zillow also does something about the extortionary tile insurance fees and disintermediates those as well!",1,0,1614838090,SeemoarAlpha
