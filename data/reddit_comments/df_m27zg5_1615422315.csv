2,gqigz6k,"Right when it crossed $350 a share there was a huge selloff, most likely shorts pushing the price down - the halt happens anytime any stock price moves more than 10% in a minute, the exchange (not the brokers) freeze the stock for five minutes.  It halted a bunch of times in a row, dropping 10% in between each time.  When the shorting/selling stopped the price regained half of what it lost pretty quickly.  

Really curious to see what happens if/when it crosses 350 again tomorrow.",2,0,1615422321,brcguy

14,gqih19e,"In short, let's say a stonk is trading at $250.  If I set up a trade to sell, but make it a stop limit trade I can name a price, say $200, and the sale will happen of the price drops to $200.  This is a ""stop loss"" that prevents me from losing all of my tendies.

But if I set up the sale with a trailing stop limit, instead of a stop limit, I can set a trail of $50.  Initially, the brokerage will sell my shares if the price drops to $200 ($50 below market).  But as the price of the stonk goes up, so does my stop loss, always staying $50 behind the high price of the day.  So if the price rises to $275 my stop limit is now $225.  If the price falls back to $250, my stop limit stays at $225.  If the price goes to $300, my stop limit rises with it, up to $250.

The second half of the plan is to do the reverse with a buy order, and to have that be a ""conditional"" order that only triggers if the first order (my stop loss sale) goes through.  I know that if the price is down $50 off the high, something crazy may be happening.  A trailing stop to buy with a $10 trail follows the share price down and only executes if the price rebounds and reaches a value $10 above the low for the day.

Maybe try a web search for examples of a trailing stop trade. That will probably give you a better idea of how it works than I did here.",6,0,1615422353,Cromulent_Tom

It looks like institutions may have bought north of 1 million shares today on the dip. This gives them some leverage. My guess is they will attempt a massive sell at some point to scare us into selling - could be at open tomorrow, could be after the next leap, who knows.
