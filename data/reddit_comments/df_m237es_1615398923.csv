22,gqh08rj,"I'm retarded so take everything I say as such.

The way I've seen this whole GME situation has been a means of showing the general public that the game is rigged against them, that the financial isntitutions don't exist to benefit the collective like we all were taught but instead are meant as a money printing method for certain 'In the know' types.

I read body language, as I had an extremely traumatic childhood, I have a natural knack for it, some of the interviews being given show a level of fear and worry that belies a much deeper beast than a few tendies.

I've also had nothing but free time for years to study things for myself and the world we live in is more like a House of Cards than most people would imagine, a number of things only exist on paper but we act like they're real entities all the same, it's quite fascinating. But you're seeing first hand what's been transpiring against us as a collective.
