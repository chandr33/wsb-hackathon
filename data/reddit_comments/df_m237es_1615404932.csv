28,gqhfdhs,"I think they might have had some shares stored away that they started grabbing when price was $40~ and they slowly bought and bought but didn't cover shorts because it would've cost too much even at $40. 

So in turn they had a cash that they could sell and it would help cut their losses and offset price. Based on where I saw the volume at $335 and then where it was at $184 it looked like close to 20 million shares got traded in that time. 

IF (VERY BIG IF) HF had bought the dip at ~$40 and sold at ~$340 then they make $300 a share, maybe just a million shares?.. That's still $300mm, a win for them as it stops price and they profit.",2,0,1615404942,Slickwillyswilly

85,gqhfeev,"That's the million dollar question right there. I can answer some of it, but the rest is really up to you. In terms of buying, if you want to buy it at $245, set that price as the limit. If it stays above that line, it will not be purchased. Once it crosses that line, it will be purchased. You can set a ""TIF"" (Time in Force) where if this limit is not executed in a certain amount of time, it will cancel itself. On the flip side, setting a limit to sell, means your stock won't sell until it hits a specified limit. As you just saw with GME, a ton of people had $300 sell limits and the price fell a bit once it hit that level due to the mass sell-off.",1,0,1615404953,DCBullets202
