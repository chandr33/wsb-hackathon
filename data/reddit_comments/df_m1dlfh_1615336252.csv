You have to lay out how the possibilities become more probable. And the higher gme climbs the less likely it is to hit new highs as 1. Longs cash out, and 2 shorts go hard as a mofo knowing very well that GME will not be at that price for a long time and all they have to do is wait it out.

The only way i see GME getting into the meme levels of price ranges is through a constant battle of shorts and longs slowly pushing gme higher each squeeze. But in terms of the current squeeze we have up coming this is most likely the only or 2nd to last chance( gme vote in june is highly likely) for people to make a killing.

GME will not cause a crash. If anything it will create a healthy correction with ample entry points for a ton of new retail cash as people seek to reinvest their gme gains",1,0,1615337243,Vi0lentByt3
