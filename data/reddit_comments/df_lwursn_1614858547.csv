7,gpo21z2,"I didn’t say a deep value now, until the boomer gen dies off there is still value in brick n mortar. Streaming services like hbo+, disney are playing current movies but all major blockbusters have been put on hold until the pandemic is technically over. The squeeze potential is most likely gone as you said with the dilution. I still see it rising above $8 with the buzz around amc as more theaters re open, If you feel its gonna go back then buy puts, theres always a play to be made.

This is not advice just me rambling",1,0,1614875345,gotword
