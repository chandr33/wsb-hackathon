21,gqbtesb,"I definitely think that they've tried some form of this technique, but aside from the last time when they stopped many from buying, I don't believe that they can be very successful this time. Not to mention that the availability of shares must be miniscule at this point, plus we are so much better equipped for any price changes that only the paperiest of paper hands will sell shares at this price. The higher it goes though, the harder it's going to be to sustain momentum, but man, this is such a fun ride!

22,gqbtfnr,"So, this is not financial advice, but what I've done is write up a little ladder in a spreadsheet with various price levels, along with my total position etc. Then I just fiddle with how much as a percentage I want to sell at what level until it gets to a point where I'm comfortable.

For me, I want to sell max 10% of my position to cover my cost basis, as early as possible so I can let the rest run with house money. That means my potential profit ceiling comes down a bunch, but Im more likely to realise more of it because I won't pussy out when I get scared later on.

Once your cost basis is covered, even if the rest ends up being worth like $5 a share then that's still free money. And I think the fundamentals of GME justify a long term price target of like $400 anyway.

But overall, I feel you. I'm currently up by enough to cover my bills for the next year, which is massive for me, but I'm trying not to bitch out too early and end up regretting it for the rest of my life. If the price clears ~$10k a share I'll be a millionaire, and that's the kind of financial freedom that I'm willing to risk losing a few thousand right now on.",1,0,1615298681,PiemanMk2
