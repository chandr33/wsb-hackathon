70,gpjpowj,"Yes this may be correct but RKT is not GME and is not going to go from $20 to $40 to $400. Buying around 40 and thinking it’s going up is a very risky strategy and trying to get the WSB community to buy into that idea is going to cause a lot of people to lose money. $35 is probably a pretty accurate valuation which is what it is sitting at right now. Sure it could be $70 but it’s not and FOMOing into a stock at an all time high is not a great strategy. Also continually squeezing the hedges is going to lead to more market volatility overall and lead to hedge funds doing riskier moves to cover loses, so watch stocks go up one day everybody FOMOs in only for it to drop the next day and the hedges to take in profit selling stocks and options, Mark my words this quadruple witching of March 19th will once again be a big nothing burger did you not learn anything last time. Stop believing the hype, do some DD, This rocket is not going to the moon, rocket at $40 is not a good buy regardless of what you or anyone thinks.
