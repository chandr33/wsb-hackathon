84,gqighq4,"Tomorrow will be a great day, as short selling will be severely harder.

Let me explain what happened today.

A trading halt happens when a stock goes up or down 10% quickly. For example, when GME drops from 300 to 270, then the stock stops trading for 5 minutes.

Then immediately, when trading resumes, there are not many buyers yet (as apes are still wondering WTF is going on), so with someone shorting just some shares, they can drive the price down
another 10%, making it seem the stock is crashing without much volume.

Basically imagine 10 apes, each holding 1 banana. Banana trading at 10 dollars. 8 apes are chilling on the side, and one ape sold one banana to another for 9 dollars. Halt for 5 min. The other ape then sold it back for 8.1 (10% off $9) right when trading resumes. Halted again. Even though only 1 banana is traded within 10 mins, the price dropped 19%, but is not representative of the actual stock price, as they prevented others from trading.

As the stock was more than 10% down today, tomorrow, the shorts are not able to short the stock at bid price. This means if the price goes down tomorrow, it's not because of shorts, but someone / institution selling shares they own. Shorts can only be able to have huge sell walls at a price higher than the current trading price, but then it'll simply be destroyed by retail and other hedge funds trying to trigger the squeeze.",54,1,1615422064,ripamazon
