2,gpjq642,KMPH short interest at 30%,1,0,1614788358,RoyalFlight7953
3,gpjqkha,The market is barely 7% off the highs. Some people are hedging for rotation plays and expecting slippage around the tech sector especially. Short interest includes PUT hedges.,7,0,1614788529,PennyStockKing
4,gpjqncz,"WKHS 60%, ZOM 40%, AMC 31%, NIO 40%, its absolutely ridiculous",1,0,1614788564,TonyPaulToTheMoon
5,gpjqviv,Still they are betting on the market to go down but the heavy volume is only in the stocks that wsb and other retail investors have been making money off of for the last year,-2,0,1614788662,TonyPaulToTheMoon
6,gpjrq0x,"i'm continuing accumulate LONG positions on $CLVS and $PLTR that in my opinion are both really promising

8,gpjsexb,Yes great time to buy PLTR. That's a 10 year hold play.,9,0,1614789319,ZeroTolerrance
9,gpjtrox,"No they are all stocks heavily invested in the HFs that are short on GME. They know when GME takes off those stocks will fall because the HFs have to liquidate to free up capital, and that in turn causes a panic sell amongst retail investors. Put simply it’s all correlated to GME and their will be a huge downturn in most of these stocks very shortly but they are doing it steadily to not rock the boat too much.",4,0,1614789889,Chaos_Ape89
10,gpjv96k,"Lol. Short interest levels are near multi-level lows. This has been written about a lot.

13,gpjyp3n,Ya some are crazy heavy or shorts that dont make sense to me (just a baby ape here) like why is walmart shorted 20% when it's been open all through covid? There is another company called utz that is shorted 50%?!?!? Its been in the green through covid too,2,0,1614791983,Doovster

16,gpk0z7v," I'm kinda new to the space, and keep hearing PLTR - could you maybe give me a quick DD on why it's a good investment long term? (And not overvalued at the moment)",2,0,1614792953,PineappleMechanic
17,gpk33a5,"Bro there's a million DDs floating around wsb on PLTR. The short of it is daddy karp is a big autist and his company is the first to make a data analysis sort of product at such a high level. They're constantly evolving and finding new markets to use their product in. They save companies tens of millions if not more based on improving efficiency. They appear overvalued to wallstreet right now but the idea is they are the first in a huge market that hasnt been taken advantage of. They've made like almost a dozen multi year, multi million deals already just this year.
(Not investment advice do your own DD).",3,0,1614793854,ZeroTolerrance
18,gpk3cwp,"It’s a tech company, that has several interesting products. It is founded by Peter Thiel (one of the earliest investors into Facebook, back when Mark was a dorm-living, crayon-eating monkey). Palantir does government contracts, things like terrorism prevention  (they have three main products, do own DD on it). Their demo day was just fucking awesome. I’m a programmer and let me you what - getting into Palantir is harder than getting into FAANG, in fact Palantir is on its way to join these letter companies. So Palantir is not squeeze play or pump-n-dump, it is very long term play, with billionaires behind it (Thiel and aunt Cathy). Wife got into it on IPO, I got into sometime later. Short term price fluctuations do not care about those, think of it as an Apple or Microsoft play. What I’m trying to say - don’t expect it to jump to 200$/tomorrow, but in several years it has potential to worth so much more than that.",9,0,1614793968,iAlsoFuckWithDuck

20,gpkdeqg,"This is not the same thing as short positions being held open, I would estimate about \~90%+ of short positions get closed within the same trading day.  What you're looking for is shorts held open for long periods of time, tickers that maintain high short positions for 30+ days are where they're betting on a long term downwards trend.

 If there wasn't any short positions on the market, then the entire market would only go up forever with no downwards pressure even under negative events/circumstances and that's not how the markets work.",2,0,1614798300,DerpyMcOptions
