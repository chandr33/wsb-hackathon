If you think hedge funds just in a YOLO position, and don't hedge, then you're an idiot. We caught some hedges with their pants down last month, and unlike apes with their single strategy to never sell, hedge funds have adjusted to new strategies. You just can't see how holding is not the only strategy because you drank the kool-aid. Unrealized gains are just that, and even if tons of people hold, who cares if the volume is still plenty. I'm not shilling, I'm making money off of this, which is the end game... I'm also trying to understand and plan how to make more, just like the evil hedge funds.

22,gqj955e,"First off, long holds selling high and buying back lower isn‚Äôt even remotely the same as covering shorts or dealing with exercised calls, so don‚Äôt even bring that into the same equation. The hedge funds absolutely have this hedged. The major HF shorters prob have puts bought on them by another hedge fund. They are all in cahoots so the major shorted hedge fund maybe then goes and buys calls on the HF that bought puts on them. Then all it becomes is making the dominos fall exactly when they need them to. But I have no idea, I‚Äôm not in that world. But one thing I can be positive about, there‚Äôs still shorts that need to be covered and more calls that can be exercised and that causes squeezes. Additionally, if all the retail buyers start selling, it causes a cascade down effect and the price starts to drop. Providing more opportunity for HF to get those shares and cover shorts. This entire situation is built on a team effort. But you go ahead and play your single player game and reap the rewards from us",2,0,1615437910,BigMcLargeHuge-

28,gqj9on9,"Definitely a possibility, but there were a ton of stop losses triggered along the way. Regardless, even if it was 90%+ hedge vs hedge, someone came out on top. Holding and never taking profits doesn't make money. At some point, long positions either take a profit or a loss. The same can be said about short positions. One side of this battle has a hold forever attitude, and the other is now trying to profit. With the volitility of GME, there is plenty to be made on both ends. GME is definitely going to be a rollercoaster, and those that hold are definitely part of the volitility, but eventually people will take profits regardless of how high it climbs. In-between here and there will be opportunities to make money as well. People holding can still make a ton of they time the top, but people playing in-between dips will also make a lot.",1,0,1615438282,lxnch50

55,gqjcutc,"A stop is a number you set to either buy or sell when the stock hits a specific price.  It's a good tool for managing risk. Like if you buy $10k of a stock because you believe it will take off, but really can only afford to risk 2k. You can set a stop to sell at 8100, and ensure you don't lose everything if you were wrong. 

A trailstop is when you set either the max dollar amount or max percent you're willing to lose before selling or buying. This is handy on a volatile stock like GME . I have a trailstop set at 10%, because I am not always able to have access during work hours. So if the stock rockets to 1,000 and then immediately drops back down to earth, I won't miss the boat. But the problem with stops and trailstops is that you can also get shaken off easily by an early quick drop and rebound.  I got lucky today, and was free when I got notified that my trailstop had triggered. I was able to buy back in at a discount. But if I had been tied up at the time, I would have missed the dip and possibly been priced out of buying back in to a stock I want to hang on to for longer.",1,0,1615440249,K_Andrew_K
