24,gqe31i2,"Your underlying assumptions are misleading. Wallstreet does not drive mainstreet. Wallstreet is only 1 indicator of the health of our economy, it‚Äôs not the main indicator either as people assume it to be. Pumping that kind of liquidity into the middle and lower class will boost the economy as it will get pumped directly back into the economy through the purchase of goods and services. When upper class gets hands outs, they horde their wealth and it gets mostly concentrated back into wallstreet. We aren‚Äôt even considering the massive tax revenues that the federal/state/local govts will get. It will also boost some people to come off of welfare which will reduce the stress on social services. People will pay their debts which will increase the liquidity in lending somewhat which will also help the economy. Real estate will also benefit as well as construction industry. As a matter of fact, more jobs will be created and it will boost morale. Hmmm kinda sounds like trickle down economics is all horse shit and we should‚Äôve been bailing out the small guys. But whatever, someone is gonna call me a commie triggered snowflake who wants free hands outs. Yea yea yea.

Edit: I want to point out that not everyone will be a winner. This isn‚Äôt a bail out of the entire middle and lower class. This is a bailout only for SOME of the middle class. There will definitely will be people who are hurt. Some will lose their 401ks. Some will lose their jobs due to certain companies going bankrupt. 

Additionally. There will be inflation because even though these dollars were already in the market, they were basically out of circulation. We can argue how much of an impact inflation will have but that‚Äôs a subject beyond my smooth brain.",2,0,1615334891,Rejectbaby
