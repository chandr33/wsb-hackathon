58,gqhjccr,"Not sure about the conspiracy theory... we may have just hit all the bagholders who were grateful just to sell with less loss/small gain.  


Then, trailing stop losses cascaded for folks like me who set a sell point on a subset of shares to protect the initial investment money (mine was set like 45 bucks lower than where it was at).  


I agree this is good though, if bagholders clear out, then the growth is real.",-1,0,1615406629,IlliterateInvesting
