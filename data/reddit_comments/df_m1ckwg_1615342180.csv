As far as I can tell it‚Äôs a merry-go round that can‚Äôt stop until the squeeze happens. Either they keep resetting their positions and the stock yo-yo‚Äôs like crazy from 40-500 and we go around again or they try to unwind their position which causes the stock price to skyrocket. They can‚Äôt leave without taking this hit as long as the owners of GME like the stock. 

This is assuming the short data is correct and they have in fact doubled down. I could be wrong. Someone feel free to correct me.",1,0,1615344940,MovingOnward2089

21,gqeqafw,"I did some math

If the short-float is 150%, and DTC (days-to-cover) is 6 days, and each day of the squeeze sees GME go up 80% from previous day's closing price, GME will reach about 8000

If DTC is 12 days, GME reaches 301,000 ish

That would cost short sellers $480 billion dollars for the first scenario, and $18 trillion dollars for the second

This is a big problem, and people don't want to talk about it, but how is this thing going to resolve? It's great for us who are invested in GME, but it seems to me that if these numbers are even remotely close to being true, all short-sellers are going bankrupt and will be bringing down the system with them too

Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy for the greedy HFs to go bankrupt, I am more concerned about figuring out whether the government is going to realize this or not, and choose to intervene with us getting our tendies.

Someone slap me if I'm thinking about this wrong. But it seems to me that no matter what way a short-squeeze happens, it's bringing down more than just the HFs with it

40,gqfntk4,"They hid their short positions in ETFs as well, not just GME. They are desperately trying to use FUD to scare us off the 100K, 500K, and 1mil hype train because they know it‚Äôs possible. I understand the skepticism here; it‚Äôs an insane situation we are in. But the math is there to support it all and HFs are shitting themselves. I believe they‚Äôre trying a positive FUD tactic now. Basically using their Reddit accounts to say things like ‚ÄúIf GME hits 1000 I‚Äôll donate blah blah blah.‚Äù Using positive sentiment to make 1000 look like an attractive sell point. This is BS to me; the actual squeeze won‚Äôt even start until after 1000.
