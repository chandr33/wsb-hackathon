It's clear that the CNBC article and price drop was timed, but what if a whale who planned it is playing both sides of this? So the whale would tip off CNBC, but would then tip off friendly whales to be on the buying side to keep prices above $200?

Said whale could have put out the hit piece to make it look like they want to fuck us and keep the narrative going, but knew prices would rebound.
