1,gqgkg1k,"Yeah that really got to my heart.  I work in retail and one of the biggest tragedies I see every day are older generations being forced to either work back-breaking jobs that teens should be doing or they're forced to depend on their children who are also struggling just to make any kind of actual career.  

My dad's very fortunate compared to others but even his retirement is on the line at this point and given everything that's happened hes been forced to pinch his pennies and is very anxious about what 10 years into the future will look like.

The worst part is....all of these amazing opportunities are collecting dust on his old ass computer because he doesn't know how to utilize the internet like my generation can.  Luckily, my brothers and I know a thing or two.

Got his feet wet with gme, but completely submerged him in a new currency, which I'm not supposed to talk about on here, but we all know what I'm talking about.  

Let's just say, he no longer has to worry about retirement.  As for me and my generation?  That remains to be seen.  But yeah we always scream at the boomers and generalize them but we often forget that they may be far greater victims than we are because at least we have tech saavyness, energy, and time to be inventive and change the system.  But people like my dad?  They dont have a lot of alternatives.
