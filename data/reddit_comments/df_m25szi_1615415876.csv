25,gqi880c,Made a similar comment with the same sentiment in the $GME megathread. That coordinated attack means retail is a threat. The whole run up felt off because there was very little resistance. Yes there were small dips followed by a quick recovery then a rise. It felt like there was something coming but when or from where was a complete unknown. At least now retail knows to what lengths the opposition is willing to go. That includes using a large volume of borrowed shares and a large amount of money. They've shown their hand or at least their trump card.,2,0,1615417781,lnfernia

31,gqi99pv,"Hijacking a top comment, Sorry.

There is something else known as divide and conquer.

NOK had less of a swing at around 5% which is a normal day. NOK is boring compared to gme. It's like watching grass grow compared to fireworks. -.2%on the day. 

BB only had a 10% swing and honestly that isn't anything compared to what we saw elsewhere. -6% on the day.

Stocks beneath 1B market cap should not be mentioned. 

AMC was beneath 1B, before the squeeze shenanigans, so I do not know how it became a WSB favorite. It had a 25% swing. This is worth a mention. -13.7% on the day. 

KoSs is still below 1B which is the only reason it got stopped twice. Easy to manipulate. It had a 35% swing today. +20% for the day. I won't go into further detail but there is a sub for KoSs.

GME, the good morning everyone, the main fn event had a huge 50% swing!!!!! 

I repeat a 50% swing!!!! 

With only a -2% for the day. Kind of funny with all the fud actually. People reading the fud are like what are they talking about its only -2%. That's nothing. 

This is not about how much 1 share is worth. It is a game of percentages.

Now are you gonna go diversify or go full retard?

Not financial advice I just like to color with crayons and count to ten on my toes. 

Oh did I mention I fn love the stock.

Edit:

TLDR 

GME retards are truly the ones with the highest percentage of diamond hands and KoSs should not be mentioned here.

Edit2: I implied only gme had diamond handed aped but the numbers show that there are some in the other trades.",4,1,1615418304,P1ckl2_J61c2

64,gqienq3,"Both, sort of?  By triggering it today it puts GME on the list for today and tomorrow which limits shorts.  But by doing it today it means it will be back off the list on Friday, so in a way that might help the hedgies.  On the other hand it limits how strongly shorts can push down price until Friday morning, which means loading up more gamma squeeze in the meantime.

Overall it makes the squeeze a wee bit harder for this week, but also means it will hit harder if it *does* go this week.",2,0,1615421092,TPRJones
