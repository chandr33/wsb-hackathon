96,gqc1u5i,"For anyone that doesn’t understand why US 10 YR affects the market 

The 10 Year US Treasury Bond is the gold standard, But there are others. When bond interest rates go up, the stock market goes down. It’s not just the tech sector. Tech gets hurt the most because those companies are usually over-leveraged (borrow more money) compared to other companies in the DOW or S&amp;P. People move into bonds as a hedge against equities. So the higher the interest rate, the more desirable bonds are.",0,0,1615302553,ElonTaxiDriver
