6,gq9tuc2,There is nothing that will be as easy as holding for life changing money. Not pay off your debt money. It's as simple as holding there is nothing left to do. I feell like it's going to be a big game of deal or no deal. Literally you against the fckn banker. What do you think you have cause they fucking know!!! Hold hold hold don't be fckn surprised when you see 10k 15k 50k 100k just fckn smile and watch it go do your own research see what people are saying on here. These dumb fckn apes are really amazing. I've never trusted so many people I've never known for a day in my life. But I take their info plus my info to make my decision. Hasn't steered me wrong yet. It comes down to how many people hold and for how long.,2,0,1615248511,Jolly-Program-6996
