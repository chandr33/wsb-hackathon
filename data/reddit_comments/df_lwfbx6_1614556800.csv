1,gph0y0g,"If you really want to learn about stocks, leave this sub. Stop talking like a moron, stop referring to yourself as an ape, don't believe any of the supposed ""DD"" you see on here, also the wife's boyfriend jokes are overused.

If you want to gamble on meme stocks then stick around and continue as you are.",-5,0,1614727194,throwawayben1992

5,gph2f72,"It is embarassing on a deep level. Its absolute drivel. This is a place where its ""ok"" to brag about the losses in a similar fashion as to the gains.

The losses that are bragworthy and sharable come as a result of someone who was willing to wager big, NOT because they were seeking the loss so they could post a screenshot.

I just wanted to gently point out that I fully understand that the stockmarket is unpredictable and despite winnings in GME, I am still willing to learn and to continue flirt with the market. I just needed some tips on where to start etc. since information in the internet is HUGE but quality is also important. I wasn't asking for someone to explain to me that losses are bad",1,0,1614728154,KaidonLeovani
