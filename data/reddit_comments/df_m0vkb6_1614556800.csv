32,gqb4t7h,"At first thought, it would make sense that Costco was HIGHER during the pandemic than at the end. People needed to buy groceries regardless of the pandemic or not. However, they probably wanted to go to the store less often and people were also panic buying groceries in massive amounts. Where do all these needs get met? Costco. Doubt Costco can do much better after the pandemic.",1,0,1615279435,FsPhys
33,gqb6f3i,Its lower now than before COVID started. The price was on par with how they were going back then. Now it is waaayyy oversold.,1,0,1615281061,Edmond-Alexander

35,gqb6r5v,Yeah but it‚Äôs lower now than it was before COVID hit soooo... it‚Äôs oversold at this point.,1,0,1615281405,Edmond-Alexander
36,gqb6xih,"Well it went from ath to pre COVID prices in a like a month or so. so once people realize that it has upward potential I‚Äôd say that yeah, it has the possibility to go up that high",1,0,1615281588,Edmond-Alexander
37,gqb7bgw,"You‚Äôre fine, add more. This guys response should only strengthen the fact that Costco is extremely oversold. Cuz based on predictable earnings and slow growth this price action has pre COVID mania numbers. It‚Äôs now lower than before COVID started. Sure they may have spent some money on COVID precautions but as we ease up and head into a post COVID world, people love Costco even more now, and they will end up spending less and less on those precautions as they still retain their customer base.",1,0,1615281977,Edmond-Alexander

39,gqb9ucn,üòä thank you for your thoughts.  I thought it might go up based on stimulus money news. But it looks like apes are buying stonks instead of shrimp cocktail.,1,0,1615284501,funlovefun37
40,gqbadbb,"look at a video of opening their first store in china and compare it with Walmart opening their first store in china. Walmart paid a bullshit of money for promotion and Costco did nothing of the sort, and the people stormed Costco like it was Black Friday in America. I asked a Chinese friend if he know Costco, he knew even about the deals at Costco even it has only store, I asked him about Walmart, and he didn't knew about Walmart even if they have several hundred stores in China, which is very impressive because few american companies can break into the Chinese market and get such recognition. The potential of costco in China, India and Africa is enormous, it's the only company I believe will 100x over my lifetime. Also I believe they have very good chance in Europe, Walmart got trouble in Germany because on how they treated their employees. I believe Costco will resonate here very well.",1,0,1615285016,cortemptas
41,gqbaf7v,"Fuck I hope so. I feel with any wide market pullback, like what‚Äôs happening now, with bond yields and all, money always recirculates first, back into the most obvious tickers. That‚Äôs why I say Costco is oversold right now",1,0,1615285069,Edmond-Alexander
