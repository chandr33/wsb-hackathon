47,gqapkzl,"The road to success is paved in failure. You're going to fail in life. A lot. Repeatedly. Doesn't matter; if one thing doesn't work try another. Money management is really all about budgeting. You did just get a red pill, though; that materialistic bullshit won't make you happy. Good for you, most people these days never figure it out. You might get some fleeting joy out of shiny new toys but it never lasts.

I can't stress budgeting enough; keep a budget. Save. There are people that spotted this crap years ago but nobody will listen. Now more and more stupid apes are seeing it and getting pissed. Cut your expenses where you can. Live as cheaply as you possibly can and pay off your debts. Then never borrow again.

Keep your head up and go get some tacos. Tacos are good. In any event the school system doesn't teach some very important skills. Avoid debt like it's diseased.

Tacos however are not diseased. Me and my wife's boyfriend go to Taco Bell every Wednesday and he lets me get the big drink.

In any event there are no get rich quick schemes. Some people get lucky. Even if you do magically get rich though, then what? Work can suck but at least then you have something to do all day.

What if it takes someone a half hour to commute to work? That's an hour they just saved from their day not going to work. Now let's say that person has to get up a half hour early to get charged. That's 1.5 hours saved every workday. Fuel savings for not driving. What if you worked overnight shifts and never got to see your kids? What if people hate their job? What if you dread going to work everyday because your asshole boss Jerry rides your ass everyday. What if that bitch Nancy that gossips everyday is trying to start trouble with you. There are so many more dynamics to this than just ""making more money the me.""

81,gqasw2a,"I've been there.  Don't let those things you call failures bring you down.   That aren't failures, they are lessons in life.  I was in the restuarant business from 97 to 2011.  I  thought I could do it myself.   So in 2008 I got a loan and signed lease. 

 Guess what happened right after that?!  That's right...the economy collapsed!

So I finished the renovation and opened January of 2009.  Lasted until May.  I put my 401k, all my credit cards, borrowed money from people and lost it all.  I had nothing.  My gf had to support me for a little while.  I found another job running a bar.  The owner did loan originations.  Unbeknownst to me, that wasn't a good career to pivot to do, but I did!  I tired that out for 2 years.  I beat the pavement but it was impossible to get a loan for anyone in that time. I made no money in that.  Oh and this work was 100% commission.  So I was bartending and collecting unemployment to get by.  At this point my gf became my ex but she let me live with her ( that's not a joke, that really happened)

After that, I ended getting my current job, which I love and don't want to quit.  I've had it for 10 years.  My struggles weren't over once I started to get a steady paycheck. In that time frame I had to payback the state for collecting too much unemployment, paid off a few debts and started saving again.  

But I also got married, bought a house and started to travel.   I have learned from what I did so many years ago.  I never look at them as failures just lessons that kicked my ass.  It's tough but it will get better and GME is the icing on the cake!
