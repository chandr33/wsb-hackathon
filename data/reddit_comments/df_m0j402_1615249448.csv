THIS. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I have GME and also AMC. But this thing is about to pop, right?

Picked up a call on it for 3/19. When I saw RKT and this heating up I was immediately interested.

Have never liked RKT - realtors I‚Äôve talked to (OK, literally the 2 that we have worked with üòÇ) aren‚Äôt huge fans and that‚Äôs not good in that line of business.

UWMC has been killing it since the start of this housing boom and sales continue to be crazy. Their rates have been so competitive - coming from someone who did the whole home buying/selling/submit 10 offers thing during this pandemic housing madness.

Then when I saw their CEO making moves buying large amounts of shares and going out aggressively - I pulled the trigger. I think this one is about to go uppppp!

Obligatory note to inform you that I know nothing about money and do not give financial advice. I just like the stock.

Edit: I just reread my post and realize I probably read like a bot or a GME distraction shill. Soooo let me humanize a bit.

I bought my GME back at $250+. 8 shares I think. Then bought a couple more at $120ish.

Threw like 8 bucks at AMC to pick up 2 shares. Wish I had done more.

Grabbed some penny stuff floating around for fun. I wish I hadn‚Äôt and had instead put that in GME, AMC and UWMC.

Nabbed an $11c 3/19 on UWMC.

I don‚Äôt do all the r-word jokes because I‚Äôm a special needs parent and it‚Äôs not cool in my world to throw that word around (even though I understand the intent here).
