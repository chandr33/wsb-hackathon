12,gqit0mz,This is solid DD imo as the chart seems bullish also. Iâ€™d be careful when buying cuz 5% range so ur calls can end up on a massive discount or loss if u buys dip/top. Iâ€™d buy off 255 personally and Iâ€™ll be keeping an eye on it. Only downside to note is covid is nearly over so their shippings and guidance might be to the downside,3,0,1615428646,ErectoPeentrounus

14,gqiuv01,"This a very good point that I think the OP is overlooking. Sure they can beat earnings again but now it seems the market not only wants to beat earning but they want even BETTER outlook. Otherwise if the outlook is lower, earnings beat wonâ€™t matter and send the stock tumbling",3,0,1615429613,XInvestorr
15,gqiv074,Iâ€™ll probably trade the run up but Iâ€™ll be selling most my bags and locking gains before ER. Itâ€™ll very likely run up as chart is bullish formation,2,0,1615429689,ErectoPeentrounus
16,gqiv7zz,"I think Iâ€™ll mirror your move. Gonna put money in for run up and IV climb but right before close, Iâ€™m dumping 75-90% of it for gains. Depends on how I feel. Feeling like 90% at this point",2,0,1615429804,XInvestorr
17,gqivv1g,Nah tax returns season is upon us and stimulus checks are coming. People are going to buy a lot of dumb shit. I work at competitor UPS and the first stimmy absolutely fucked us up for 6 months. Then Christmas fucked us til now. Shipping will dip a little overall but we are still busy as fuck.,2,0,1615430142,spiraldrain
18,gqivvlm,Heads up Iâ€™ve lost money on every trade I made however the two times I made a trade train on the OG wsb discord server the calls printed. Entering tmr before close or if it dips for sure. Iâ€™ll be throwing 20-50% of my portfolio in now that I have a rider on the train with me. Iâ€™ll just check to see historic movement pre ER to gauge how much of a run up and probabilities,2,0,1615430150,ErectoPeentrounus
19,gqiw0p2,Ty for DD Iâ€™ll still cautiously sell 70-90% of my holdings before ER. Very likely I switch to spread,1,0,1615430224,ErectoPeentrounus
20,gqiw3xu,Lmao you good bro. I did this same move with UBER before their shitty earnings and guidance. I have a feeling this is going to be the exact same movie. But for sure DM me what you find if you. Iâ€™ll be looking into it tomorrow morning myself,1,0,1615430273,XInvestorr

27,gqj4o4n,"Good point, I do think if you look at the history of IV the options are down substantially especially going into ER. That IV should pickup and the price of options rise into next week which we havenâ€™t seen yet",1,0,1615435117,KingCuerv0

25-30 year veterans have NEVER seen that happen, even during 9/11 shit still got moved. Be careful going all in.... FDX earnings will be messy, promise. One of the FEW companies still doing honest earnings calls.",1,0,1615436890,impulsiveinvestor

33,gqkkkyy,Ight just looked and it seems like they die right around ER lol. Usually not much of a run up either it seems. Iâ€™ll still buy some lotto tickets for next week 5%OTM cuz if it moves up as a pre Er run up I think 5% is reasonable but Iâ€™ll be more careful with my entry. Iâ€™d only go nuts if someone posted whales buying crazy amounts,1,0,1615469939,ErectoPeentrounus

Agreed, I should have framed it better than an absolute blowout but they will beat EPS. I think guidance will be important.",1,0,1615478587,KingCuerv0
