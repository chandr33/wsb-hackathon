20,gqhgsts,Saw a video about if GME goes the ecommerce route and you compare it to other companies they should realistically be at $1100,5,0,1615405549,TheJunkyVirus
21,gqhh4we,"Infinite so long as everyone holds. Eventually I'm sure the government would step in and bail everyone out, which wouldn't be a bad thing. People will sell though, it just depends on when and how much. So basically, not a single person knows how high it will go.",1,0,1615405693,ConsciousAd2321

29,gqitxlz,"Which is unrelated to the original comment. Obviously they're asking what they might be able to sell at if the short squeeze happens. I'm not quite convinced you're stupid enough not to understand what their question meant given the context of the last few weeks or months.

But maybe you are. How stupid are you?",1,0,1615429120,ConsciousAd2321
