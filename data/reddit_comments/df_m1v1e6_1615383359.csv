9,gqfzcts,"I mean if we can slowly reverse the old Reaganism- 'government is the problem, not the solution' way of thinking, then I think we could do all these things.  

I hope if Biden ends up running an successful administration that gets alot of things done and tackles alot of problems that have been ignored for so long, then I think we could reverse this thinking in the younger generations.  

So many of our institutions have been run down by this thinking over the past 30-40 years.  So much soft power lost and given away.",1,0,1615383372,Midnight2012
