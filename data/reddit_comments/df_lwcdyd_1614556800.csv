Example of how this could end badly:

$12.50 strike price on your call options, which you paid $0.50 per share for the privilege of having, or $50 for one option ‚Äúcontract‚Äù.

After a volatile week... Share price lands at $12.51 at market close on the date of expiry. If your broker automatically exercises in the money options.... you are buying 100 shares for $1250, worth $1251.

If the stock drops after hours or on the Monday open...well damn son you just lost money on ITM options.
