29,gqe1fpd,"Tricky question. Probably not the place to suggest this but you can probably start to consider leaving it in some boomer stock with normie returns and give yourself a 1/2 year timer for planning what you'll do as a millionaire. Or, alternatively, you could buy 200k of GME and roll the dice and maybe die a hero. Tbh there are a lot of yolo plays you could do with that which could end up with the all time greats. More sensible plays might be doing some proper analysis for where the tech bottom is and investing there, or investing into the digital coinage of which we do not speak here.
