10,gqffbhv,No it‚Äôs post financial crisis. Banks don‚Äôt float loans with a couple signatures anymore. In 2000 you could walk in a bank with a 710 credit rating sign a paper and walk out with 20K. Mortgages had what was called ‚Äústated income‚Äù which literally means you just state how much you make and they write a loan based on that amount. Not even show a check stub.,1,0,1615367101,mdewinthemorn
11,gqffohs,I can get a loan for 10k without collateral just by asking. Not sure how that is unbelievable at all,1,0,1615367422,WillTheDreadWolf
12,gqffsjr,Trust me you can still do that. I've done it. I don't even have a 710. I just make good money and make all my payments. Yeah they slap me with a shitty interest but they hand over the dough,1,0,1615367521,WillTheDreadWolf

16,gqfgydr,"In the 80s you could have NO paying job, no verifiable income at all, just an excellent payment history and the money is in your account the next day. 

There were SO many people making money under the table, or had no idea how much they would bring in month to month, banks had to lease/loan to people based on history not future earnings.

Need a car? Just walk on the lot with a credit card for the down payment and point at it. It‚Äôs yours. It was crazy lax.",1,0,1615368594,mdewinthemorn

20,gqfkvxl,Today the difference is you don‚Äôt need to walk into a bank.  You can close a $50K personal loan online in literally minutes and have it funded the next day.,1,0,1615372420,fishythepete
21,gqfm6tn,"Your missing the real point, they are going to want a check stub or some kind of reoccurring income. 

Granted you might be able to get a 25% interest loan from some swindler over the Internet, but I‚Äôm talking about a reputable lender at a reasonable rate.",1,0,1615373670,mdewinthemorn
22,gqfmlhu,"I‚Äôm not, and they don‚Äôt.  And try 6-10% which is nuts for an unsecured loan. I applied for one last March to see how the process was because I also couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it sounded. From account creation to loan approval was literally 12 minutes.  It took an order of magnitude more time to cancel the loan since the application requires you provide banking info so they can fund on approval. 

No one is looking at check stubs or doing any human underwriting on that timeline.  Google personal loan, or check out SoFi, Prosper, Lending Club, etc...  It‚Äôs the next bubble.",1,0,1615374050,fishythepete

25,gqfnps8,"Have you gotten a lot of loans approved that you‚Äôve cancelled before?  I usually apply for one when I intend to actually use the money, so it was a novel experience for me.

Either way, I‚Äôm not sure what them ‚Äútrying to keep me on the hook‚Äù has to do with your outdated perception of how easy it is to get a personal loan these days.",1,0,1615375065,fishythepete
