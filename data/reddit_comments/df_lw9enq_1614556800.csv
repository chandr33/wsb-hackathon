3,gpg0jnd,I sold all my shares (avg $18.90) a few weeks ago out of pure impatience because it was trading sideways. Back in at $28 now but I feel super autistic,3,0,1614711111,jacksub97
4,gpg0vun,its okay man i felt the same way. I had 10 shares at around 22 but it was a large percentage of my roth so sold half and redistributed. Its a good long term investment regardless. Definitely not comparable to GME's dieing brand/business,1,0,1614711254,Italeos

13,gpg2opp,I would say just eyeballing i can see this being a 40-55 dollar stock at the moment. But thats pre-speculation. If you add in speculation who knows what the people here would pay for it.... lol,1,0,1614712018,Italeos
