2,gqh3nm4,"The trades are halted because the price is dropping, not vice versa. Quick google search would tell you that.

Lots of big investors carry positions in both stocks, them trading in tandem is not evidence of anything bad",11,0,1615400188,VeRyOkAy69420

11,gqh3zyd,"Trade halts aren't what's foul. Trade halts are triggered, in our case, due to a price changing too rapidly in a short time span. It locks the trading on it, both buy and sell, for about 5 minutes. You can see halts happen both going up and down. Halts also aren't limited to GME. About 15 other stocks also had halts today so far.",4,0,1615400319,ItsAlkron
