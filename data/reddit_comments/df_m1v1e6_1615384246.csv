14,gqg0z80,"IV is effectively the proxy for price in the options model (black-scholes model if you want to look it up). All things constant, an increase in Implied Vol leads to an increase in price. Note that it‚Äôs called implied because it‚Äôs implied from the price.

The price is basically affected by supply and demand. If people are willing to bid up the prices of these options then the price goes up. Intuitively, this means that people are expecting future volatility of the stock will be higher. 

Market makers then delta hedge their positions. These guys buy or sell from you but take a neutral market position so they hedge. If realised vol over the period to maturity is lower than the implied vol, then they make a profit. The premium you pay for the put or call also includes the risk they take for making two way prices.

In short, implied vol is determined by the price which is determined by supply and demand. To some extent, is influenced by market expectations on sharp movements of the stock price over the period to maturity",1,0,1615384262,RatchetCliquet

20,gqg0zpy,Remember this saying - when stocks/indexes drop they recover and go back up - when stocks go up they stay up and go higher. Which side do you want to be - the retarded one that tries to make money on drops (when they just rebound straight away) or the perma bull who buys everything because we all know stocks_go_up.
