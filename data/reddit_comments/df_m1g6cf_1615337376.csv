27,gqe7th3,Mostly the earnings on march 26 the rest would be buffer  (there are still alot of news that could follow earrnings in my opinion) on the 16. April u got calls up till 800 so they are extra cheap.  On the first i think it only goes up to 360 so those will be a lot more expensive. If i had enough money i would go for 16th april 250 calls. But now I have 500calls fpr march 19th. Im gonna roll them out if we dont see anything happen in the next week,1,0,1615337413,Danilieri
