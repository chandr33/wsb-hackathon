6,gqh983v,"Nooo it went back from 120ish to 300+ that day. Diamond hands my friend! The goal of the short attack is to shake confidence and get people to sell. Price action is based on relatively low volume. 

Turn volume weighted average price on in your chart, it will tell you the true price of the stock. VWAP only went from 300 to 280 since the start of today's attack, and share price is climbing back to 280.",3,0,1615402389,FarewellAndroid

I‚Äôm almost comically bad at it, I‚Äôm nearly universally hated, and though I doubt you‚Äôre capable of realizing it I do not, in fact, know better than the community I could moderate as to what that community wants. Shit, just look at how I‚Äôm being downvoted in this thread - that‚Äôs not people saying that they disagree with what I‚Äôm saying, that‚Äôs people saying that they disagree with me as a person. That‚Äôs a whole bunch of people who dont even like me.
I get that some people live such pathetically unrewarding lives that the minor imitation power they get from moderating a mediocre subreddit makes things worthwhile to them, but at this point, isn‚Äôt it embarrassing? I mean, is the tiny little high I get from threatening to delete any comments critical of me and my  ideas really worth the shame that I ought to be feeling in knowing that the most popular thing that I could possibly do at this point would be to delete my account? What‚Äôs the point?
So, yeah. Go ahead and delete this comment now, and the countless other comments that will no doubt pop up over the rest of the week pointing out what a fucktarded idea this ‚Äúflair me mod‚Äù bullshit is that I‚Äôve arbitrarily decided to force on the sub is.
