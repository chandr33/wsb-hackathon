7,gqir4lw,"There are always shorts on a stock. GME still has some, but there is a big difference between 130% and 30% float. Lots of shorts made money today due to the volitility. If anyone shorted at $300 and bought back in at $200, they made bank. It might even be why the stock bounced back so quickly.",-1,0,1615427666,lxnch50

12,gqis7ih,"This doesn't pass the sniff test.  Let me try to challenge your outlook.  You claim that the short interest is substantially lower than in January (you used the term big difference); then why the massive short attack that dropped the price from $348.50 to $172?  It dropped more than half it's value (at the top) in 30 minutes.  It was a coordinated attack where they hit the bid side with over 700k shares.

Last I knew, short interest was a voluntary number reported by hedges.  If I was short GME and I didn't have to disclose my short positions, you can bet your ass I wouldn't tell the truth either.",4,0,1615428225,Jb1210a

Sure it still has the ""ShOrTs HaVe AlL CoVeReD"" groupthink, but even if he thinks they haven't he has to keep up the kayfabe.

16,gqit19e,"Short interest is available, who is holding them isn't. Did you even read the article? Short positions are also unknown, you can purchase shorts and hold them, they don't need to be put into play. Putting them into play at $300+ or when the stock started to tumble would have paid off. It would also explain the bounce back to $260 when they may have been closing their shorts off in short order.",-1,0,1615428655,lxnch50

20,gqitomv,"I did read the article.

Again, why did they drop the price as hard as they did?  Not being a dick but I am challenging the sentiment.  **Some entity or entities** are massively over-leveraged to have done this for what seems to be the need to live another day.

If this is all a gamma ramp, which wasn't setup by the average redditor mind you, then there wouldn't be a need to form such an imposing gamma ramp only to then dump 700,000 borrowed shares hammering the bid side (which were likely borrowed before today).",3,0,1615428990,Jb1210a

23,gqiuh0c,"If short holders all held and piled on at the high, then bought at the low, it would explain how the stock bounced right back to the beginning. There is not one team all planning and manipulating this the exact same way. My understanding is that you have 3 days to put a short into play from when you borrow them. Why not sit and wait for an opportunity like the swing today. It sure looks like they all piled on one after another to continue to drill GME down today, and if this is the case, start buying back that short when it bottomed out at $170. Tons of stop losses got triggered along the way and it gave any shorts at the top huge profits. It would also explain how after it hit the bottom, it bounced right back to where it started the day. Holding shares doesn't swing prices one way or another. Moving them does.",3,0,1615429406,lxnch50

25,gqiwbu9,"I'm confused, I thought the FINRA data from yesterday shows it's at 52%. Where is this 30% number coming from?",2,0,1615430390,30thCenturyMan
26,gqixio3,"I agree with everything you said, I just don't see **why** they would do that.

You mentioned if all of them held and piled on, that would suggest collusion between multiple entities in a short position and as such would be harder to pull off and reeks of market manipulation and insider trading (hedges all coordinating to short at one specific moment in time is indeed insider trading).

Or it could simply be that there are more shorts out there with highly leveraged positions than are being reported and as such are doing everything they can get to unravel their positions.  Maybe we agree to disagree but a more than 50% drop in the stock price is sheer desperation and looks more like a wild animal caught in a corner.",1,0,1615431023,Jb1210a
27,gqiy1tk,"I'd say it was momentum driven, but I can't say it wasn't a coordinated effort. Regardless of how it it went down, lots of shorts could have made a shit ton today. The problem with the ape mentality is that they don't take profits, this allows for more manipulation as hedge funds figure out how to profit from this, apes are more likely to be left holding bags IMO.",1,0,1615431313,lxnch50
28,gqiytfz,"Thanks for the spirited debate about this.

I think the profit taking is such a double-edged sword and a topic that should be considered but in the long run dilutes the dream of a MOASS.  However, at times I've wondered if this even makes sense to hold when selling by the average retail investor won't budge the stock a cent.

I think the thing with a gamma ramp is that it has a possibility of being a slippery slope in either direction.  If I was thinking strategy, a huge put option chain on the stock when combined with a horde of shares to short that have been borrowed over three days is a heck of a great strategy and would cause MM to delta hedge in the opposite direction.  But the point is that there's still an insanely large gamma ramp that could force the shorts into an even deeper hole than the one they just dig themselves into.",2,0,1615431728,Jb1210a
29,gqiz48v,"Yeah, if gamma squeezes work, when do we find out how to orchestrate the opposite. I'm not even sure how one hedges the inverse though, and if it affects the price in the same way the calls do.",1,0,1615431892,lxnch50

33,gqjzr6b,"&gt; Crowbars are so old-school. The ‚Äúapes‚Äù (as they call themselves) have chain-saws now. Watch out.

Interesting article, especially about the difference between a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze. But it claims most shorts have been covered by now. Is that true? Do we have accurate data on that?

(Honestly, anyone who didn't cover their shorts when the stock was at $40 has to be a massive fool. But they exist.)",1,0,1615455247,mcvos
