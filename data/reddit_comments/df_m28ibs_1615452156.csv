I'm a noob and not fully sure I understand options but if I was reading that correctly, I beleive could've bought the call and immediately executed it and then sold the shares for a profit. I can't afford to buy and hold a lot of shares at that price point, but the chance at that immediate profit looked really enticing to me.

48,gqkogvo,"Options have their own market whose value is very very highly correlated with the value of the stock but is still its own distinct thing to buy. When weird things happen to the stock price it affects each option market for that share slightly later. Usually that delay isnt very long and usually not a very large difference.

Every strike price and expiration is its own market. So when wild swings happen its possible for there be very good deals in one of the several options.

Its very easy to make mistakes if youre new though. I would recommend trying to learn and try out basic options trades on a single digit value stock and start with buying calls. If youre inexperienced, then buying and especially selling puts can risk more than youre expecting. Also if something looks too good to be true 99.9% of the time it is too good to be true and you have a mistake in your calculator. But if youre confident in your math then its definitely possible to on rare occasions find a mispriced option.

I also like to use the site optionsprofitcalculator.com to see my range of risk vs reward. You can select options and override the inputs to test out what were to happen if the price were to change in weird ways. That could be a useful way to test out what you saw and show how the trade couldve gone. Even though you missed out this time you could try to learn if it would be good to buy if you see it happen again in the future.",1,0,1615472040,good2goo

I understand your point. I‚Äôd say not necessarily volatile, but a low liquidity/thinly traded stock, which obviously are volatile because of the low liquidity. GME has such high volume that there would certainly be an ask within range.
