2,gqhv5pn,Not only did GME/AMC drop at incredibly unnatural speeds but at the same time random accounts on my brokerage app started coming out of the wood works saying we should have sold.

And they don't even need to actually generate the public support, they just need to generate the illusion of it so that enough people decide that it's not going to be the hill they die on if they oppose policy and law changes pushed through in response to this.
