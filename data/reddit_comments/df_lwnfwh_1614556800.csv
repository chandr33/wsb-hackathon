Also, it's not an across the board pay bump, they're only raising the minimum.  It's expected to affect approx. 20% of their roughly 180,000 employees.  Assuming those are all full time employees, that's 36,000 emp x 2080 hrs/yr x $1/hr = 74.8m in extra wages for a whole year.

The $16 wage be viewed as a good thing. If congress ever raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it will not impact Costco at all because they already pay their employees more than that. And remember, there are advantages in paying your Employees more (If a business can afford it),  Namely lower turnover costs and they can hire more experienced employees.

29,gpielse,"No, the guy getting $16 isn't getting $17 - they're not giving a bump to people who are already at or above the new minimum.  (As an aside, this is one of the big criticisms of minimum wage hikes in general - they benefit only people who were below the new minimum wage; and the theory goes that they raise prices, hurting workers who are at or above the new minimum due to lowered buying power and no wage increase)  
  
The billions they spent on the sanitation crap, well that's already a sunk cost regardless of whether the pandemic is ending or not.  When was this expenditure?  If it was after the last earnings report, I'd believe it having an effect on SP.  But if it was earlier than that, it's already been priced in.  
As far as food going up, I see that as a likelihood that more people will shop costco - it's likely to go up more at regular retail grocery stores.
