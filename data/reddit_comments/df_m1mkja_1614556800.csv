1,gqegnmq,I bought some April calls this morning... the calls didn’t move much (expensive too). I’ll add equity for a longer term hold when it dips again.,2,0,1615342140,starfirer
2,gqegrsv,I’d also like to point out that a bunch of the executives are at GameStop now so maybe that’s not a discount.,15,0,1615342204,insanemetal187

5,gqei607,"Lol nice DD.  How many stocks of CHWY do you have and how much are you down?

SITM is also on sale right now so I would like to plug that one.  I'm in it at $108 average cost and feel super good about it despite it only being at $102 today.  It dropped from 148 last month and is now ready to resume climbing.",1,0,1615342952,hi-imBen

12,gqeo4of,This company is a banger. It's going to absolutely slay the future pet service / retail market. For real. I have been praying it would go to $60 so I could dump my GME earnings into it and double my money. Gonna start averaging in tomorrow a little bit at a time.,2,0,1615346232,pattiemcfattie
