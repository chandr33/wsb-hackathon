&gt;Short sellers have to pay the dividend for the shares they borrow.  If Tanger boosts its dividend, shorts either have to pay it or jump ship.  Look at what they chose to do in Rocket Mortgage.  Jump!Tanger shopping traffic just returned to pre covid levels.  Since it's structured as a REIT, it's legally required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to investors.  The 2nd stimulus hasn't even gone through yet.  The parking lots are packed where I live in NC.Outdoor shopping is now preferred.   This is where people will be spending their stimulus check this spring and summer.  Also, Tanger is located in a lot tourist areas and people will be travelling like crazy this spring to make up for lost time.It's a small market cap company.  Not a lot of volume needed to pop this stock.A high percentage of the float that is short.  Tanger is at about 40% short right now.
