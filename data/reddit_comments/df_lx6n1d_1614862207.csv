Sure *if* GME goes to $800 but you're either talking about multiple circuit breakers or a gap up AH and people would notice and hedge appropriately.

That being said, your claim of the ITM call options exceeding the float is wrong. I'm not even sure how you arrived at this. I copied everything from yahoo finance into an excel sheet and then added up the open interest. This got me 134,706 total call contracts that would be exercised at $810, which becomes 13,470,600 shares. The total float is 69.75 million shares, and the public float is 54.49 million.
