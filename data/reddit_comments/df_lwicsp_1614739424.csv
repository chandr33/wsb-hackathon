3,gphpa7a,Thanks for that. I’m trying. To understand these options that make the big bucks and how much they cost I see you buy them 40$,2,0,1614739727,mrjamesoerkins

5,gphpfeg,"Check out my new account. 

Been lurking for a month. Did well on RTK today (made up my gme loss and more)

Not a bot and I fucking wish a hedge fund was paying me I'd buy more rkt and probably a little more gme too.",1,0,1614739804,reeferparker
6,gphpfgg,"🦍🦍💪

I am a lurker . I am not a bot.

I am a tard. My hands are paper mache diamonds.

I’ve gone from 53k to 45k in the past two weeks.

I hold the bag.

I’ll hold your sack too...",1,0,1614739805,nukerammer
7,gphphy6,"Even more, I’d bet.  This high volume of shares being exchanged is an excellent way to make money if you know what you’re doing and they know what they’re doing.  I do not",1,0,1614739841,BillMahersPorkCigar
8,gphpkr9,"Its also possible that everyone in america saw the news about gme rocket ship to the moon like 35 days ago and said ""wow i need to go check out wsb those guys seem to know how to make money in stocks.""

**that's why i am here

10,gphq1vp,"You’re right, but I do think it’s important to separate the two, and some of these accounts definitely don’t make it subtle",1,0,1614740127,LickMyCockGoAway
11,gphq24w,"Its my crazy personal opinion. But i hope it will be higher than today on thursday or friday morning and then i am selling before the bottom drops out. 

I think it will crash by monday but i am no expert......you do you homie.",1,0,1614740131,crazybutthole
12,gphqp9e,"Just be careful. With great risk comes great rewards 

With great risk also comes losses.


It's ok to double your money. 

It's not ok to turn your money to a bunch of $0.00s",1,0,1614740455,crazybutthole

14,gphs6sq,"I’m not sure why accounts are like that recently.
And. I say this page jump from less than 200,000 subs to 500k then 2 million and now 9million...
Now, I’m seeing many posts of irrelevant content to WSB. 

But surely the bots are here but a lot of people too... just unfortunate that they’re here for the wrong reasons now.",1,0,1614741152,Left-Fee-4315

16,gphsqnp,"Thanks. I enjoyed when the felt like a movement was happening for us. Now it’s kinda spiraling into “where can we print money next”.

People may have forgotten that “GME saga” was never about making money.
And, The real purpose isn’t carried through into someone of these random stocks in seeing being posted.",2,0,1614741434,Left-Fee-4315
17,gphsuo0,It’s the latter imo,1,0,1614741493,Left-Fee-4315
18,gphxl5q,"I’ll be very honest, my number one goal is to make money. If it hurts the hedges along the way, that’s wonderful. And for every RKT that did take off there’s been a ton of BB NOK SNDL, etc that haven’t. It’s hard to tell what’s what so you gotta be careful. But to your point, what I think is true is that GME is not alone in being something ripe for taking advantage of the hedges of and hurting them. It’s folly to think they’ll ever be beaten, but maybe what wsb will be known for is a way to keep them in check some, and that’s not just one one stock.",2,0,1614744064,nokillswitch4awesome
