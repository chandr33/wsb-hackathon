12,gpj77lj,"Yes agree. If you have after hours trading now is the time to buy. It dipped but is going up as typing. When open there will be a lift to 40 I think. This is not just a short squeeze. Rkt is a good stock for the following reasons.

1. They declared a dividend this week. They will pay you to hold the stock. I am holding 11,000 shares till they pay.
2. Had a great quarter report - one of few stonks that profited greatly.
3. Real estate is out the roof up as are materials. Thus, mortgage is going up too which is why they had a great profit report.

Be careful of bots and hedgies trying to distract you today. This is a good stonk that is going to rocket.
