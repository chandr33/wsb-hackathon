2,gpfml0x,"Didn't say it wasn't. You missed the jump though. This isn't GME. This will go up to 33 or 34, snap back to 22 or 23 and then lose slowly for 3 months until it is appropriately valued again. 

Not that anyone here is looking for anything other than affirmation of their dumb stock plays.

It was a good buy last week when I bought it. It isn't anymore.

Edit: listen, don't get me wrong. I'm holding it because of these shorts against it. But I expect it won't do anything and that a lot of people who were just sent here will throw money in and lose it in a couple days. 

My point is, last week it was a no brainer. No risk squeeze play. This week it's a high risk squeeze play. 

Also, PLEASE feel free to remind me how wrong I was in a week ;)",1,0,1614705069,dustinq1990
