Give it a day or two and maybe they'll drop down to $1.40 for the ultimate yolo.",1,0,1615248447,jrviimonya
8,gq9ts0b,Can you just buy fractional shares of GameStop? Because if you want to make money I would do that. $190 is cheap compared to what it will get too. The long-term stocks are all crashing right now so I‚Äôd just throw it into GME. It‚Äôs your best bet at making some money with $140,1,0,1615248476,Datboiicarl69
9,gq9tslx,"I have a similar story, caught wind of GME DD the first time around, had to wait 3 days to see my funds transfer/settle while gme was at $70, 3 days later it rose to $350.. 

Fortunately, this time i bought back in when GME dropped to $40ish, now reaping the rewards finally.",1,0,1615248485,GrieverXVII
