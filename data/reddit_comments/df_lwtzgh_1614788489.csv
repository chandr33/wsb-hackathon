1,gpjqylh,Lol I remember this. I‚Äôm still hodling on to the 5 shares I bought at close on that Friday for 328.99 each because I believed that the squeeze would squoze or whatever you would say.

In fact, I wonder if the current boomer CEO will be gone before earnings.  Any grunt level workers to execute the vision of higher level execs still need to be hired and trained.  Do you really think that they've had time to construct a credible plan that's not balls deep in hopium in order to convince big institutions (not retail who's already lapped it up) that they can be a 50-100B company, without a shred of earnings proof to back it up?

This is coming from someone who believes in RC and how much of the project gaming industry TAM they can capture.  But it will be at least 2-3 years before they can even half ass prove can earn that valuation with organic earnings. 

But what the fuck do I know.  I largely missed the TSLA boat and the same arguments of TSLA not having the earnings to back their market cap were around since 2018.

As of now we‚Äôre all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you‚Äôre unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you‚Äôre concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!
