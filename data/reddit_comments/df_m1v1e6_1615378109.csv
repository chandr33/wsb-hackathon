19,gqfrffh,"&gt;DR: My theory is that HF are manipulating the page to divert attention from AMC to GME so that they don't have to cover TENS OF BILLIONS IN SHORTS. We have seen AMC stop following the same trends as GME in the past week, after weeks of being damn near the same graph. AMC continues to go up in % of volume shorted while GME is easing off short volume (IK WHY, BUT STILL LOOK AT MY POINTS) AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN APES!!!

25,gqfrftd,"I dont have enough wrinkles to go into detail but basically it's just a buyer and seller making a purchase contract with a set price and set date in the future. Unlike options, these contracts are obligatory, meaning the buyer has to provide and the seller has to sell no matter the current market price. 

Its a true hedging move where both the buyer and seller are worried about market volatility in the future. To cancel this out, they find an agreeable price for both parties. 

Now how are these used in trading? When would buying/selling a future be an optimal move for you? Idk. I imagine its a suit move but you'd have to ask someone with more wrinkles and eats less crayons than me",1,0,1615378154,eltraplords8n
