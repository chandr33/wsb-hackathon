38,gppn2zr,"While I agree with your thinking.  It's a game of chicken.  Shorts can wait us out.  Or they might just throw in the towel.  Personally I think they'll cover tomorrow as the mark to mark loses has been piling up.  Thanks for sharing this.  Also - check this out:

43,gppnsm8,"A couple of questions. Where does the money go if the shorts pay it? Does RKT collect it? If my math is right, they'd have to pay $43m, which doesn't seem like a lot if they're in for $1b. I don't actually know how much they're in for or how much they're down. I hope you're right, but I guess we'll see.",8,0,1614900332,The--scientist
44,gppny8m,"This isn‚Äôt DD, it‚Äôs just wishful thinking.  You‚Äôre assuming the shorts weren‚Äôt covering during that insane run up where volume was something like 10x the average.  You‚Äôre also assuming that shorts care about a $1.1/share dividend when they know that if they just let the price keep tanking along with the rest of their market, assuming they haven‚Äôt covered, they might even make money.  Why would they let themselves get squeezed and lose hundreds of millions in order to avoid paying dividends in the tens of millions?  That‚Äôs all assuming they haven‚Äôt covered, and the volume to suggest they did cover is there.

I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball so RKT might boom tomorrow, but your ‚ÄúDD‚Äù is flimsy.",36,0,1614900411,MapoTofu_Over_Rice
