Investopedia says:

&gt;The stock loan fee amount depends on the difficulty of borrowing a stock – the more difficult it is to borrow, the higher the fee 

They should be drowning in fees right now, but they are not. We know the short interest on these shares is through the roof, even after they hid as much as they can with synthetic longs. It doesn't make sense to me. The only thing I can think of is that the lenders are keeping the rate down in order to help the HFs survive for a little longer.",1,0,1615254332,Maxamillion-X72
