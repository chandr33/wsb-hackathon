35,gpl1q8e,"I understand why you don‚Äôt believe in the 100k. We retail investors have never in history have had the opportunity for a trade like this. It‚Äôs usually wall street that is used to making big money this way. They‚Äôre the ones who own 80% of the shares in the market, they own every stock, they make more money in a day than all of us in our lifetimes. They would‚Äôve made a killing if they could bankrupt gme but they failed and know that there‚Äôs no getting out of this one so they‚Äôre trying to divide us and make us think that we don‚Äôt deserve it. 

It‚Äôs ok to not understand it but accept the facts and the math behind it. Realize that you *do* deserve this. That you‚Äôre not going to get the rug pulled. That you as a human have the same right to wealth as the big boys do. 

Hold fast and diamond hand brother. We meet on the moon.

37,gplbe2c,"But not like 10 bucks to 100k bucks... That's not a realistic trade.
Even for the best hedgefunds in the world, that would be a one in a billion trade. 
1000 is easily possible. 10k if things are even worse than we expect... but 100k stopped being an option when the institutional whales bought in on the long. They won't hold that long. 
the theoretical infinite growth only works if you control 100% of the stock. we're far from that.",0,0,1614813407,liquid_at
38,gplbkxf,"I guess only time will tell. You don‚Äôt know if anyone will hold anything for how long. You‚Äôre literally talking out of your ass and making assumptions.
If the rich can hold stock long for years then we can do the same. Going long on a stock is not a new concept. People held b coi n for years so, people held tsla. People will HOLD GME.",1,0,1614813503,johnwithcheese
39,gplc1g5,"You're making my point for me. 
100k is possible, if everyone holds to 100k. But as you just said, no one can know who holds how long. 
But you can rely on institutional holders looking at the numbers, not some memes. You can rely on people who bought in at 400 who are more than happy with getting out at a profit instead of a loss. You'll have tons of people who bought in so low, that a thousand is already far beyond their imagination... 
Not everyone will hold to 100k so it will not reach 100k. The squeeze-mechanics alone do not make that possible. It's wishful thinking, to believe just because you do not sell before 100k, they won't be able to close their positions. Unless you're a whale, you do not make the price.",1,0,1614813729,liquid_at

41,gplg0ur,"Investors own 100% of the float. Institutions own a massive amount as well. It‚Äôs all up in there air about who owns what but do NOT underestimate the power of the internet. 

We have individual investors from all over the world. People like gamestock. People like being greedy and making money. This is bigger than this subreddit, wsb just lit the match but it‚Äôs much much bigger than anything anyone could we could have anticipated. 

Hedges want to make money, not all of them have short position on gme, in fact out of the 15,000 investment funds only a few are involved in the short. The rest will pool their resources to buy up shares at high prices because the math supports more than 9 digits. The dtc can afford to pay 100k, they can pay 30m a share before they‚Äôre completely fucked. 

Gme trades on international markets, everyone has access to the internet and to the stocks. They don‚Äôt give a fuck about memes, people wanna make money. And this is a cow they can milk over and over again. 

I understand your perspective. I really do but you lack the imagination and experience to understand how markets work and I don‚Äôt have the capability to explain it all to you. 

Good luck with your trades. I‚Äôll cover my costs and then I‚Äôm holding to my fucking grave. Diamond hands aren‚Äôt a meme.",1,0,1614815741,johnwithcheese
