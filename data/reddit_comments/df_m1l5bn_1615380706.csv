0,gqfwayx,It’s not the realtors who are doing the paper work. It’s the actual people buying the house. There are no brokers with rkt.,1,0,1615381530,SouthernDipSipper73

23,gqijk8p,UWMC is the largest wholesale mortgage lender actually.  RKT is using their retail arm to poach customers from brokers/wholesale so UWMC issued the ultimatum knowing brokers are going to side with UWMC.  It turns out brokers don't like their customers being poached.,1,0,1615423712,AllNamesTaken10987
24,gqijyu7,Wrong UWMC is actually calling attention to the unethical behavior of RKT and Fairway poaching customers from mortgage brokers.    It makes those companies look bad and UWMC is going to bat for brokers laying down the law here.,1,0,1615423930,AllNamesTaken10987

30,gqiojd0,"Don't need to read an article. The use of FaceBook to make a video about their opinion of business practices and attempt to promote an anti-competitive behavior is frowned upon by any business in whichever industry. Hence, me calling you a kid. If you don't know what anti-competitive behavior is, then look it up. This is NOT how businesses approach these matters. UWMC isn't an angel either. Any business that grew to multi-billions of dollars didn't play exactly by the book either. No matter what you want others to believe. They all have some corruptive practices in order to gain that type of wealth.",1,0,1615426342,robertleeblairjr
