It also supports my belief that this will take a while, weeks and possibly even months (the DD doesnâ€™t touch base on that, but if GME decides to do a split or address their shares being over 100% and recall them, forcing the naked ones to be covered, itâ€™ll force an immediate squeeze). Regardless, this is the best breakdown of what I believe will happen:
