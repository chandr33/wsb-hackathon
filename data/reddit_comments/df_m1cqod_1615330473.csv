1,gqduhof,"Didn't use BBSes, no. Started out with a ZX Spectrum, then an Amiga 500, then that 386 PC. Didn't get online until around 1998, at which point I had a Pentium PC. Was more interested in games back in the day, though I learnt a ton through magazines and maintaining the systems I was using.

I take it you used BBSes? I enjoyed the Jason Scott documentary about them, I can imagine they were fun to play around in.

One thing I wish I could have gotten into was phone phreaking, but it was a bit before my time. This clip of Joybubbles whistling his way through the phone system still blows my mind:

‚ÄúBryan,

Thanks for the prompt response. 
 
In January, we made the tough decision to make certain securities positions closing only due to extraordinary market circumstances. We know not being able to purchase the securities you want, when you want, can be confusing and frustrating.  
 
We have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors including you and they exist to protect the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken on January 28th.
 
As always, please let us know if you have any other questions. Our response times may be longer than usual, but we are working to get back to you. 
 
Sincerely,
Eric

I know it's not the consumer world leader it was. But it has some serious patents behind it. It's got ownership of one of the most robust and relied upon OS's in the world (QNX). It's got entire reliable cyber security arm. They own Cyclance and it's range of products.
