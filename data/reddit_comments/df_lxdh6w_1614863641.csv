2,gpndxc5,I‚Äôm still on RH because out of all of the small fish  they are under the most scrutiny. They‚Äôve been given a yellow card (I didn‚Äôt see any other trading app CEOs appear before Congress) and so if they fuck up again I believe the consequences against them will be much more severe than if it were a diff broker. Also RH is about to get an IPO so they are going to do what they can to make sure public opinion is favorable.,-3,0,1614863811,Key_Ad_1683
