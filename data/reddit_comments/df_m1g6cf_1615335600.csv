Me: ‚Äúslaps bed‚Äù are you serious right now? yes i made 14k and then lost it, but it isn‚Äôt gambling. When I invest in the stock market, I learn. A lot of people don‚Äôt even know what a 401k is or does. This is a big lesson and I‚Äôm not going to repeat the same mistake. Doesn‚Äôt mean I SHOULDN‚ÄôT be in the stock market. You don‚Äôt understand. Why can‚Äôt you see that I do this for our future?

Ex: it doesn‚Äôt matter. The fact is that you gambled more money than you could lose. If you had just gambled half of what you made, MAYBE you could have saved yourself from that mistake and still be up. I think YOU‚ÄôRE the one that is being irresponsible. I don‚Äôt even invest and it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than trying to gamble lost money back like you have to do now.

Me: I TOLD YOU, IT IS NOT GAMBLING. THE STOCK MARKET IS FOR ME TO INVEST FUCK MAN HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT? 

Ex-gf: stomps and leaves and slams door shut loudly. I DO NOT WANT YOU TO TALK TO
ME ANYMORE IF YOURE GOING TO YELL LIKE THAT AND BE FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
