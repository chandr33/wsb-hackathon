Then when you have more knowledge use that knowledge to find a company in an area you know a lot about. Use your insight to help determine what you want to invest it. You shouldn't be investing in things you don't know anything about. You should be able to read a companies 10-K and have a decent idea of what is going on.",5,0,1615341532,bodiddlysquat26
