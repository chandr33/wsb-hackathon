53,gqi2ewb,"I understand that 100% man. I had to move out of my parents house in able to actually have a GOOD relationship with them. Once i moved out, me and my dad got a lot closer which makes me happy because he‚Äôs towards the end of his life and i want to appreciate every second i have with him here. I‚Äôm happy that i was able to get away enough to be able to realize how much i actually love and miss him in my daily life. My moms situation is just hopeless but my dad and i are closer than ever. Honestly maybe moving away from them could do the same thing. My situation is a bit stranger than average but i felt like sharing that might‚Äôve been worth it. I know you don‚Äôt get along with your parents. Me and my mom can‚Äôt stand each other at all but there‚Äôs still love. As long as you acknowledge that it‚Äôs there. You can still ‚Äúhate‚Äù someone but have love for them. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs weird about family",1,0,1615414966,DeadHeadSteve

So my moves tomorrow, probably throw my phone a few more fucking times since stash is full of fucking morons.

Got another email today from the receiving broker that said: Stash claims they don‚Äôt have anything. 

Call stash: we‚Äôve got them right here, I‚Äôm not sure why they haven‚Äôt been transferred. Just be patient...
