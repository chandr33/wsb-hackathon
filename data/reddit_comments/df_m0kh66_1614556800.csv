5,gq8bkam,"Because it‚Äôs not the actual value of them.

Someone that owns a lot is just setting a really high ask and the ‚Äúprice‚Äù is just an average of the ask and bid 

Bid of 0.01

Ask of 1.00

Would show a price of 0.50

The reason it changes is because someone else comes in and sets a lower more reasonable ask and then the average of the bid/ask drops way down",1,0,1615224016,IWasRightOnce
6,gq8bypz,"Not sure.

Stock price went up and it stayed at .08 for a long while then dropped back down. And it shot up to .55  for 3 minutes.

Can you explain how someone setting an Ask price would inflate a contract but be meaningless? Me no understand",1,0,1615224183,sophiestocks
7,gq8caot,"An ask is only as good as the bid.

You can ask anything you want for your options, doesn‚Äôt mean someone‚Äôs going to pay it

It‚Äôs not actually inflating the contracts value, there‚Äôs just no other way to display the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of a contract than a mid point between the ask and the bid",1,0,1615224326,IWasRightOnce
8,gq8f0de,You have to do a limit order. If you are doing way otm calls and f the price is at ten set your buy limit around. 8 or .7. Always lower than the bid that way i f it goes down you can get it cheaper,2,0,1615225408,Spare_Protection7492
