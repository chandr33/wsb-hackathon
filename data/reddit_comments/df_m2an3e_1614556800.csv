3,gqj6mwy,"I'm actually long CACC, shares from 240-270.  Granted subprime auto makes everyone nauseous to think about, they have been straight forward for their earnings reports regarding free cash flow, and their cost of borrowing, and I think they are quite undervalued.  My price target is 600+, I can go through the valuation if anyone is interested.  I did sell some CCs for $500 the summer for some of my shares that may get called away, but I'd write puts for sub 300 if that happened

\*They have been growing consistently

\* They are the best in their business.  During 2006-2008, during the financial crisis, a lot of their competitors were wiped out and they cleaned up

\*one of the board members was my b-school professor from Columbia - Tom Tryforos.  Very very shrewd guy who looks for price to value.  They have been doing share buybacks and he wouldn't allow that to happen unless he thoughts shares were undervalued",1,0,1615436351,stockboi81
4,gqkcymi,Cacc is the most predatory lender out there. I refuse to use them to sell cars to my customer because I find it unethical.   That's how bad they ream people,1,0,1615464918,mygloveismyname
5,gql1749,"I think your right about everything you stated. IMO, that is not the issue. There is no secret sauce in the industry- it is profitable which is why its highly regulated.

The company did correctly analyze the market and predicted their target segments growth. Surviving, 2007, or our current situation, is about having cash and I have no doubt they have access to deep pockets. Both of these factors allowed them to ride the growing wave. 

That said, if validated the claims have a material adverse effect on every front line of their business as well as their back end. The punitive damages may be much larger than they anticipate, their ability to operate both inner and outter state may be severly limited, their ability to package and securitize their loans after sale may be restricted.",2,0,1615478018,RedBeezy

7,gqmpxfk,"Just saw a video yesterday of Steve Eisman talking about shorting them (they're his biggest position now) and went down a rabbit whole reading about them today. Almost a 40% repo rate and pretty insane how scummy their operations are. 

Default rate from auto loans is creeping up. Especially after the unemployment benefits wore off in the middle of last year. And sounds like they're getting in trouble for scamming both their consumers and investors (looks like they're repackaging loans in a way that's misleading, prettttty similar to CDOs sounds like). And I think the slowed growth since 2015 was due to more competition (or at least that's what their 10k said)

The Mass. complaint was filed in Aug of last year and the stock fell off a cliff last year... any idea when the regulatory smackdown will come down? I wanna buy puts but no idea how far out. And the liquidity worries me like you said.

Good writeup.",1,0,1615505095,tugjobterry
8,gr1z3fi,"I would take my research as one of the many grains of salt needed to make a decision. Like u/stockboi81 stated, they have healthy financials, a growing market, and I don't forsee this bankrupting the company if they have access to capital. With the issues mentioned, I choose not to play rather than predicting what will happen or when.",1,0,1615841287,RedBeezy
