0,gpokyj7,"Nope. According to some DD posted last weekend, a whole bunch of short sales need to be covered by 3/19.  But even 3/19 isn't a sure thing, because if the short sellers don't like what they see by then, they can pay penalties/interest to deliver late. Every day that they push it out will cost them, but if they can get people to sell by sowing fear and doubt, it will be worth the penalties for them.

Best strategy:  hold.

13,gpp9hc7,I cant answer you either but I bought a couple shares of $SBH to hold long term about a week ago and it‚Äôs hella suspect that it was up from like $16.XX to over $18 at some point this week. Makes no sense except it‚Äôs held by the likes of Exxx Are Tea ‚òïÔ∏è,1,0,1614893667,Jule926

19,gppin14,"Delta hedging is a process. Delta is kind of like the chance an option will expire in the money. If the delta is 0.1, it wouldn't make sense to own 100 shares of the underlying if you're just delta hedging. You would have more exposure to the underlying security than you would probably want in the most common case.

At the money, delta is roughly 0.5 (or 50% chance of being in the money vs. out of the money). As the option inches more into the money, the rate of delta change is initially quite high, which is what creates the need to delta hedge as the price rises (especially as it moves past the strike price).",2,0,1614897827,critter_bus

It's a risk tolerance based play and something that should probably not be done with a substantial amount of someone's portfolio.
