1,gpmcnus,"The platform, Steam, is the best, you're right, but without competition, that statement is analogous to saying you climbed the tallest mountain in Florida. I wouldn't complain at all, until I start wondering what **I** could change for an improvement. The Steam platform does a terrible job of presenting what each user is interested in AND offering an easy way to see the popular games in my interest range. Instead, I rely on Twitch to find fun games that fit into my schedule and interest range, which is not a single lane. The same problem exists on Netflix and for the same reason: they have too much bullshit and very little vetting. But that ALONE would change all sorts of user interaction. I have to create sub categories in my library listing games I recently purchased, or else I might straight up lose them, and I want to know which of those game are premium titles. MY OWN LIBRARY suffers the same problem: too much bullshit. For clarification, I am not a creative person, and all of these criticisms might be way off point, basically, I am a smooth ape man.",4,0,1614833336,GroundhogExpert

8,gpmgfux,"Frankly if GameStop is going to go down this route then I’m team Melvin. I barely tolerate GoG. I pirate less games because of Steam’s features. SteamVR is so good that both the Epic Store and Microsoft store sells games that require you to install steam and make an account so you can download SteamVR and the games sold to you outside of the Steam platform can use it. Steam’s biggest competitor is the Epic Games Store that can only compete because it has Fortnite and Unreal Engine money. EA is like the biggest publisher in the US and Origin is no Epic games store because EA doesn’t bring in Fortnite money. Tencent is the only other company that could seriously compete with Steam if they wanted to, and they’re very obviously planning on it. Sure, it took a while to get refunds, and there’s no game reselling (which absolutely makes sense to me in a digital marketplace unless valve took a fuck huge cut on reselling transactions between users, like a way higher cut than 30%), but the Epic Games Store still doesn’t have a shopping cart, it still killed Linux support for tons of popular games, and it’s still trying to gain market share by just giving away free games. It’s like when Standard Oil (shoutout to Exxon) would build a new gas station in town, undercut everyone else until the only gas stations were S.O. gas stations, then hike up the prices higher than they had ever been before. It’s so transparent that this is what they’re doing with both Steam and Apple’s App Store that it’s frankly hilarious. What was I talking about? Oh yeah, I adore Steam, and I wish everyone in this sub a very red portfolio if GameStop ever does try to compete with Steam.",5,0,1614835773,CopeMalaHarris
9,gpmgqyd,"Steam does this. Off the top of my head, VRChat and Warframe let you log into their services using your Steam account. I think there are others.

11,gpmjjs0,"I'm not in the GME game, but if you want a long game and think GME game plan is competing with Steam you should gtfo and short the ever loving long-term shit out of GME. I don't think you even need to really be a Valve fanboy or anything to say/think so.

The competitors who are out there have largely only shot themselves in the foot by restricting themselves to their own platform and not distributing through Steam.

Nobody wants 20 different app stores the same way nobody wants 20 different streaming services. A bunch of people might be willing ""diversify"" their libraries across platforms, but it's not a small hurdle. I'm going to buy on Steam almost 100% even if some other platform has something, just because then I don't have to think ""which platform did I buy that on?"" when I want to play it. And I don't even really give af about all the digital bobbles that also rake in cash for them because many other people do give very many ~~fucks~~ bucks.

Pretty much nobody else even has anything like Valve's digital goods marketplace (chock full of assets that will never ever ""port""). Valve's market guy literally went to become finance minister in Greece.

Yeah sure, OP is totally right. IF someone fielded a viable competitor to Steam, they will make bank. Just go field a viable Amazon competitor, that will make bank too. Or Wal-Mart. Big tendies. The biggest.

I totally get those both involve tons of B&amp;M, warehousing, logistics, and distribution that isn't even a factor in digital distribution. If you gave me a billion dollars on the condition I start a competitor to one of the three though? Well, there's zero way I'm picking Valve/Steam as my competition. It's not as though everyone just sat around the last 20 years watching them crush it without thinking, ""damn, how do WE do that?"" or even trying to. Ask Brad Wardell (Stardock) how awesome it would be to take Steam as his competition in a billion dollar blank check theoretical.

It gets 10x worse when you consider that all Valve really has to do if you become anything resembling a threat is to say, ""ok, from now on, if you want to distribute through us, we're your exclusive distribution channel"". It's chicken and egg, but you're a dude trying to fuck a rooster.",20,0,1614838002,jochance

23,gpn6jlw,"Epic are stealing market share from Steam through exclusives (which I fucking despise) and lower fees to publishers (which I love).

The only platform out there to really compete with Steam as a ""one stop gameshop"" is the GOG Galaxy platform.

This is because it lets you launch every game on your PC from one ""storefront"" regardless of which platform you used to buy the game.

But even then, I find myself using Steam more often than the GOG launcher.

It's a shame as Galaxy is a better platform, but they charge the same cut as Steam.

I can't really see how Gamestop could effectively break into that market.",6,0,1614858711,FILTHY_GOBSHITE
24,gpn7e2n,"I think GameStop should do something like G2A and sell keys for games on Steam rather than trying to compete with Steam. This would make them the most recognizable name in the Steam key business and would tie their success to Steam's success, which like you said is basically already a monopoly on PC gaming. Also this would be much less expensive and require less licensing than attempting to create a platform for downloading and playing the actual games, not to mention whatever else they would have to do to outcompete Steam. They could also sell keys for games on other platforms like Origin and Epic and tie their success to Steam and Origin and Epic.",2,0,1614859362,findspeopleforfun
25,gpn7olk,"I agree, instead they should model their business like G2A and sell keys to games on Steam, Epic, Origin, etc rather than trying to create a superior platform for actual downloading and playing.

For years the only way to play table top games has been through brick and mortar small independent shops. These shops were largely only advertised by word of mouth and of varying quality.

What does gamestop have? Established locations, supply chains, and knowledge of the secondary market for used gamin products.

On top of their current focus of video games, getting to table top in a large way, and focusing on communal elements will establish grass roots connections and create a new generation of gamers.",2,0,1614860543,Kurthos

35,gpoli94,"Haha... understood. I just wanted to by Grecian hat futures when I heard that news.

Thing is, they basically manufactured an entire digital goods market. Financially, it has to be a boon. There are trading cards that are essentially digital baseball cards as well as ""hats""... digital baubles directly displayed/used in their games (and others'). This stuff is solely traded on a market they created where they get fractional bits of every single trade. None of this exists in any competitor and even if it did, none of people's existing collections would port.

Where's the viable Amazon competitor? Again, it isn't as though 20 years have passed and nobody has attempted to compete with Steam distribution. I'm just extremely skeptical that GME (or really anyone) somehow makes a cracker capable of getting very much into this nut.",1,0,1614883622,jochance

37,gpom8nv,"Yeah, if GME merges with Dave and Buster's or something, look out. 

The big hurdle they'd need to jump there is cybercafe style licensing for titles. That's been more difficult in the US for dumb reasons.

GME with cybercafe and regular group gaming/competition? Probably a very solid win. I bring DnB into it just because the GME storefronts I'm aware of... they aren't seating 20+ gamers at PCs at a time in there, almost no way.",1,0,1614883930,jochance
38,gpomoor,"Your point is fair that Steam has a pretty good moat, but what is IN the moat? Sharks with friggin' lazer beams on their head? Or just ill- tempered seabass?

My bet is that the Steam moat is based upon ease of developer partnership and a lack of competition that has deep selection of games. If that's the case then GME has to contend with seabass with lasers if they want to make money in that space. 

I do hold small amounts of GME (40) but am in it for the long haul because they can generate revenue in a large number of ways based upon distribution and access to entertainment moving forward. They also now seem to have a super loyal customer base.",1,0,1614884118,Cecilthelionpuppet
