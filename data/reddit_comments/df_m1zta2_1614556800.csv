1,gqgccur,"Sells will still go through just fine.  You may get a good faith violation restriction, but that just means you can only buy with settled cash for 90 days.  If it was pre-market the sell button may have been locked until you selected a limit sell.  The market sell button doesn't work until market opens.",1,0,1615389727,chiefoogabooga
2,gqgciur,"These posts stress me out. Why are you gambling like this if you don't even understand it? I'm not trying to be cold here but seriously it's really easy to avoid being flagged as a pattern day trader. I truly hope it works out for you.

And please do not plan on ""holding forever"" that is a guaranteed way to lose money

I wish you and your grandmother the best",2,0,1615389799,tetsuonevermind
