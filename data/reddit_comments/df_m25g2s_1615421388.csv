It would be better to find an article from the first time, since this is a repeat of previous events, but even then trading halts during a rise are known to cause a drop and resume rising, which is exactly what happened.

The timing is definitely a reason to ask questions, but what most likely happened is they have media on the floor of the exchange hearing about a halt in advance or if the halt was automatic based on volatility then they can just pull it from the Level 2 data.

But let's instead say there was ""manipulation"".  What do you think ""they"" did to price?  Do you think price is always legitimate when it rises and only illegitimate if it falls suddenly?

I'm confused why people think the media is corroborating with the hedge funds when the reason for the drop was due to NYSE (my bad)~~NASDAQ's~~ actions, so if anything they are in with NYSE~~NASDAQ~~, which does have a press center, so to me, the better question is whether they released the information too early to affect trading.",-4,0,1615423063,LatinVocalsFinalBoss

&gt;I do think that stop losses are a major issue no one likes to admit using. 

A stop loss isn't something you are required to use and it doesn't make you a better trader.  It is a tool you use in your order flow to help manage your orders.  If your goal is simply buy and hold regardless of price change for ""x"" period of time, you may not need a stop loss.  That's fine.

People that are new should not be mislead by information that just isn't true because you are assuming you understand the intent and goals of other people while misrepresenting the objective use of a service likely available to them that may suit their needs.

Your likely concern is stop loss hunting.  That is part of what should be discussed when using them and understanding how it works can help their decisions.
