6,gqhmgv4,"Okay, you're playing the ""AMC is opening theaters again"" trade.  

Before the pandemic hit AMC was trading for three years between $10-15 (because of continually losing ground to streaming services). So you're saying it's going to moon back to those levels in a post-pandemic world. Well there ya go, it went from $5 a few weeks ago back into the $10-15 range.",1,0,1615407981,Jainaisbomb
7,gqhnazu,"And analyst can be wrong. For example, Tesla. AMC has such great upside after the pandemic. And with theaters opening back up it’s bound to take off and hit it’s normal stock price pre-pandemic",2,0,1615408337,Bruin2024
