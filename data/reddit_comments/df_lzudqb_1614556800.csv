""Remove Impairment charges (write-off of Goodwill from Merger) and also Change in Value of Warrants (theoretical BS charge when stock rises), then $FUBO BEAT estimates on Revs and Net Income. The Prob is not the analysts - it's the wire services that move too fast to look at the detail - they don't see accounting adjustments, or differences in share count, and they report the numbers as Filed - institutions take time to see detail; Yahoo does not""

&amp;#x200B;

The EPS should not be a factor at this time because of two outliers:

1 The total share float taken into account based on GAAP rules is actually lower than the actual number – which means the “per share” number is elevated

2 Acquisitions – with the move to incorporate synergies between live sports and online gaming, they acquired Balto Sports, which offers fantasy sports betting platform and then Vigtory. Both of these moves were expected to lead to a higher cash burn and lower EPS, but this should be considered an ‘investment’ rather than a spend.
