14,gqcj7kx,Compare to Tesla - rsi ainâ€™t shit. Shills and Hfâ€™s made those indicators to make us think there is a top but there is no top - at least for gme,1,0,1615309134,PainMajestic
15,gqckizl,"Mate, the stock is irrational because we're in a situation that no other stock has ever been in. The closest we have is that one time 13 years ago with VW.

There's no charting, no history that explains this. Asking TA to model out GME is like me asking you to 3-d print a 4-dimensional object. Wrong tool for the job.",-2,0,1615309694,Faedro

18,gqcoy5w,I am a bot. This Chart does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615311626,VisualMod
