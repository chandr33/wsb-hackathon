16,gqgjt62,"Time for everyone to downvote me for my super-unpopular opinion, but:

I think now is a decent time to take profits around $290.

To provide some truth-bombs that you don't want to hear:

* The valuation is getting quite stretched here.
* Short interest has died down.  The major short squeeze play has come and gone.
* **You are not sticking it to hedge funds.**  Sure, maybe you stuck it to Melvin Capital.  But many other hedge funds are long and getting rich off this.
* Your greatest adversary is not shorts anymore.  **Your greatest adversary is now each other. O**ther long institutions and your peers will silently sell and not post about it.  Everyone, including you, will have to sell at some point to make any money.  That's the whole point.
* Thus, you are all now caught in a prisoner's dilemma with each other.
* **Not everyone saying anything cautious about GME is a paid shill.**  I'm not.  I don't have a bearish position.  Many others aren't.  Just trying to talk some sense.  And for every ""paid shill trying to spread FUD to benefit the hedgies"", there are probably many more ""paid shills trying to cheerlead you on so that long hedgies can unload their psoitions on you at a higher price and leave you holding the bag.""
* **Realize that GME is a cult.**  Don't drink too much of the kool-aid.  Don't employ mental gymnastics to justify your positions.  The greediest and most idealist diamond hands true-believers at heart who refuse to sell at any price will sadly be the biggest bagholders at the end of all this.
