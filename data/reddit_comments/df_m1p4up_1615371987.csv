30,gqfqbkc,"&gt; The other factor is that new shorts opened positions on the way down from $480

I've heard this a lot, but there were zero shares available to borrow (and the interest rate was 24% at the time) when this went over 300, and until it was back in the $90 range. 

Thus, it seems that the shares could not be shorted in any meaningful amount at 400+.",1,0,1615377274,Lanessar

40,gqfr5hn,"My hypothesis:

First gamma squeeze driven heavily by retail action and unexpected.  A lot of retail went in and held.  

This time around, the action is from the institutions.  Retail already has a lot of capital locked up in GME. You can see the price increases are controlled to prevent halts.  My guess is that there is an institutional battle right now.  Some are trying to bring the price down, others are steadily bringing the price up.

The January gamma was unexpected.  This time, both sides are prepared and have a gameplan.  That's why we see this steady climb.  This steady climb is taking us towards the precipice without the halts.  Once at the precipice, all bets are off and no one can predict exactly how it will unfold because of retail's volatility.",1,0,1615377931,c-digs
