1,gqh53on,If we own 1/2 of the floating stock. And we like the stock. Can we just leave GME/ AMC and others alone? Why are they doing this? We get to 1000 USD (because of the demand only) then the company fails **MAYBE** and we go back to 10 USD. So what? Really?,5,0,1615400753,coty13

19,gqh53vg,"I suffered the same on another sick this morning. Watched it trickle downward for a week and averaged down as best I could. Decided to sell at a spike this morning with the intention of buying back in at a lower price. But if course it wasn't a spike, that fucker just kept going up and I bought back in at a loss. 

As for GME, I just bought 10 shares at $346, right before the plummet. It scared the shit out of me but I waited for the bounce and bought 10 more at $185. It's all or nothing now, I already paper handed after buying 54 at $270, this was after the peak in January.. Sold them all at $76. It was fucking bridal seeing it climb back up again. Decided to try day trading on the volitility last week, made myself $38 dollars profit, ran out of day trades then watched it soar haha. Absolutely no luck. 

I hope you come out of this with profits. Fuck these downvoters man.",1,0,1615400755,MoMonkeyMoProblems

I still have some humanity left in me unlike so many others who care about no one but themselves.

You attacked me and insulted me simply because I am trying to warn other people about what's really going on here. The smart money will dump on the dumb money...over and over and over again. The ""bots"" you're so worried about? ARE ON YOUR SIDE. They're downvoting any comment that warns people that this is a pump and dump almost instantly.
