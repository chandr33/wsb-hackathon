1,gqh53on,If we own 1/2 of the floating stock. And we like the stock. Can we just leave GME/ AMC and others alone? Why are they doing this? We get to 1000 USD (because of the demand only) then the company fails **MAYBE** and we go back to 10 USD. So what? Really?,5,0,1615400753,coty13

19,gqh53vg,"I suffered the same on another sick this morning. Watched it trickle downward for a week and averaged down as best I could. Decided to sell at a spike this morning with the intention of buying back in at a lower price. But if course it wasn't a spike, that fucker just kept going up and I bought back in at a loss. 

As for GME, I just bought 10 shares at $346, right before the plummet. It scared the shit out of me but I waited for the bounce and bought 10 more at $185. It's all or nothing now, I already paper handed after buying 54 at $270, this was after the peak in January.. Sold them all at $76. It was fucking bridal seeing it climb back up again. Decided to try day trading on the volitility last week, made myself $38 dollars profit, ran out of day trades then watched it soar haha. Absolutely no luck. 

I hope you come out of this with profits. Fuck these downvoters man.",1,0,1615400755,MoMonkeyMoProblems

You attacked me and insulted me simply because I am trying to warn other people about what's really going on here. The smart money will dump on the dumb money...over and over and over again.
