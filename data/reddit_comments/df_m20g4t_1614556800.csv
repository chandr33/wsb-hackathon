4,gqgpmzl,"It would've made more sense to buy the 22.5$ instead of 25$.

The upside for the 22.5 will be higher since they're both literally at .05 on the ask and 0 for the bid",2,0,1615395088,Snurtysnurts
5,gqgsxew,"At the time I bought the contracts, the cost was different. 0.05 vs 0.08. But I only have 4 25c that are kinda far off. I'm betting mostly on the 20c betting ITM

EDIT: The ramp picks up at $15, which is looking more and more likely. If that gets hit, I think this move will pay off nicely :)",1,0,1615396421,aster__
