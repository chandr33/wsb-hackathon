2,gq9d58u,This market has made me completely depressed. Was up so much on tech and renewable stocks and just didn‚Äôt take profit. Maxed out my margin and kept throwing everything I had trying to get rich. Now it‚Äôs down 60% and I legit don‚Äôt have any hope. I could of out all that money into a safe etf or apple and just sat and enjoyed my life. I really fucked up and really don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to get over this feeling.
