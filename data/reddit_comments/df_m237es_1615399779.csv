So there are more open Calls in the money than available shares to be delivered. Systemic issue for some participants. They will take all possible actions to ensure as many Calls expire worthless on Friday as possible until those Calls close out. Max pain on the chain is real.",20,0,1615399780,glitterpile12

3,gqh2ktv,"We knew this would happen, that they would try to short the stock to make us think ""oh that's it, that was the squeeze""
  
What they actually just did what fuck themselves over a hundred times. 

GME dipped -19%, and if you remember, a 10% drop from previous close at any time during the day places it on the short sale restriction list -- which means they can only short on upticks today and tomorrow
  
They're still trying to sell at this time to shake paper hands out and kill momentum, they were hoping for a bigger impact, but all they were able to do was drop the price down to what it was yesterday 
  
I'm fucking buying more.
