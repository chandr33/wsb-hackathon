I have seen a lot of posts and I mean A LOT of posts talking about Friday been a day that $GME is going to squeeze.
I need you to understand that nobody knows exactly what date this is going to happen. By posting certain dates you are just setting yourself up for a potential disappointment. Do not let a date get stuck in your head. 
#NotoFUD 

Most of you already know this, but for the rest... 

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.  Or even talking about puts. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week that we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN SOON. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK 

Not financial advice.

14,gqfqczt,"I genuinely believe that this is not like the last time. This time we end up fucking each other rather than hedge funds when this hype dies down. All because the short percentages are less comparatively.
