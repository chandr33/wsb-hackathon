96,gqhzc5f,"I know no one want's to hear this here, and I am still holding all my shares after today's madness, but I think today signaled the start of a pattern reversal.  Now is it entirely possible we achieve new heights tomorrow?  Yes absolutely.  Do I think we will close lower tomorrow than open?  Yes I do.

I think we are prime for a slide back to the $130-$150 range before we run up again to the $200-$300 range for earnings.  Monthly RSI is 75 (overbought) while the daily is oversold (45).  We finished under VWAP today but if you like candlestick patterns today marked one hell of an evening start doji.  It's the first red candlestick we've had in 8 trading days (despite being up %).

I don't think the squeeze is happening as fast as people think.  I genuinely believe the last two weeks have been price discovery in anticipation of GME earnings, CEO reshuffling, company restructuring, etc.  Awesome catalysts for the stock, and it's forcing out shorts for sure.  But I don't think we hit $1000 in the coming days.  More likely this bleeds up for months like Tesla did while bigger traders make money on the swings as retail soaks up more of the available float.   Some people made a shit ton of money today from that action and it wasn't us.",-12,0,1615413546,TheTrueVanWilder
