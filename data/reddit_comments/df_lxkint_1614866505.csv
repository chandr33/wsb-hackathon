19,gpnivf5,"Seriously? Putting a megathread of a pnd stock thats about to be dumped was a mistake. Forgetting gme thread but pushing rkt looked like baiting noobs into fomo.

And this new way is not so good either, even if Iappreciate the effort. It will chosen be according to what was mentionned the day before,  and when its mentionned a fucking lot and already got the hype, its generally about to get dumped.

Megathreads are about to become baits to fomo and support groups for people who got in late? 

I dont know .. not so sure about all these megathreads. I get why its done and it does help clearing the sub but it also harms people more than it seems to help. At least right now.",1,0,1614866533,jfwelll
