6,gqbqj3v,"#RBLX direct listing tomorrow

Should you buy? Fuck no. It's been around forever and probably peaked in revenue and active users lastbyear due to the pandemic. And how much revenue did they do? 550m. And their expenses went through the fucking roof leaving them with a 200m loss. Their direct listing value? 40bn. How the fuck are they going to grow their company? Everybody already knows about roblox and pretty much their entire target market already plays it. They would need a fucking miracle to justify that valuation.
