1,gpgrggh,Happy to bring it to your attention.,2,0,1614722639,guyatwork37
2,gpgrmp7,I have a painfully short attention span. I don’t believe this stock has the volume to keep me entertained. 🤷‍♀️,1,0,1614722718,InsipidGamer
3,gpgrrr6,"Yeah, it's not a monster stonk 🚀🌕 by next week play, but it's a mid to long term significant gainer I think.",3,0,1614722780,guyatwork37
4,gpgrupn,i would rather bull with you on this stonk,3,0,1614722819,harharharjar

7,gpgsgcg,Unlike RKT this company doesn’t have much volume or short interest. Monthly is bullish but it’s up 150% since nov. it does look bullish af but not something I’d risk. For big plays like RKT u have to get in before the stock moves or simply keep buying FOMO while short interest is high,0,0,1614723097,ErectoPeentrounus
8,gpgsrl3,"This is a different play than RKT to be fair.  It's more kid to long term significant gain, than monster stonk get rich by next week. But maybe get rick by next week with $GME and $RKT and 💎✋this for 9 to 12 months?",0,0,1614723242,guyatwork37
9,gpgsv2a,I respect that. And I respect your DD 😁,3,0,1614723287,InsipidGamer
10,gpgt2dz,Thanks!  Wanted to give it a shot since I saw the dividend released last week and then a lot of noise made about the RKT dividend (amongst other things if course) and thought I'd bring it to people's attention.,2,0,1614723382,guyatwork37
11,gpgupif,U mentioned RKT as a comparison so I felt the need to point out the difference,1,0,1614724161,ErectoPeentrounus
12,gpgvv23,This thing is already up 4X since March 2020.  Better ops elsewhere until this one pulls back,3,0,1614724714,IAintInTheClub
13,gpgw2ls,For sure. I think it could easily double again in the next year or two but is not 4x again for along time I wouldn't think. Although the have a history of acquisitions that continues to bolster income and revenue,1,0,1614724814,guyatwork37
14,gpgw9vt,I understand for sure. I was more referencing the dividend as a comparison.,1,0,1614724909,guyatwork37
