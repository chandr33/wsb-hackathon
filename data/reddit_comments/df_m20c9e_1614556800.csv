9,gqgfroz,"It will likely reach $300 today or in after market. But very few people think the market will stop growing and head south this week. Stimulus is approved today but won’t reach people’s bank until MAYBE Friday. I think it still has room to grow but will face resistance at $420.69.

Not financial advice, I literally don’t have a penny invested in GME but $300 seems like a pretty low ball at this point. Feel out the market when people get their checks tho.",1,0,1615391234,sycophantasy
