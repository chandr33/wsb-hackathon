22,gqheqqf,"~~Your claim is that the hedge funds don't care what the price the stock is trading at. Any funds that have borrowed shares to short cares *very much* about the price of the shares.~~
 
~~If they short their borrowed shares, they don't make money unless the price drops low enough for them to buy it back and return to the lender.~~
 
~~Again, you're right in that the schizophrenic takes regarding any slight dip being a conspiracy are.. Well.. Schizo as fuck.. But to take that and then argue that a short seller doesn't care if it trades at $5k or $5 is just as ridiculous.~~
 
~~Maybe you phrased your comment in a weird way by accident, but I don't see how that can possibly be the case. The entire reason the price is increasing is because other hedge funds (with retail hanging on) decided to capitalize on the short sellers practically begging to get a fist in their ass given how aggressively they were shorting the stock. They stand to lose a shit load of money if they can't drive the price down, especially given the fact that a shit load of call options are on track to expire ITM on Friday.~~
  
~~It's not every hedge fund (since we wouldn't be seeing the leaps without some on our side of the bet), but they certainly *do* give a shit about the price.~~.

SSR triggers at 10% drop from that.

246.90 * 0.9 = 222.21

So yes, we triggered it.

Important that it does not have to *close* 10% down, if it drops 10% of the prior day's close it triggers immediately and is in effect for the rest of the trading period plus the following day.
