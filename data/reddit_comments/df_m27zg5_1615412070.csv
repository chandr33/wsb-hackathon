5,gqhvzn4,"Just a friendly reminder, when they shorted the shit out of these stocks between $5-15, they didn't plan to cover and were counting on GME going bankrupt, and their shorts disappearing with that. 

They couldn't afford to cover their positions at $15. 

How could they even begin to at $38? At $100? $198? There's a reason they're trying to beat it into you that this is dead. Why try so hard if they're not worried about it?",16,0,1615412073,_Exordium

23,gqhw0f8,"Dude you're so wrong. Look at any stock on the market at 12:14 (especially in tech).

And you will see a huge drop in all of them. It was just a big player cashing out (potentially something to do with the treasury bond but that shit is way above my head).

The more volatile/small cap the stock the more they dropped, GME dropped so hard so fast because the actual amount of shares being traded is so low thanks to the diamond hands.
