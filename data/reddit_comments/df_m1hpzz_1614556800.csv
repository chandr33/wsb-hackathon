4,gqdpu3u,"Why exactly are you bullish long term? How is roblox valued at almost 30B and epic games is only valued at ~18B? Just confused how it could be valued so high when Activision is 70B and EA is 37B

21,gqdveea,Most obvious short opportunity ever over the long term. The multiple is insane because they had huge growth in 2020 (it’s a video game and everyone was locked at home). With the economy reopening the growth rate will plummet as will their multiple. Bond yields rising will crush it even further. There is nothing but downside on the horizon.,3,0,1615330944,chedrich446

27,gqe0su3,I know I want in but I also don't want to fomo into a high price. I genuinely think they have a shot at being the future metaverse and I want a piece. If I can get in for ~$45 I'll be happy (even though the shares have basically no voting rights).,2,0,1615333711,fortnitelawyer

37,gqhxv5g,It's more of a site that hosts games made with its own engine than an actual game by itself. Did I mention it's also insanely popular with kids and has captured what is probably a comparable or even larger audience on youtube than Minecraft?,1,0,1615412899,SerialMurderer
38,gqi1c49,I’m very familiar with the game and the company. They used to be a customer of mine. None of the things you said negate the fact that they have less than $1B revenue and the company is being valued at $40B. That’s nonsense. Unless they can maintain the same growth rate they did last year (it’s not possible) this is going to come crashing down. Just because you like a game is not reason to buy it at any price.,1,0,1615414456,chedrich446
