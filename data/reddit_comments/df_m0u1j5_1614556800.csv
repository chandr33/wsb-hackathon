We dont say the word meme anymore. 
It is effectively  DEAD. 

If they want to use that against us we will stop saying it and start bashing people  who still do meme. 

Meme will not be held against me me.",14,0,1615248968,danmtitsmang442
1,gq9v1d1,"Interesting considering short % of the actual indices is at an all time low now too. Now even less. I can't tell what makes stocks go up faster, all growth with no short pressure or a single price spike once a week to cause shorts to cover. 

From what it sounds like, almost all of TSLA's stock price rise in the past year has been fueled by shorts constantly covering.",7,0,1615249159,JinnPhD

13,gqa02fn,"eh I wouldn't call it the hard and fast truth, just that historically tsla has dealt by far the largest blows to short sellers and yet they never let up. It's just my best guess as to why its rocket rocketed so much.

Actually better evidence, TSLA 08/14 to 08/30 shares shorted went from 15m ish to 60m. Price went up over a hundred per share despite the short. Probably started covering.",4,0,1615251904,JinnPhD

15,gqa0zk9,"It was certainly the catalyst, but the real reason Tesla went up so high was because they played it well.

They let the stock ride up and then issued a stock split. This earned them anough liquidity to pay for their factory infrastructure with cash. At which point they were an electric car manufacturer with low loans to assets, cash in the bank and loads of positive sentiment. Their fundamentals were great, and because of the stock split their share price was now low, they became a great investment and people piled on.

If GME issues a 10:1 stock split at $1k, people may moan but it will be the most bullish thing they could do. Their fundamentals would go through the roof and with a low(er) share price institutional investors would pile on pushing the price back up. It would make us rich, and the company richer.",7,0,1615252410,Catch_0x16

30,gqbw2pr,"Either stock does not mean what you think it does, or it doesn't mean, or you are referring to something different.

Stock split, in my book, is when a company increases the number of actions while reducing the price per action. 

It does not generate money in may way. Unless at the same time you are increasing capital by issuing new shares. In which case is not a split.",1,0,1615300018,pocman512
31,gqc05zg,"Ah, you are right. I've done a silly and conflated two things in my head, thanks for pointing it out. Yes, a stock split is different from issuing more shares. It increases the accessibility of the stock to smaller investors (although, arguably not necessary with fractional shares being the norm now), whereas issuing more stock is how the company would make money.  


I stand corrected, and thank you for pointing out that error, please accept my reward.",1,0,1615301860,Catch_0x16
