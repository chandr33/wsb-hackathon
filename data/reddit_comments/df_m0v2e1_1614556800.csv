6,gqa2j86,you can all call me crazy but Palantir was not used to kill Bin Laden. Maybe they used it to kill Bin Ladens double.but if the software was THAT GOOD they should have known Bin Laden killed by Omar Sheik. How do I know this. Al Jazeera article with Benazhir Bhutto. Month later she was assasinated. I bought pltr at 9 sold at 29 find it hard to invest in big brother,2,0,1615253250,teenybluerobot

13,gqa8cn3,"hmm tricky question since I am from NY and lived through it..Maybe I would. but the t3rrorists were already giving off red flags and noone did anything. Ultimately, the FBI and CIA had the info and did nothing. If Palantir gave the info to the FBI and CIA would they still do nothing? Because in the end. There still needs to be enforcement/execution of plan/prevention/enforcement. Remember we trained Bin Laden...Its very HOMELAND irl....It is just software. The military/CIA?FBI needs to act upon it And for 9-11 they didnt do shit",1,0,1615256449,teenybluerobot

23,gqalhws,How exactly do their algos predict behaviors? I've watched a few videos from their demo days and unless I'm misinterpreting them that's not what they do.

What you see is one thing in demos. The company is real life minority report. Elon Musk has some really interesting perspectives about this, because it is basically AI. (referring to the dangers of AI being evil or used for evil purposes) Remember, the queries that go in are interpreted by software written by humans. And that engineer's code determines the level of morality of human vs AI... Some people think it is great I find it scary as fuck. And the fact that they did NOT find BIN LADEN leads me to believe it isnt really that great......If you have any questions regardirng Bin Laden, pls research Benazir Bhutto and how it was Omar Sheik that killed Bin Laden. Which further convinces me we are in a big psyop... But it takes a shit ton of critical thinking to evaluate it all. And few are okay with questioning everything. But I will leave you with one bit to look at. 
If you know anything about kidney failure and Bin laden was in END STAGE kidney failure in 01 you know that you cabbot live without dialysis 3-4 times a week.
The compound where (body double) was killed had no dialysis machines in it and NOWHERE near any place to get dialysis 3-4x a week.
You cannot live for more than a week or so off dialysis because you will die from the buildup in your blood. Start there in your research. Because THIS is WHAT PLTR touts as their big victory.
Iran knew it was a body double and Bin Laden was killed by Omar Sheik.
It is a really crazy rabbit hole. Put it together.
