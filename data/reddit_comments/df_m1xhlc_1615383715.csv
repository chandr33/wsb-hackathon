7,gqfzzdt,"So it's and 830 and the market opens up in an hour. But IKEA opens up at 10. Ive been staying here for about a month after my mom's boyfriend left me. I've been trying to get out but I just can't. Its a fucking maze in here. I always end up at the entrance and its impossible. Every window is fake so I haven't seen sunlight in forever. But last night I slept on one of the displays. Toilets didn't work too well. But I ate some leftover salmon from the trash. I don't get how people can waste such delicious food. Saw someone looking at the BRIMINES bed frame when they should be looking at the MALM one. Its just looks so much better. Hopefully I can find my way out today. I'll keep you guys updated on that task. Hopefully my mom will recognize me because I haven't shaved, showered, or changed in a month. But something I did do for a month was hold GME because I simply like the stock. GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",0,0,1615383719,Shadyniqqa
