I don't think the majority of holders at this point are getting off what is clearly an upward rocket ride. Most traders have been waiting for years for an opportunity like this. I don't see major selloff until the *at least* the mid to upper 300s. Now, because of what happened at the 450 peak last time, I do believe a portion of people will take profit at that time (probably just BEFORE it hits that peak so they can get out before it tanks), but I also believe a lot of holders will not sell off because actually the stock probably wouldn't have tanked last time if it weren't for what RH did. I'm going to stay in for that reason.",1,0,1615385254,CityOfZion
