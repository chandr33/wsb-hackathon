24,gqj5sgb,"I‚Äôm about to drop some straight autism here. 

So there are 9,500,000 degenerates on WSB. Assume 30% are hardcore participants. That leaves 2,850,000. Assume 75% of them is in the target demographic that would receive the stimmy and use it for stocks. Assume 80% of them will go all in on GME. That is 1,710,000 people times $1400, meaning we have $2,394,000,000 buying power. Assume it only takes 30k shares to move the price $1. At current price of $250, we can find out how many shares we can move at that rate. $2,394,000,000/250=9,576,000 shares. 9,576,000/30,000=$319.20 additional dollars to the current share price of $250 for a total of $569.2. This is not including long institutions or additional yolos and hedging by market makers. The stimulus check alone is sufficient to drive enough energy to trigger MOASS. We also still have the possibility of any remaining open shorts around the top of the first squeeze ranging around the $400-$500 range. 
I will just leave this here.

The problem is MMs and the media has shown that they will do everything they can to scare people away in order to get people to sell by manipulating the market. And the SEC is sitting over there with fingers in their ears while they 'investigate' DFV(God)

IMO what happened today was just the start. These 3 entities will do everything to stay rich and in control. 

AOC, Maxine Waters, Biden and everyone else you think cares about us apes, don't. If GME tanks and doesn't peak to where it should be, that is more money in the pockets of the already wealthy. 

The next time it drops 500 to 150, you bet your ass that Andy paper hands who bought at 350 the 1st time will sell and walk away. Those people who bought in at 10/30/50 will still make tons of cash in the coming years off of the Cohen Game Stop.
