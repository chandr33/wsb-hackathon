Now why don't you and I sell our GME (for a hefty profit), and go buy RKT together! Remember how primates are stronger when we do things together! So get some of your friends to sell GME and buy RKT with us!

18,gpm1ktg,"One thing I want to say (not bot, check history) is that you shouldn‚Äôt miss out on some potential elsewhere by keeping the blinkers on. 

I feel like GME and AMC is becoming a legitimate cult at this point - like you cannot partake in any other aspects of the markets, otherwise it‚Äôs a betrayal. Hell it‚Äôs even spread to the comments in peoples streams if they dare look at or weigh up buying in elsewhere. I get it, especially for those who invested GME 200$+, or 12$+ AMC - it‚Äôs kinda cathartic to mentally go ‚Äúall in‚Äù on these two, especially if you‚Äôre desperate for some squeeze to 500+, as am I. Wish fulfilment, I guess. 

But tl;dr don‚Äôt miss out on gains elsewhere. Both SOS and RKT were apparently ‚Äúshill distractions‚Äù, yet RKT yesterday (in 25-30$ a share, out 40), and SOS today (in 7$ a share, out 9.10), were the big winners for me (by my limited capital standards anyway).",1,0,1614827169,RifleEyez

If you were in on RKT, you should have planned to sell at a reasonable profit point. $40 was actually my desired goal. Double my money works for me.

58,gpn51od,"Pretty sure what we're seeing now is ""consensus cracking"", essentially just trying to sow discord by encouraging factionalism.

If you're trying to break up a group you don't like, you don't just hamfist information down the throats of your targets. They already don't trust you, that isn't going away. Make them distrust each other. Isolate, redirect, neutralize.

Breaking down social bonds will freeze a target. When they're suspicious of others, you amplify suspicious or just obnoxious behavior by the ""true believers"". Some of them are people, others are working with the bad guys. Ever notice how ""conspiracy theorists"" are incredibly ineffective despite being pretty common? Remember how occupy wall street fell apart because identity politics started being mentioned everywhere at the same time?

Bonus points for throwing something to the plebs that they'll actually benefit from.

The point consensus cracking is to isolate you so you'll lash out at the closest target. The closest target is always other people in your group.
