4,gqgcada,It doesn‚Äôt seem like they are using  a lot of borrowed shares compared to last time. They took a ton off the market today which leads me to believe they might be saving them for a heavy short. Maybe their trying to cause a drastic drop in price to get an avalanche going caused buy paper hands getting into it the last few days. Maybe it‚Äôs just the retail investors and whales kicking ass.... I‚Äôm just paranoid since there‚Äôs no way we know for sure and can‚Äôt trust any real data. I‚Äôve seen 3-4 different #s for short % being used in so many media articles. Either way HOLD,1,0,1615389698,Brewermcbrewface
