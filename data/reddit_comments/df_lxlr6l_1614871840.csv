0,gpnu342,"I posted a (too?) lengthy DD on GM a few weeks ago.  It was after the initial GME run and shortly after the mod-reverse coup.  It conformed to the rules as far as I understand them, but I'm only 5 months post cake day and karma is in the 700 range.  OK to try again or are there other rules not mentioned above or in the rules to the right that we need to be aware of?",2,0,1614871864,One_Eyed_Man_King
