10,gpl0ooi,"What is there to discuss? It's not another GME, so its not 'mooning any time now'. Even if 'the short squeeze didnt happen yet' for GME, AMC is not even close to being similar in terms of % short shares and retail investors don't make up a big enough % of share ownership for a collective reddit effort to make much of a difference to prices. Besides that, what is there to talk about? There's no company news. No national news related to AMC (e.g. surprise covid news). No dividends or earnings coming soon. 

It was part of daily discussion in January ago when BB, AMC, GME and NOK were all flying around all over the place. Since then BB is down 40%, AMC is down 50%, GME is down 50%+,  NOK is down 20%+.  All the 'meme stocks' have plummeted compared to their January hype. NOK and BB are considered safe-ish long term plays,  and everyone already knows cinema chains will see gains later in the year when chains reopen.",-6,0,1614808386,C9_Lemonparty

18,gpl2t6k,"AMC‚Äôs earnings call is next Wednesday. They will most likely miss but the real key isn‚Äôt their earnings (everyone knows they will be shit) it‚Äôs what management has to say about the future. They also managed to raise close to $1 billion in cash by selling stock directly into the market. So they are sitting on close to $1 billion of cash that has no borrowing costs associated with it. They are also negotiating with their landlords to reduce rental costs now and into the future. On top of that, the board recently approved millions of dollars worth of bonus payouts. 

For a company that was on the verge of bankruptcy a few months ago, million dollar bonuses are only happening if management has a clear path out of the shit storm.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going anywhere past $20 but I do think it could go above $10 if Management has a good plan to get the company back on solid ground.",10,0,1614809332,McPowPow

If not, them unpurchased shares after 72 hours (today after hours) are considered Failure to Deliver. Unless I'm missing something? I'm not saying the calls expire today. I'm saying today is the last day to make good on expired calls from Friday. Sorry for the miswording",6,0,1614812345,Ciricath
