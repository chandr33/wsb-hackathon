30,gqdlv42,"I tried to post something like this but alas i couldn't. I wasn't arguing the impact on the global economy like you are but the sheer lack of funds to produce the price per share target many are saying. I believe it's physically impossible to reach 7 digits. If we are going after the hedge funds, granted bankrupting them, they still have a limit of what they can pay out. In fact, i sometimes fear that they declare bankruptcy and avoid paying out in full anyway. 

Its simple math as well, the short side has a total of $x in capital. They owe y number of shares. We're aiming for z per share target. If z times y is greater than x. All apes don't get their bananas. Z times Y has to equal X or X-1 for all apes to get their bananas.

Not to mention the number of shares institutions own, that isn't necessary in on the ape rocket. Which i checked, those numbers were some how above 100% and there was insider owned stocks as well. Didn't understand how that was possible but again can't create post to bring this up to ask about it.

I wasn't even preaching a sell idea either, just suggesting some of these targets seem wildly unrealistic. I own 20 shares and promised to tattoo a yellow diamond on my left hand if i make $50k+ which would be a $2,500 target.  I'm not making the bet, just wanted to say if i diamond held to that point, it's what I'm going to do.",2,0,1615326443,Psypho_Diaz
