39,gqi2f4l,"Fellow apes, I've seen so much misinformation regarding the SSR or Short Sale Restriction rule, so I RTFM and gained a small wrinkle on my smooth brain of polished glass.  Now I don't know shit about dick, but I did just read [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp) while taking a dump at a holiday inn express.  What the rule says is you can't short on a downtick, so then what's a downtick?  A downtick is when the last transaction on a stock was for a price less than the transaction before it.  

Now for the smooth brain explanation, consider the following order flow:

$1.00  
$1.01  &lt;- You can short here, it ticked UP  
$1.00  &lt;- You cannot short here, it ticked DOWN   
$1.01 &lt;- You can short here now, it ticked UP

It does not mean at all that short selling is banned for an entire day.  The more you know.",16,0,1615414969,derprondo
