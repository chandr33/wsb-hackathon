2,gpowwqe,"I thought that way too. Then I sold my company and tried to retire at age 39 and got so bored. Once you have that money you'll want to do something with your life. It's not health to just get fat and watch TV. And, fuck me is it boring. Keep in mind not everyone of your friend can pick up and fly to X so if you want to do shit with people you have to pay or schedule around them. And paying for others gets old and they begin to resent you. Trust me when I say: if you have enough to live, you'll need something like stock to keep you sane. It's like a casino that you can play from home and the government doesn't ban.",2,0,1614888331,KnoxHarringtonVideos

After that, same-day shipping for groceries. Think how nuts that's going to be.

I don't know guys, I may be just a weirdo. I keep very fit, I have a home gym, I certainly don't look like a hermit or a recluse - but at the end of the day, I prefer the company of myself and no one else (until I am ready to have a serious family).
