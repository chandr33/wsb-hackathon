4,gqh8xyg," OP:

I get it. Really, I do. The price took a big dump and hit some stops on the way down, adding to the dip. People will be upset, and some bad posts are inevitable which will undoubtedly need removing. But every single post on the first handful of ""New"" pages?

This may be something regularly done on this sub whenever prices really start to move, or when content is posted at an increased rate, so I may be referring to something not out of the norm. It just strikes me a really weird when some posts seem decent from the preview, yet they are also getting removed. Only ones I've seen not removed are very blatant memes.

Am I the only one that is just a bit weirded out by this? Or can someone let me know if this is a normal thing? I don't normally browse through the ""New"" section, so I honestly have no idea, tbh.",1,0,1615402275,PhattyOgre
