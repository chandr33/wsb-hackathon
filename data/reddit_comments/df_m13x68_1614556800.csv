18,gqbk42r,"Dead cat. So essentially still going to trend lower. Best time to load up long puts with any rally. 

Some folks are calling for a rebound in tech and essentially a MOAR (mother of all rallies) for equities into May/June. SPX to 4.5k, NQ to 15k, Do you see that?",1,0,1615293186,nerfcharmap
19,gqbkdbv,"NQ 15k not possible anymore. NQ valuation can at best stay stale, it's not going up until the next dovish cycle. meaning NQ stocks would need to growh thanks to their own earnings, and growing via earnings is a lot less exciting and efficient then just pumping valuation.",1,0,1615293362,GreedySpeculator
20,gqblbg6,"Great post. The expansionary effect of an infra bill is something that will take a while to work through the system. Also, rate hikes after an economic shock aren't easy to put in place. It took a lot longer for FF rate to increase after the 2008 crash than anticipated and a lot of bank ebitdas bled in the meanwhile. 

I feel long QQQ is something that can keep going for a while as soon as we get the rate jitters out of our way. Also GLD and the commodity trade",1,0,1615293992,thalassamikra

Traditionally tech is supposed to outperform in every rate scenario short of a bull steepening. This has been a very strange one where tech instead sold off while financials and energy rallied bigly.

I'm not sure what to make of it and I'm just trying understand this a little bit better. 

OG is saying rotation is ongoing and any rebound can be sold into. Others I've seen have said the opposite, that this is the beginning of the 5th wave and we're getting an exponential rally and after which the fed will have to step in and hike rates and we'll get a huge recession again.
