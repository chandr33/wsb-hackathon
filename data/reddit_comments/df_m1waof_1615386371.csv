The hedge funds' short positions aren't borrowed from retail investors, they are borrowed from institutional investors whose long positions are well above that $250,000 SIPC limit.  If the shorts go bankrupt, **most of those shorts will be written off instead of being covered**.  Institutional investor accounts will be zeroed out because the shares they loaned out no longer exist.  Long story short, the short squeeze will be aborted/canceled.

Your GME shares will be safe, sitting in a cash account.  If you are lucky, you might be able to sell them during this process.  If you are unlucky, you will lose access to your GME shares for months and won't be able to sell until the whole ordeal has been dealt with.",1,0,1615386628,taedrin

Stars in their eyes they make gain fables out of the tea leaves and shifting sands. Nobody has any idea what is going on. Nobody has any idea when or where this is going or when or where it stops. It could certainly hit 1000. I have to tell you though, I don’t think every institutional investor in GME is going to pass up the chance to claim they got a 100% increase last quarter and I don’t think every short has been too greedy to start covering. When half, or a quarter or 10% of your shares becomes enough money to be life changing, then just take the damn life change. Keep whatever percentage you want in, but take some profits. GME might be the most legitimate long play, if they can pull it off.  I can guarantee you that DFV isn’t risking his entire life on GME hitting 1000.

42,gqg7hu0,"&gt;Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future.

I think this will be a slow climb this time, for whatever reason. No DD, but this thing has just been slowly building and especially after the DTCC news. I think the slow climb is to sort of reinforce the raise in the price, filling the buy side with more points that would be more difficult to offset with shorts and to give people confidence necessary to HODL and keep the float low.

It just feels like this is meant to be a slow moving juggernaut which says to me there's no force rushing this thing along to new highs. Like it can just inevitably build and there's not much anyone can do for it.",1,0,1615387565,crossdl

49,gqg85p7,"It never hit 1.5B a share, stop chatting absolute shit when you don’t know what you’re on about.

From the article you literally just fucking linked.


“In April this year [2017] DryShips, which is registered in the Marshall Islands, struck a deal with a BVI firm, Kalani Investments, whereby Dryships would sell up to $226m worth of stock to the BVI entity over a two year period.

The deal sees Kalani getting the DryShips stock at a discount and they quickly dump the newly-issued equity on the US market. The flood of stock depresses the share price, which falls below $1 — risking suspension under Nasdaq rules. So, once a month for the past four months, DryShips has enacted share consolidations — most recently at 1-for-7 — to get the price back above a dollar.

It’s these repeated consolidations which throw up the comic historic share price high of $1.483bn when the chart is reset.”",1,0,1615387865,Hardstucked
