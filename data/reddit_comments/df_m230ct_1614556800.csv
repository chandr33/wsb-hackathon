1,gqgvmyw,"Both are good stocks, dont get me wrong. One has a higher potential to earn money at this very moment though. I sold my 50 amc this morning and got two more shares of GME. When the squeeze has been squozen I will put some tendies back in AMC.",1,0,1615397429,NinjaRage83
2,gqgwpw3,"Agree I have 20 stocks in AMC...

Though I gotta guess we are going to repeat the roller-coaster dip... 

so if AMC hits 5 to 6... buy more.

If GME hits 60 to 50... buy more.",3,0,1615397781,Mouth_of_Maggots
