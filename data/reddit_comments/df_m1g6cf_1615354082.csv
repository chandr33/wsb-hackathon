*[First off, our fav topic here: short interest. Right now, ASO is the 3rd most heavily shorted company behind gme and skt. ](https://i.imgur.com/rPnENyg.jpg)

*[It also has massive institutional ownership. Over 90% of float is held by institutions. This is a great bullish endorsement of the company itself, but also shows large buyers are ready to move if the timing makes sense. ](https://i.imgur.com/vPgK4Cx.jpg)

*[The company, which IPO'd late last year, absolutely CRUSHED earnings in the middle of covid. With guns and ammo being one of their main categories, you can expect their upcoming earnings report to beat in a big way. ](https://i.imgur.com/iTSSzzh.jpg)
