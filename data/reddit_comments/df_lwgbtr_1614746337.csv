13,gpi2lf7,"It‚Äôs entirely about RKT acting in their own interests and has nothing to do with GME. They want to shake loose and punish the shorts while driving their stock value back up to make up for the damage they took shortly after their IPO. There are clear signs that they started planning this move months before GME initially took off. They announced the buyback in November, and their Q4 earnings report and conference was clearly scheduled way ahead of time, as was the decision to announce the special dividend during the press conference. GME‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond run‚Äù just happened to start on 2/25, the same day as the RKT press conference.

39,gpi55z2,I 100% agree. Looking at the sentiment it's pretty easy to see there are a lot of younger and probably misinformed people jumping on the wagon. They want their $500 investments to turn into $50k because it's all they can afford. I got caught up in the euphoria during phase 1 and lost $50k in unrealized gains like a dumbass and I just as easily see this going tits up while people scream conspiracy and shill on other tickers.

As for RKT, I think it's because there was an opportunity to pick up some cheap calls on an undervalued, profitable company with a compelling story and a similar large short interest.
