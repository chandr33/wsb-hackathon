78,gqh61p4,"Short answer: It's more than possible.  


DTCC has vast insurance, these hedge funds are allowed, essentially, to make a bet that has potentially infinite loss. It's the SEC's job to mandate this, but they're asleep at the wheel and overmatched by litigation that has allowed this nonsense to sustain itself for many years.  


They drove this truck into a power junction everyday for years destroying companies whilst only swallowing that tiny, pesky, risky idea that ""infinite loss"" would never happen.  


Now it's gonna happen and after, the world will change but right now, this minute, there's nothing stopping it but those who can imagine it and are willing to fight for it.  


There's a bunch of apes on this truck, and the powerhouse is going to be ours, to power whatever we want for years, because they just \*presumed\* nobody would be daring enough to go their unmanned station and take it over because while it was churning out money, they cut back on people to watch over it. We're gonna turn the power off in their houses.  


DTCC is a trillion dollar business, with a 70 trillion dollar insurance policy, these hedge funds altogether have probably 200 billion, this goes into their owners personal assets as well, and hedge funds even with conservative shorting positions will be vacuum sucked at an extreme loss, because they got greedy at the end of the last run, and while they took seemingly safe modest positions at the height, those are going to hurt the most when it gets to 600, 800, 1000.  


Meanwhile rival HF's are seeing our stability, that we've created, and that's called ""Consumer investment"". It means as long as we're here, and holding the base, they will play counter games, they will drop whale attacks, they will pump and dump KNOWING that it'll shake off some paper hands, but in the end, there's only 70 million shares, and half of those are owned by institutions who CAN'T pull out their shares to make a profit.  


If we hold the rest, that's a perfectly safe ground for them to ride this stock up, down, around, up, down, around, squeezing reliable money out of it - all the while turning it into a battleground more appetizing than ever seen before.  


We've turned the market upside down and as long as we hold, we won't just launch a rocket - we'll fall into the sky like it's the natural order.

So yes.  


I think it's going to happen.   


IF

79,gqh6mpp,"Fidelity and Schwab don't use Apex Clearing. During the last gamme squeeze in Jan they didn't restrict buy orders because they have their own clearing houses.  


Meanwhile Fidelity owns vast stakes in GME, so does Schwab, so it's in their best interest to let people buy buy buy, and their cash reserves are gigantic - and it's like handing money to themselves. They can't pull out their stock, but having it skyrocket will pay them out come earning time.
