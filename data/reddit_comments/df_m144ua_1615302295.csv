6,gqc182n,"A helpful answer would be appreciated. I'm fucking done with big funds, I put nearly 200k of GME gains on the original run in some supposed 5 star funds that have been absolute dog shit the last month, heavy tech obviously. Fuck that, I can lose my own money.

Question is I submitted them for selling yesterday and it usually takes about 48 hrs to go through so will they sell at today's prices which would obviously work out in my favour?
