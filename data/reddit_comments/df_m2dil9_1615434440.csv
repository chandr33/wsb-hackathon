10,gqj3qhn,That's what these MM do! I could have made a nice chunk of change last Friday when GME hit 150 but God forbid it kept going. All of a sudden it sold off. Who do you think did that? They do it all the time. Needless to say not just GME either. Look at PLTR as an example. No way it should be pinned at or below $25 Anytime it breaks thay like today when it climbed to $26 immediately slapped down and hit with what always seems to be a 30-50 minute sell-off where it looses around $1. Where's Cramer now with all that we need government and SEC talk. I hope GME blasts off even more and fuck them over.,1,0,1615434490,vjbk1

42,gqj41zi,"I think I can explain that too. To be clear, I‚Äôm not a tech side guy. But I post articles to a website every day. 

On our site, most sites, there are two components to a URL. A numerical ID, and a slug pulled from the words in the headline. We can change the slug, to accompany a change to the headline, post publication. But it continues to be recognized as the same URL, eg for analytics, by Google because it has the same numerical ID. 

So I can publish a story tonight whose URL is /GME-what-do-tomorrow. Tomorrow at noon if the stock crashes, I can edit the headline to ‚ÄúGME crashes at noon‚Äù and update the slug to /GME-crashes-at-noon and Google would still record the article as having been published tonight. Leading to this exact confusion. 

In fact, if you look at an analytics panel for a website you‚Äôll see that social media sites add a bunch of tags and tracking data to URLs, creating a gajillion new URLs. But so long as they all have the same numerical ID, they all register as the same URL even though they‚Äôre markedly different. 

Now with MarketWatch, I assume this is all automated and run by algorithms. So at some point the hed and slug was updated, on an article published shortly before midnight the night before. 

That‚Äôs actually super common. If a media outlet anticipates a big news story in the morning, they may lay out a shell for their story late the night before, to save time in the morning. 

As someone who works in media, none of this is even surprising. Let alone suspicious.",3,0,1615434699,EthanCoxMTL
