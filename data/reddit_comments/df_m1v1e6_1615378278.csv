39,gqfroru,"I originally had 200 shares that I bought in early January for $18. This was after losing $30k in 2020 and I swore to only fuck with shares from then on. Got way wrapped up in the squeeze hype and forgot all about how depressed I had been and started looking at how much a nice Mustang would cost. Then shit peaked and started drilling and I convinced myself it wasn‚Äôt over. Then it got down below my breakeven point from 2020 (with taxes) and I finally sold. Still had $37k so I was moderately happy. Then I had a few really successful day trading sessions and got cocky. Then I blew it all. With my last $5k I bought some GME calls Monday and I‚Äôm very cautiously watching the price action - might cash out today and be happy with my $15k.
