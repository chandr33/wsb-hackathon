Lol hedge funds don't hold 401ks or Retirements. Most Hedge Funds have strict requirements of millions of dollars invested.

Hedge Funds getting fucked isn't going to hurt any retirement type stuff unless you are either very rich already.

Regardless, even if this does fuck over some boomers good. After years of being told about safe investing and all that crap it would be nice to see them feel some of that burn that we all feel every week trading.

They can sell when the price is appropriate for their shareholders. They're prepared for another round, and GME isn't worth $1,000 a share long term. I'd argue it's not even worth $30 long term, but that kind of talk is blasphemy around here.",1,0,1615389892,Nooberling
