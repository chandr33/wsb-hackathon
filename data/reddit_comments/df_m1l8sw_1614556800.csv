10,gqeeuhn,"I can relate, but in a different way.  My family has been very fortunate during Covid.  Everyone is healthy, our financial situation is better than ever, but a big part of my job is travel and that was completely shut down for the past year.  

For the most part I am working from home.  My wife's office went to 100% work from home.  My workload went to almost nothing, and even though the paycheck was still there the satisfaction of accomplishing goals was gone.  I'd sleep in until 9 am, roll out of bed and walk to my office.  Since winter hit it's been hard to even get outside and get a little exercise.  Just sitting in a damn office chair all day.  Compared to others we had it great, but it was really getting to me.

I started off on Reddit looking at subs for something to pass the time, then I heard about GME.  I've had some investments for a while, but it was boring shit through a broker.  GME actually felt...fun!  I bought in, lost my ass, bought in again, broke even, and this time I'm actually making money.  I've been so amped up for something that feels like it has a purpose that I usually wake up around 3 am just to watch the market.  Today, when my entire portfolio turned green (minus boomer stocks, but they move like turtles anyway) it was about as much fun as I've had in a year.  

Thanks retards, without knowing it you've given me purpose again.",4,0,1615341165,chiefoogabooga
