13,gpo2lx7,"can someone explain this retard what's going on here

basically you bought 2 contracts at $0.69 ea x 100 = 2 x 69 = 138 for both contracts at strike $104. on 25th strike is struck, so you can execute the call? the top on 26th was $108 so that's $4 profit per share * 100 = $400 per contract - £69 premium = $331 x 2 contracts = $662 profit. and this is where i get lost - where did that $4895 and £1700 call sell came from then? 

sorry this ape much retard. never played with options just know the basic theory behind it, or so i thought.",2,0,1614875586,ChiefRedEye
