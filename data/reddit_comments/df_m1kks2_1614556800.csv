63,gqeoh24,"I don't know how many shares you have nor should you feel the need to tell us but:

If, for example, you have just one share, my strategy in that position would be might as well wait out for the price to peak and start dropping down then sell. Here on /r/wsb a lot of people (seem to) believe 100k is a possibility, and if it peaks there and you sell one share for 75k, that's still a lot of money. Maybe not completely life changing, but definitely life improving, right?

Anyway, the very tricky part to this strategy is guessing where that peak is as the price rockets. It could hit 10k then drop quickly towards 8k. Are you going to sell at 7.5k, and then watch as the price climbs to 15k, 20k?

Even as the price is rising quite dramatically right now, none of us even know if it will reach 100k, or even 10k, or even 1k to be honest. Even if I personally say I believe 1k will definitely happen, you need to make up your own mind.",2,0,1615346427,chuhrros

78,gqerl0i,"I see. Since you're saying 30 shares won't be life-changing, you're definitely one of the most grounded people in this subreddit then, at least as far as what people are openly commenting goes.

The most popular price target currently on this subreddit is 100k, including the very top comment in response to your post here. That would yield you 3 million (or 1 million for your diamond hands batch, which is still life-changing I'm guessing?), but I'm guessing you're obviously in the boat of hoping this would happen, but you don't believe at all that it could happen.

Anyway, it looks like you already have an exit strategy ready and it's similar to my own: selling in batches and definitely leaving a considerable number to diamond hand to potentially astronomical figures. I'd bet many many others around here employ the same strategy even if they rightfully don't talk about it openly.",1,0,1615348228,chuhrros
