48,gqa9vkt,"&gt;If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

If the brokerages are overleveraged and are self-financed, wouldn't they avoid a margin call on themselves? or is there a limit imposed by the SEC where, regardless of the funding source, you either have to show proof of the ability to pay?",1,0,1615257277,PDubsinTF

70,gqabadl,"Buyer and seller still have to agree on price or the shares don't change hands. Buyers were trying to buy at 200 (for example) and there were no sellers at that price. But the buyers weren't offering more, and the sellers weren't willing to sell at 200. 

In a perfect market with instant decision making and knowledge, the price moves perfectly to the balance between supply and demand. In the real world it's not that smooth, people and institutions have buy and sell limits, and nothing works quite perfectly.

If the shorts get called back or people start getting margin called, they'll be forced to buy even at a higher price and you'll see the price climb up",20,0,1615258060,UncleFumbleBuck
