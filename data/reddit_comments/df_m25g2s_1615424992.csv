1,gqim40a,"One of the biggest mistakes they make is in assuming that everyone on redit is some version of the ""gamer in their basement"" stereotype, with no education, and totally brainless. They neglect that those people invented all the tech they are using, and that lots of them lurk in forums like this. Hedge funds provide literally no value. In their absence, the market still works fine, or another appears to take their place. Nobody notices because they don't actually create anything.

Lots of people here are not poor, not stupid, not uneducated, and not irrational. We act like it, cause it's fun to let loose and ape around. But we have our shit together. We do our DD. We can count to at least 1000.

So their ignorance of reality and arrogance is becoming their downfall. They are literally repeating the exact same script that got them in trouble a month ago. I mean, and they call us dumb money?",4,0,1615425075,DilbertedOttawa

I‚Äôm trying to argue no one is forcing you to make 4 round trip $12 buys to lose money.

No where did I say laws don‚Äôt force people to do things.  

Maybe this is easier for you: 

law says you eat 3 crayons you cannot eat a fourth or you don‚Äôt get to eat crayons the next day.  You eat 4 crayons and cry bcuz sad bcuusase poor

No one is forcing you to eat that fourth crayon. Not the law, not anything but your smooth brain
