2,gpfvykh,"This is actually a result of Cares Act. There are clauses in there (never mentioned) that allowed this to happen and other provisions to remove toxic assets from the banks balance sheet to the Federal Reserve. I am not really sure but one of the financial journalist actually wrote about this, but it did not get the views. 

After the Revlon fiasco, Citigroup is actually insolvent. Goldman Sachs is pushing their retail Marcus for this very reason. I always wondered why Goldman wanted to expand into the retail business, never made sense. There are thousands of other business lines they could expand too. Now I know why.",1,0,1614709151,blue_sparrow_zero

12,gpkghhl,"FT “History has shown us that whenever these sorts of programmes are introduced, they tend to last longer than what the Fed expects,” said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson, noting it took longer than expected for the Fed to begin unwinding its crisis-era quantitative easing programmes.

Earlier on Tuesday, banks gobbled up $82bn in temporary liquidity from the Fed in the form of overnight and two-week repo loans. Bids for the two-week funding were $43.2bn for the $35bn on offer. A similar operation on January 7 was [oversubscribed](https://archive.is/o/qSEVu/https://www.ft.com/content/9fb896d4-32fa-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2) by roughly the same amount, while another two days later was close to fully subscribed.""
