These people all have connections and will fall upwards as usual. And thirdly stop buying into this we're the avengers crap man, you're gonna be left holding a bag.

25,gqicyyu,"The joke on which *this entire sub* is founded is that the wives/girlfriends of the redditors here routinely cheat on them with richer boyfriends due to their poverty.  The reason it's so widespread is because it's, y'know, relatable.

The point you're making sounds nice and wholesome, but it's got some real poison at its center.  Poor people don't have happier or more grounded relationships than wealthy people.  The rich aren't any more adulterous than the destitute.  People are just people, no matter what the numbers in their bank account say, or their skin color, or what neighborhood they're from.

We're in this fight against the hedgehogs together, but that doesn't make us virtuous.  Stay grounded.  Keep your wits.",2,0,1615420204,PerendiaEshte
