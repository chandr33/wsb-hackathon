36,gqbshe3,"DFV is like Rosa Parks.

Hear me out, the hedge funds wanted DFV and GME to sit in the back of the bus with a bumpy ride. But DFV stood up and said, GME has Ryan Cohen, e-commerce, booming gaming industry, and it's a DEEP FUCKING VALUE. So like Rosa parks he walked GME straight to the front of the bus where every stock moons.

GME was loving the front but the idiot hedgies got mad and said GET TO THE BACK, and tried to force us back with short sells. Retards didn't like this. The word spread to wsb retards and we were pissed, all the retards and DFV said we like the stock and bought, and didn't sell. We weren't riding the bus, we weren't playing the game. By not riding we hurt them significantly and force change!There's a new rule around failure to delivers because of us and DFV! Brokers were caught manipulating the time they need to deliver shares by selling and rebuying. Now retards here can sit anywhere on the short bus

DFV rallied us around Gamestop just like Rosa parks rallied people against the bus operators. We both caused financial pain to create change.  This could be a good movie especially if GME were to do really well in the next few years",1,0,1615298185,Long_term_Andy
