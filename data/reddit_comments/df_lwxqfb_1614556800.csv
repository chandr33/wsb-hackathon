2,gpjrnpk,"One concern I have about all airlines is trying to factor business travel ( a significant portion of travel).  For my job, anecdotally, I don’t see myself traveling anywhere near the extent that I used to. I imagine other places of employment are also making similar decisions. In the end, it helps companies bottom line to travel less and virtually teleport in instead (whenever possible). Now there are still situations where face to face will be required. But everything else, it doesn’t make sense to spend money on travel (flight, hotel, daily expenses) if we have become accustomed to zoom meetings. 

These are just my thoughts...",10,0,1614788994,death_by_paper_cut

5,gpjrv09,"Agreed. But I think in the future flying across the US or another country will be like taking the metro to work. Back in the early days of old no one thought of riding their horse 30 miles to work but people drive all the time. Soon you’ll take a flight both ways in one day for an 8 hour work day and it’ll be normal

9,gpjtplq,"Just saying I like UAL and DAL, UAL had a price of over $90 before the shitstorm, now has been climbing steadily since mid 2020 and is at $55. AAL is probably the weakest of the big three airlines in the US imo, extending their reach. On the other hand, they are investing in some new aircraft and fleet upgrades, which is good.",1,0,1614789865,yoloinvestin

19,gpjxvhx,"It’s because they’re debt ridden you idiot. They sold their miles to credit cards for liquidity and probably will offer more shares to raise more capital. If you want to play airlines, look at domestic cash heavy airlines like Alaska airlines or southwest. It’s the better plays.",2,0,1614791630,whoa1ndo
