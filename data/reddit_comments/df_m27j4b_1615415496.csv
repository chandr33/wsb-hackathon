53,gqige6x,"Your description of what happens or what what happened during the flash crash is not accurate..

The algos do not sell against each other and drive the prices down...

What happened in 2010 and what happens during a flash crash is that the algos detect an issue or an irregularity and cancel all open orders and go dark.

Since HFT is continuously the main source of liquidity, when they stop sending orders and cancel opens orders liquidity plummets and the ""book"" loses it's ""depth"" and then stop orders begin to execute which helps drive the price down.
