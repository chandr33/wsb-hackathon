8,gqdah6k,"Ape here with a theory so that I can in turn hear your theory:

My theory: 
There are two computers in Soviet Russia. Both has a gravity bird tapping the Enter button on the machine's keyboard. On one of the computers the enter button triggers a sell order. On the other it triggers a buy order. 

Because the computers in soviet Russia are old, it takes several minutes for this to process. 

Sometimes, before the birds can clink down and hit the enter key, one of the free roaming dogs from Soviet Russia wanders in and walks on the keyboard. Generally this results in the page being refreshed and of no consequence, but at times the dogs manage to delete the 25 and enter in a new number. As 2 is the most common amount of dollars that one has in Soviet Russia, this key is the biggest resulting in consistent numbers starting with 2. 

Earlier today, one of these roaming dogs hit an extra three digits before wandering away, which resulted in the GME jump from $227--&gt;$237. The dog has since had a statue erected, and Soviet russia sold most of Siberia to the dogs to produce the capital for the transaction.

This is where Siberian huskies come from.",13,0,1615321426,Acejr50
