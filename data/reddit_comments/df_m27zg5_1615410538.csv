88,gqhsmky,"I wrote this last month. This is pretty much psychological warfare. They tank the price to scare weak bulls into selling. They take off the selling pressure and let the price rise, making the weak bulls who didn't sell already think they've got another chance to exit. Strong bulls, on the other hands, kept hitting the buy button.

Of course, the thing you have to think about (i'm talking to the weak bulls here), if they could get the price to $60, 50, 40, 20, or 4 that's what the price would be. But after that short attack today, we 6% up since yesterday. That's just a fact.
