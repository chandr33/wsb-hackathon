The M2Velocity is also showing that people aren't buying things with their savings accounts, so all this stimulus money is just keeping people afloat right now. That M2V is also showing historical lows, meaning we're in a dollar shortage, not a surplus like everyone likes to believe.

Additionally, consumer loan growth is in the shitter right now. If you want inflation, you want people to be spending and loaning massively.

76,gq659g6,"You and I disagree. I lived the 2002 and 2009 crude spikes. The trillions of dollars between the Fed and Treasury pumped into the markets in the past 12 months have exponentially increased the M1 money supply and the velocity of money. It‚Äôs dramatic and historic from a money supply perspective.

The inflationary pressure will do two things - drive crude to historic highs and help the US inflate ourselves out of debt. This is not by accident.

High oil makes a green transition more palatable to the consumer and it ensures that legacy energy companies have the cash to remain relevant as they generate huge cash returns over the next few years. In other words, Exxon will be the green energy leader and will buy out the ‚Äúwinners‚Äù. This saves jobs and large American companies.

Secondly a 3% inflation rate compounded over the next 20 years is a defacto national debt reduction of 65% when we borrowed the money at sub 1%.

OPEC+ has taken a lot of production off the table...and it can bring it back. US production is unlikely to increase drastically, but it's only 2.5 mbpd below pre-pandemic highs. 

The headwinds have not disappeared. Oil stocks are becoming more and more unattractive as investments. The impacts on demand from economies turning away from carbon-based forms of energy is tough to predict. Geopolitics -- like an Iran deal -- will move the markets. Etc. 

In short, a 2023 seems less certain than a Jan 22. Personally, I've sold off a number of XOM calls bought last October/November and hedged the rest.
