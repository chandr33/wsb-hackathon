12,gqh20zx,"I'm on Wealthsimple in Canada.  They're 15 minutes behind too but you get current actual market price buying or selling.  If it's the same for Fidelity, it'll state in somewhere in the TOS.  Wealthsimple let's you know when you sign up for an account.  I've always got the ticker open in another window to see what the real time price is if I'm buying or selling.  Not ideal, but it works for me.  It's our only commission free option here.",1,0,1615399570,METAL4_BREAKFST
