16,gqh9zbe,I mean they could have but even if they did buy and sell it wont have a SIGNIFICANT impact because a couple days back they shorted about 4 mil plus but it still rose but hey do you own research I'm just saying some stuff I noticed . I personally don't care about the price of stock when it goes down for GME but when it goes up by above 50 percent in a day I do. The reason being this stock is hella manipulated unless it's going up,1,0,1615402694,redditstuff1

64,gqha04y,"They can do it until it works or it doesn‚Äôt. 

By that I mean they‚Äôre using small amounts (relative to their potential losses) to move the stock down. 

If people panic and sell, they‚Äôve driven the stock down and achieved their goal. If people do not sell they just threw a ton of money in the toilet. 

However they also win in that they were able to put a halt on trading, again, when there was momentum upwards. If the stock puts on another 100 points to get back to where it was before the manipulation in another hour, it‚Äôs not the same as if the stock had kept trading for that hour at the higher price.",1,0,1615402704,davidjschloss
