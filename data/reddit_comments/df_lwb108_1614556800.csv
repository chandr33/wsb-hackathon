2,gpgafmj,Yikes..when I tried to contact RH support they sent a generic message back saying they already sent 1099s this year (not answering my question),1,0,1614715335,hintofsass
3,gpgajfc,"I haven’t seen this, but if RH is reporting that on your 1099, I would go through all your transactions and your families transactions with a fine toothed comb and prove that you didn’t purchase that security. As to where/who to report that to, my best guess would be a financial lawyer in your town who specializes in stock broader fraud. From their, they can file a claim and see if this has affected others and initiate a class action if deemed necessary.",2,0,1614715382,Vbo23
