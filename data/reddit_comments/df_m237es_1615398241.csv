[Here's the link to yesterday's comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16emz/gme_megathread_for_march_09_2021/gqd7afb/) I will edit this comment with my thoughts on GME throughout the day. 

Please forgive me about the confusion yesterday. My last comment got deleted without an explanation. I did not delete my comments. This caused a lot of panic for those following along. Mods, if there is anything I am doing wrong, please let me know so I can correct and prevent another take down.

For Corporate America, I offer you this DD.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that 🚀🚀🚀.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

🦍🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but 🍌🍌🍌 for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 216

**Update 12:44 Halt #4**

What the actual fuck. They're not even trying to be subtle here.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 198

**Update 12:48 Halt #5**

Another halt, this time after a jump up to 203.5. 

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 203.50

**Update 12:53 Halt #6**

SLINGSHOT!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

* Current price: 262.46

**Update 1:00**

GME is volatile as fuck right now. It seems to be stabalizing around 260 at the moment, but we just don't have enough data after the halt to make a good prediction on it's current trajectory. 260 would still be above where it started, so it would technically be a win for GME, though it's nowhere near the 350 it was at prior to the drop.

Mid update update

Stock is now around 240. I don't even have enough time to comment between major moves anymore. Hold on tight.

* Shorts available 200,000

* Current price: 250

**Update 1:09**

I have to use the bathroom. Please forgive me if I miss another halt.

* Current price: 244.32

**Update 1:17 Halt #7**

God damnit, can't I take a piss without another halt? I don't even know why we're stopped.

* Current price: 263.95

**Update 1:19**

Y'all, my lunch ends in 10 minutes. I'm going to try to keep y'all updated after lunch at the risk of getting fired. This shit is absolutely insane right now.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 258.36

**Update 1:26**

So the shorts available have not changed according to IBorrowDesk. What this means is that the SHITs are getting their shorts from somewhere else, or the 500,000 that were borrowed in pre-market were held back until the lunch attack. This way, the number on IBorrowDesk doesn't change right after the drop, so it can look like it wasn't them. I'm willing to bet money that a good portion if not all of those 500,000 shorts were used during the lunch attack.

GME is recovering from that blast and is making it's way back towards 300. We'll see if the trajectory has changed after the attack.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 278.96",4947,76,1615398244,Corno4825
