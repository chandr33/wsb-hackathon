If you don't want to get assigned on something, you can always buy the contract back on expiration day.

Learning options is interesting, fun, and dangerous. I once woke up to a short 300 shares of AAPL position when I started out. I learned to always close spreads on expiration day, because if you hold an itm short option through expiration you will get assigned even if it is part of a spread!",2,0,1615341493,commentingrobot
