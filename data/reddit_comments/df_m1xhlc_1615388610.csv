46,gqg9t3z,"Back in Jan I sold 1000 shares at $400. I held onto 500 shares in case it kept going up. It didn’t. I held when it went back down to the 40s. I never bought more, big mistake. I then sold my 500 when it spiked to $180 in late Feb for no apparent reason. I thought it would go back down to the 70s where I would reload massively. It never did. Now here I am buy chunks at $159, $190 and now $280. Not as near as many shares but man does that sting that I had the chance and didn’t pull the trigger in the 50s",12,0,1615388622,PleaseCaIIMeSir
