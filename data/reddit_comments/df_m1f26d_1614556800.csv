18,gqdaywi,"All the ""diamond hand forever"" apes really want is for you to hold until THEIR exit shows up. To some extent yes we all must HODL but ultimately, and it should go without saying, that every person has to bounce when comfortable. I'm not here to make anyone money but myself. And since were all on the same rocket well that just works out well for everyone. Personally I play with money I can lose and not care. Some apes don't though. And for those apes, I have no heartburn if they get some tendies and bounce. If they cause a dip I'll buy their shares. I like discounts. But everyone gotta put food on the table. ü¶çüíéüôå",15,0,1615321644,Savagely_Rekt
