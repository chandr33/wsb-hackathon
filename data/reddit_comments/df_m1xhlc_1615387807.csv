My stock is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my stock is useless. Without my stock, I am useless. I must hold my stock true. I must hold longer than my enemy who is trying to rob me. I must rob him before he robs me. I will...

My stock and I know that what counts in the market is not the charts we watch, the price of anything, nor the profits we see. We know that it is the HOLD that counts. We will HOLD...

My stock is human, even as I am human, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its fundamentals, its short interest, its prospect and its value. I will keep my stock close and ready, even as I am close and ready. We will become a part of each other. We will...

Before God, I swear this creed. My stock and I are the defenders of my fellow retards. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is WSB's and there is no enemy, but peace.",20,0,1615387823,Jdubya87
