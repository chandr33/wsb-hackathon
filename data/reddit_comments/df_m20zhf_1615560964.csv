10,gqxwwmk,Company denies all claims and say they are lies and short is making this shit up.

12,gqy2qs6,"I don't have any positions or shorts in them, either.

But apparently I get downvoted just for posting facts about the lawsuit. Don't trade with blinders on, WSB, omg.",2,0,1615757123,curunir
13,gqy7gc9,"yeah, you make a valid point that they are being sued. its a fact and deserves to be looked at and assessed. 

I guess you get downvotes because the great overhwhelming majority of these hedge funds are just straight up fkn liars though for real. 

I just watched Plotkin lie to Congress today. He straight up told Congress that wallstreetbets invested in Gamestop because hate Jews. Seriously. That's what he said. He said we discussed it and that was our motive. I never once heard anyone ever say anything anti-semitic the whole time I ever read about Gamestop and only bought after I heard that Ryan Cohen got on board, so yeah. And Cohen is a Jewish name too. 

Hedge funds are notorious fkn liars. Have you seen that Jim Cramer video about when he ran a hedge fund and would lie and stir up shit to drop a stock price? Anyone can sue anyone and people do it all the time, especially if it puts money in their pockets. So yeah, the downvotes might just be so noobs don't see your comment and get FUD.",1,0,1615759122,MinimalDysfunction
