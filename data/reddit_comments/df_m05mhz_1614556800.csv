0,gq62agj,This isn’t a company you should be looking to make a short term profit on even though it’s possible. Doesn’t matter what price you buy at right now anything in the 20s is fine if you plan to hold for a while.,1,0,1615170368,HammerForks

6,gq62gyr,If you think it will increase by a significant amount in the future a drop really wouldn’t benefit you all the much. Timing the market is extremely difficult and involves a certain amount of luck. Personally if I was you and thought in the future it would increase by a significant margin I would just buy and hold. If it dips buy more on the dip and average down a bit. I’m not a financial advisor just my two cents,1,0,1615170468,ecrane2018
7,gq62kgj,Absolutely not looking short term. I don’t think I’ll ever let go of whatever shares I can afford. They represent a chunk of the future that I want a piece of.,1,0,1615170523,Weekly_Okra3859

9,gq62lf5,"I bought them on Thursday because I think the price is pretty good. It could drop further, or it could head back up now. No one really knows. 

An important lesson I learned last year is that it’s impossible to time the exact top and bottom. We usually just get lucky when that happens. If you like the stock and you think it’s worth a lot more, then just get in when you can. buying it at 21 or 24 won’t make that much of a difference and the risk is that you never get in if you keep waiting for rock bottom.",1,0,1615170538,Mr_Robotto
10,gq62nu0,This reaffirms what I was thinking myself. Figured it was worth asking to see what others though though. Appreciate it,1,0,1615170574,Weekly_Okra3859
11,gq62t79,This aligns with what I thinking as well. Really just wanted to ask and see if maybe someone had someone insight that I didn’t since many people on here seem to be privy / research info that isn’t all that obvious.,1,0,1615170657,Weekly_Okra3859
12,gq62wjq,Do it then.,1,0,1615170708,Rrrrandle
13,gq62yrm,Agreed. I don’t see this as a meme stock. This company represents a major innovation in my opinion and I think with just a bit more work this tech could quote literally change the world,1,0,1615170743,Weekly_Okra3859

16,gq636kv,"There’s always it could go lower I mean tech is in a weird spot right now and sure you could pick it up at 18 maybe or you could buy at 21-25ish hold, dips down to 18 or below you have some more cash to throw at it maybe an equal investment you have more shares then you would’ve if you just put your initial in at 18. As well as having a decent cost avg in the low 20s. Your also covered if you buy right now and the price goes up if tech recovers from this correction I don’t really see a downside to buying in right now. Especially if you believe and plan on long term",1,0,1615170861,ecrane2018

24,gq63r9h,"Here's what you need to ask yourself if you're truly looking long term (year+): 
Where do I think the price will be in a year or 2 from now? 

If you feel that number is considerably higher than it is right now.  Then what does a couple points lower matter? If you think this is a 50+ dollar stock down the road then why try to time the absolute bottom when that would be a double from here? If you could've bought Amazon or Tesla stock a few years ago would a few points really have mattered?",1,0,1615171179,thewrecker8

31,gq64xpu,"If you plan long, this shouldn't be an issue. Getting in now is a no brainer and a few cents +/-  shouldn't be the deciding factor for your entry point. From what I can see, pltr has a promising future with real potential. So anything sub $30 is a bargain imo. But what do I know, I'm just another smooth brain so take what I say with a grain of salt.

45,gq66fo2,"You may want to look into an option with an insane lead to ""test"" the waters. Personally even though I have shares, when the stock does a swan dive I look at the options for at the money 1 year out. So for around 1000 bucks you can pick up a contract for 100 shares at like 25 strike or something.

There's more risk than shares outright. But if you think it's going to be higher than 35/share in a year (25 + 10 premium) if it's at like 60 in a year, you can exercise if you want those shares or sell the contract for the IV.

46,gq66tpa,"Comparing apples and organges, Adobe is a software company that has domination of their market. Their market cap is worth like 400 billion. PLTR is roughly 40 billion. So i think if they really kill it and take over with their software, which is possible with their huge moat and advanced software, I like to think they could be worth that big. So a 10 bagger.
