IF cruising does return this year, it will NOT be at maximum capacity.  That means fewer beverage/alcohol packages/fewer rooms booked/fewer gamblers in casino /fewer cruise excursions, etc.

To restart cruising that will take millions of dollars.  They'll be lucky to make a profit 2021 or even 2022.

In short they used a Major Refit / Refirb exemption to get the ship approved to come through the NZ border. This exemption allows visa's for the delivery crew (just people actually required to deliver the ship). They departed, with all their hotel staff on board too, then applied for their visa's, then acted all surprised when Immigration NZ didn't grant all the hotel worker's visa's.

Ultimately they went away again with their tail between their legs.",1,0,1614766571,s_nz

41,gpmdie3,"Feel free to do what you want but why put your money in a ticker that seems to have so much going against it?

Billions in debt, hundreds of millions to resume operations (you can't just resume cruising overnight), smaller fleet/fewer ships , fewer passengers = fewer alcoholic/beverage packages, fewer gamblers in casinos , fewer shore excursions, fewer rooms booked all because you are physically limited by fewer ships + covid restrictions (?),etc.

Lets not forget the diluted shares and the 10+% interest rate on some of their loans. 

No cruising in 2021 until maybe end of the year.  No profit in 2021and lucky to break even 2022.  What's going to drive the stock up?

The list goes on and on and on.  It just seems like a risky move.

If you believe in the stock, then more power to you.",1,0,1614833870,eatmyshortsmelvin
42,gpmj4sw,"Iâ€™m just looking at the price action since the March of last year lows to today. Check the charts. Itâ€™s been rising to pre pandemic since then. 

I bought leaps at the bottom, so Iâ€™m already sitting on a lot of unrealized. 

All your points are valid, but itâ€™s all public information. The market already knows this, and despite this info, it is drifting up to pre pandemic levels.  Why?  Because the market believes Cruising as a global human past time will continue on for another 100 years. 

If I didnâ€™t have a position Iâ€™d be scared of the elevated risk at these levels, too. 

But itâ€™s truly a binary bet. Will Cruise ships end?  I donâ€™t think they will.",1,0,1614837685,videogamesjdkdjdj
