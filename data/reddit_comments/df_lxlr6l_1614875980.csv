4,gpo3ybe,"Thank you.  What is up with all the meme videos lately?  Not that I have any say over what content is/isn't allowed on WSB, but I think this would be a much better place with an outright ban on memes.

&gt; Image Submissions: If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.",-6,0,1614876164,MrZeeBud
