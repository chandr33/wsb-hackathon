Its been god knows how many days since this started. I think at least 3 years by the amount of hair I've lost during this time. Sometime I fear the squeeze may not come.

GME started all this short squeeze talk, there is no ‚Äúnext GME‚Äù. You‚Äôre chasing something that isn‚Äôt there. GME is the only short squeeze play, and if it doesn‚Äôt squeeze nothing will. Everything else is just a long play, or a hedge fund distraction.
