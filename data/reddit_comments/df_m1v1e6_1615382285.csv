25,gqfxko1,"Honestly, pretty much noone knows a lot about trading. There are some neat statistical models to value option prices and knowing what combination of options bought and sold has which expected outcomes  is some icing on the cake. But so far noone has found a formula to consistently beat the market.

Some larger funds have decent strategies but those are more of an art than a pure formula and even they make bad trades. 

Yeah I sold about 30% of my stocks with an average price below $20 at $498. Somehow I managed to hit that one hour window where the stock was flying in premarket right before RH announced they'd disable buying GME to realize some gains.

41,gqfxlmo,"So I overheard my ex-wifes boyfriend saying the he thinks the $NVDA play in response to the chip shortage news is a mistake.  I think its a complete misread of the problem, and of what these companies actually do.

$NVDA doesn't manufacture their own chips.  Almost everyone buys them from $TSM. $NVDA, $AMD, etc, only design and assemble the chips manufactured elsewhere.

$TSM is low on chips because A. The demand is high.  And B. punative measure by the mainland on Taiwan if affecting the $TSM supply chain.

So I don't think $TSM is the play either, because I know the CCP wants to destroy that company and take their customers. Although maybe in the short term they will be able to raise prices due to demand, I don't know.


The US *really* needs their own domestic chip factory on US mainland soil.  It's a huge national security weakness.
