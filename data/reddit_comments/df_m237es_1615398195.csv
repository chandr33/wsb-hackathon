Edit: That wasn't meant to be a slight against anyone we care for. Just a statement of fact. An intelligent investor would slowly sell a position to maximize the sell price. The only reason to sell in mass like that is to crash the price, it should be looked at for market manipulation because in doing so they earned less than what they would have if they sold it slowly, which infers the reason for selling wasn't to make money on the sale.",-11,0,1615398199,phryan
