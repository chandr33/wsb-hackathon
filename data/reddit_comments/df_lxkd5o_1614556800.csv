35,gpnroyz,Your so wrong. Portnoy has a cult like following that will attack anyone who criticizes him and buy into anything he throws their way. I know a guy who was literally show me and my friends his investment in PENN solely because Portnoy is attached to it.

39,gpny068,"Oh I'm with you. Listening to anything he has to say is stupid as fuck. Even outside of his investment advice. Barstool is for dumbass douchebags. I really can't stand him. But he has nothing to do with this ETF except getting paid to promote it. What really happened was he was that he attached himself to all the attention that wsb was getting and went on the news pretending to be the spokes person for it. Then the ETF which supposedly tracks social media decided to capitalize on that fact by promoting it as the ""reddit trader etf"" so who better to sell this shit than the guy who has millions of followers that will do anything he says, who already named themselves the spokes person for that kind of trading. Except for the fact that BUZZ has nothing to do with the stocks talked about here it's basically a FAANG/tech stock fund. It's stupid to think that you would even need to make an social media algo to pick the stocks that are in that fund. Part of me wants to see it crash and burn, but it's so generalized in big cap tech stocks that it would probably mean the market is crashing.",2,0,1614873581,hipster3000

46,gpo53aq,"PENN owns 36% of Barstool, that‚Äôs why he has shares in PENN lol. Several million dollars worth of the sale came in the form of PENN shares. Credit where it‚Äôs due since he says he‚Äôs bought more, but investing in your own company is hardly the same as being a good investor. 

He‚Äôs a great business man, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. He tried his hand at day trading and was absolutely atrocious at it, then lost 700k in 2 days trying to hop on the GME/AMC train.",7,0,1614876651,Triv02
47,gpo67p8,"Yep same here. My first thoughts when I heard portnoy got an ETF were to short it but after I saw what was going in it I lost interest. Just a regular old etf run by a sports analyst lol. It's an ETF for the folks in the sports community who want exposure to the market but don't know anything about it so they see Dave &amp; know he has alot of money and think they're getting an inside route to the reddit ""meme"" stocks. The people this is intended for probably won't even check to see what it's holding, just get in blindly and tell their friends what big investors they are now lol.",1,0,1614877134,CapitolGee34

50,gpoabi4,"We just going to ignore the 650k he lost day trading back in April 2020, a month where the Dow went up almost 3000 points?

Edit: the most attractive thing about BUZZ is that Dave's name is attached to it, but he has no actual say in where your money goes. He knows about as much about the stock market as your average WSB user, and has admitted as much. But his name being attached to it is of course a good thin",9,0,1614878903,Triv02

53,gpoetce,"I'm not clutching at anything lol, he literally tweeted *today* that he doesn't know how the stock market works and you shouldn't trust him.

You're allowed to like Barstool and think Dave is a great businessman without thinking he literally walks on water and is good at everything he does. Again, he knows as much about the market as your average WSB trader, and that's okay because he's not actually investing your money in anything",1,0,1614880814,Triv02
