19,gpjhmxn,Everyone said stay away from cruise stocks just like you. Guess what they are up 150-200% in one year. You gotta buy what people would buy when things go back to normal.,2,0,1614784593,hogujak

21,gpjjaqa,"I think you missed the boat for cruise stocks.  They tanked hard at the start of the pandemic and have almost recovered those losses, before they board a single new passenger.

Cruises are still being pushed out, all the companies have taken on significant new debt (and diluted existing stonk holders), and have retired a number of ships (older, smaller, less profitable ships but still meaningful capacity cuts).

Yes, people will be cruising as soon as they can.  But it won't be near the same volume of passengers for quite some time.  

Unless you think they were undervalued at the end of 2019, most of the upside is already priced in for the major cruise lines.",1,0,1614785337,exjackly

27,gpjpesm,"I would've thought the same, but most of the 65+ people I talked to about cruising are ready to cruise again and 1/2 of them have a future cruise booked, and some with multiple cruises booked.  I think the pent-up demand will drive these stocks above pre-pandemic levels.",3,0,1614788030,Repeat-Tasty
28,gpjpupt,"You are comparing just the per share price.  Both companies have had significant stock dilution.  Plus, they have taken on large amounts of new debt to maintain operations until they can sail again.

If they had the same shares outstanding and debt levels, I would agree with you.  But the company isn't in the same position it was.  The extra shares and debt are going to be a drag on earnings for years.  The current price is assuming that they will be able to ramp up - without adverse on board events - quickly once they get permission to resume.",2,0,1614788221,exjackly
29,gpjq8be,"I belive you, but not this and not next year. If they would be able to run their boats on full capacity maybe next year, but I just cannot see this happen.",2,0,1614788384,Hirsoma
30,gpjtilb,"Yes, they have taken on debt and been diluted, but I think the pent-up demand will offset it and potentially allow for an increase in cruise prices as well as allow them to book significantly more revenue for future cruises.

The vaccine rollouts will  reduce the potential for any adverse on-board events.",2,0,1614789784,Repeat-Tasty
31,gpju0ve,By 2022 I think we will see a entertainment boom. Anything that deals with vacations or entertainment will have amazing years imo. Lots of people have pent up entertainment cravings. Imo you basically can't go wrong with anything like cruise lines. But I also got 25 NLCH shares for 10 bucks each a year ago so this has been a very long term play for me.,5,0,1614789996,thefirstofthe77
32,gpjyj13,"I hope you are right.  I just don't see it happening.

Capacity is down.  Even if the demand is there instantly, there are fewer ships with less total capacity left in the fleets than before the pandemic.  Multiple ships have been tried without replacements online.  Increased prices will only offset a party of that.

Vaccines will help, but a lot of countries (including those with popular ports of call) are very sensitive to any positive cases - and likely will be for years as new variants and new diseases keep popping up.  And, it isn't just coronavirus that is going to get news coverage.  Any contagious illness or food poisoning is going to get excessive coverage.

I think the cruise lines, including these two are fairly priced.  They could move up further, but in my opinion pre-pandemic highs are years away.  I think there are much better choices available.

I'm not a financial advisor.  Make your own bets.  I want these companies to do well, but I'm not opening any new positions in this industry.",2,0,1614791911,exjackly
