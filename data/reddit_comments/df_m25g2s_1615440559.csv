In my opinion, and this is just my two cents, the marketplace was created so that people who believed in a company could buy a portion of the company. In return of buying this stock, the company has money to expand/grow, and the shareholders value increases. Thus, more people (the masses) believing in a company, and subsequently investing in it because they believe in the company and think their product is going to keep improving and/or profiting. 

But I also think day trading is nothing more than market manipulation on a microscopic scale. The companies or their products often mean very little to them; it’s all about what is red or green.

**PDT does not apply to cash only accounts**.

If you contact your broker and ask directly for a cash account only (which means, yes, you'll have to wait days at a time for bank transfers and money from selling stocks), you will **NOT** be flagged for pattern day trading as long as you do not use unsettled funds (which, again, means waiting for your money to actually hit your account).

Once they got news of the halt and especially if they have media on the exchange floor then they can anticipate the drop and release the story.  They could even retract the story if needed.
