Large profits, potentially undervalued, a buy back which was announced but did not seem to take place yet, forthcoming earning report where people speculated the announcement of a dividend, and apparently it was strangely highly shorted so if there was movement that would help.

I went in on it at a comfort level for a newb @$20.15.
