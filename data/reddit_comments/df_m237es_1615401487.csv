53,gqh709p,"Yes. 

Someone liquidated a bunch of GME (likely to cover their own shorts, but that part is pure speculation). That caused a drop and a halt. Meanwhile people started selling, not understanding that a halt means A HALT. This creates a backlog of sell orders that are continually executed every time the halt is lifted. All these sell orders tank the price, triggering more halts.

61,gqh70eu,"**Once the hedgies go boom, is the broker/lender obligated to jump on the grenade?**

I pondered the following presumptions:

* The same hedgefunds that shorted last time shorted again cuz never learn
* That they can be utterly vaporized by their overexposure
* Their obligation then rolls uphill, but perhaps the delivery requirements change and uphill can be like ""nah, we aint paying that much, we'll wait because we can"" and then they watch the retail traders race to the bottom.

I saw this a basis to calculate a potential rough *upper ceiling* before the upwards pressure reality changes. We can do some napkin math to arrive at a perhaps meaningless number, calculated out of sheer random curiosity:

**Hedgefunds shortsaling GME in Jan, and their AUMs**

Point72 -- 17 billion  
D1 Capital -- 13 billion  
Melvin Capital -- 8 billion  
Maplelane -- 7 billion

Hedgie assets: **45 billion**  
GME Float: **54 million**

Conclusion: At a share price of **$833** all the hedgefunds that were in the battle in January could be destroyed, if they had to cough up the entirety of the float against their total assets. However, I freely admit this number is flawed because it would never be a perfect distribution, but it's a good starting point. This is our bare minimum, anyone who paperhands before this should be hunted down and pelted with Cramer Cakes (from ape's backside)

But lets say that did happen, at that price or even significantly higher. All of them are bankrupted. At that point their short covering obligations are transferred back to the brokers, who were the lenders of the shorted shares to hedgies, who may not necessarily have to deliver *immediately* or ***at all***, as they typically have a maximum liability exposure by their *customer loan consent* and *hypothecation agreements* with the margin account holders who lent the shares in the first place, right?

From what I've been reading, they could theoretically get away with settling immediately with cash for the securities current market value. So if the price hit 1200, they could be like ""We misplaced your security holding, heres the cash value per share to make up for your lost position, sorry""

They could also perhaps just leave your shares in limbo, until you actually try to do something with them. If you just let them sit there, they could wait until the dip and cover it then. And since the hedgies upward pressure would be gone, the price could freefall. And they could also immediately match any cash-accounts selling shares to cover your position. You may never know there was ever even a problem.

That or I'm just completely retarded ape who started learning about the market last Thursday, but I suspect that the brokerages don't necessarily have jump on the grenade. Could some apes with more brain wrinkles educate me and the other apes? This seems like a glaring case of devil details the apes hoping GME's market cap eclipses the World GDP are willfully overlooking. Because there is a mile of redtape between the broker and the margin account stockholders who originally owned the borrowed security.

tl;dr: **If the hedgies get ganked, do the brokers have ways of biding their time and not escalating the market price? Can they snatch the rocket right out of the air?**
