Either (1) a HF or several HFs did a massive sell off to depreciate the price; (2) perhaps the company issued more shares from treasury (but this seems unlikely to me, there's lots of procedural and legal hurdles to issuing more shares. Didn't do in-depth research into GME's charter and bylaws but I think this is unlikely); or (3) just a lot of sophisticated institutional investors sold a ton of shares at $345-ish.
