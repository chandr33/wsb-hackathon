For those of you retards that are thinking this is a good stock, stay away.  Just a warning.  

Their CEO has legitimately pissed off the entire broker community by issuing an ultimatum to them.  UWMC is going to try and fine brokers $5000 a piece who send loans to lenders not on the approved UWMC list.

Tonight's poll on a brokers only site [around 120 independent brokers] shows that 8% are considering using UWM and that 73% refuse to sign their ultimatum.
