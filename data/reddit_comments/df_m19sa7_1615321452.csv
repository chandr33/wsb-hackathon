Now that you're thinking of the Air Force Academy, you need to understand that wall street is worse. It is *made* by the nepotistic, inherited, dark power of wealth, not merely co-opted by it through religion or politics. It is a place where the intersection of power and competence is a *fluke*, not the norm, but because of the tools power gives, the consequences of incompetence are often trivial anyway.

That triviality can fuel an infinite quantity of arrogance. If nothing has the power to stop you... why stop?

The last major crash due to ridiculous assfuckery was in 2008 during a people friendly administration and bailouts were aplenty. Last massive protest against inequality and the elite was Occupy Wall Street just a few years after that and it fizzled out after accomplishing next to nothing. What's really needed are people high up in government who are much more sympathetic to our cause and who can actually make wall street bleed. However without getting dark money out of politics that shit won't change because politicians don't like chopping off their own hands.  Bailouts will likely happen and the only lessons learned by Wall Street will be how to fuck us over in new ways. We do not have control because the people in power do not actually represent us.

&gt;
&gt;-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.
