If you were walking down the street and a stranger started spewing all of these GME conspiracies at you, would you be compelled to listen? Or to walk much faster? That's what these posts look like. Chill out.

I'm long AMC and I do have some GME waiting to see what happens. The GME meme was fun for a while but the cognitive dissonance is getting concerning now. It's become a religion to you. It's a fucking stock. 

Take a breather. This is unhealthy. The world is not conspiring against you. If you truly like the stock, holding should be a no-brainer and you shouldn't need an echo chamber of conspiracy to keep your eyes on the prize.
