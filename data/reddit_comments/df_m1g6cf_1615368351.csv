Next stop: retards at $300-$400.",1,0,1615368353,jamesy9555
1,gqfgphp,"Ok so I ran a quick math. GME 800c expiring friday is 1.09 at the ask. Theta is .87, and delta is .02. GME closed at 246 yesterday and currently on pace for a 300 open. If it does, multiply delta by the difference in close and open AND subtract current theta, your 1.09 would be 1.30 at open. That's not bad, and assuming it keeps going up with renewed delta and gamma, 800cs are a pretty good bet today.",1,0,1615368355,YoungJebediah
