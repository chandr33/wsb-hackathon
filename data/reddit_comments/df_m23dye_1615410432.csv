3,gqhsjlb,If they actually want to scare us CNBC should release an article praising GME and telling us to buy.,1,0,1615410567,CIB
4,gqhsnk7,"I do understand that 100%, the part that doesn't fit though is there was no article about the rise. Why would there be an immediate article about a 40% drop but NOT a 400%+ increase? I'd argue there was no pre-written article about the rise but there WAS about the drop. The aticle originally was posted at 12:41 EST and the drop to 198 was from 12:20-12:45. They posted the article WHILE it was happening.  


Context matters and in this case the context was ignoring the rise and reporting the fall. Not to mention articles aren't published solo without any oversight. For an article to appear someone else has to at the very least approve a proof in a professional setting. The proof went through WHILE it happened in that 20 minute span?  


Also context on me: idgaf who the article is by, CNBC, CNN, FOX, don't care, the content and context is what matters to me.",12,0,1615410616,iWushock
