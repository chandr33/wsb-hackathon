2. if the squeeze happens the curve will go much higher and faster because they'll need to buy A LOT of shares
3. the squeeze will last days, it will not be for a short time, depending on the amount of shares they have to buy (I have no clue) and the supply in the market, could last 3 days or even more. It all depends on how many shorts they need to cover and even if we have a lot of DD nobody really know and it's all speculations, only the hedge funds know what they have done.",1,0,1615383612,adarkuccio
