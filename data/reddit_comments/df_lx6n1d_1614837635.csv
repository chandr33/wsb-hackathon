8,gpmjwyo,"Ok, I'm an idiot, so bear with me. In the spirit of testing this hypothesis further, I want to know how you extrapolated this data. I'm too high to discern the data provided by your Yahoo Finance link, though I did try.

If what I'm seeing is correct, it appears that there are now institutional investors circling each other on both sides of this thing, along with retail investors, trying to avoid being left out of a chair when the music stops.

The media cycle is desperately steering attention away from anyone but the Little Guy (i.e. Crayon-sucking Apes) being implicated culpable. Like a free market mask, they run noise for whoever is paying their bills, helping to hide the signal by using the Reddit wilderness as a straw man.

The call-put list you've posted shows a strong financial gaze upward, increasing in volume parallel with strike price, which makes me suspect Uncle Bruce's bagel-eatin' ass was right about some things.

What does anyone suppose the combined premiums are on all those options? What moron would dare be left on the wrong side of those contracts? Especially naked. Something fucked up is happening. I smell it with my scaley nostrils.

Honestly better if I don't elaborate too much on that. I'm wondering what y'all think.",1,0,1614838281,A_Grey_Dragon

21,gpmkv8m,"Hedge Funds who are 1 million or more shares deep on their short positions understand they can't cover with high volumes. Most of Gamestop's 50 mil float is held by ETFs, and institutions (new players). Total liquidity trading back and forth is about 15-25 million shares, with a large chunk being held by retail traders.

As soon as big money day traders see the type of batch orders coming in that look like covering, they'll hop on board and lower the supply even more. 1 million shorts covering could drive the price from 115 to 180 or higher easily.

So what's the solution? Call options. **Same day expiry** call options.

Pay the premium to aquire 20,000 contracts. Execute them all, and force the Chicago stock exchange (in charge of options) to go out and find your shares. The Hedge fund gets all million shares to cover (plus another million to go long on and recoup short losses) at the $120 price point, while the Exchange suffers the consequences of driving up the price. There is no legal requirement to disclose options trades to the SEC or anyone else either. These hedge funds can operate toootally in the dark.

Also, about 25-50 million shares were naked sold in those options contracts. The exchanges don't have the supply on hand to cover the rapidly increasing pool of ITM call options. This is going to become a MONSTER gamma squeeze if upward price pressure is maintained.",14,0,1614839008,jaboyles

74,gpmr7ug,"Disclaimer : I'm going to say something retarded.

A 100ish years ago my fore fathers were in the trenches. Poor people sent to fight to death by rich and powerful, greedy after each other for land and ressources. Some died there. Some came back but lost almost everything. Their houses, their friends, parts of their bodies and sometimes their minds. No one can imagine the sacrifices they made in the hope of a maybe fairer world. But I can tell after each day spent at the front they felt burnt and hopeless and yet went back for more until the very end.

The efforts we are doing now are nothing compared to them. We go into a financial battlefield everyday, come back burnt and shaken but we still CHOOSE to go. We are not in the trenches, we are into shitty flats, going back to work at day. Some of us will lose everything. Some of us will ride into triumph. I can't tell what's going to happen but I know we are on the right side of this selfish ugly battle for greed once again and I'm glad I'm standing my ground.",5,0,1614844360,RevolutionaryHair91
