11,gqdncyy,"Webull and some other brokers let you do ""paper trading"" for free. All the features of normal stock trades using realtime stock market data, but it's just a simulation.

So you can try some different investing strategies, learn options, go crazy, win big, lose big, move in with your wife's boyfriend, and it's all just on paper.

It can be a fun and addictive game; you get a similar rush to trading real stocks while you figure out if this whole casino thing is really for you.",1,0,1615327126,yParticle
