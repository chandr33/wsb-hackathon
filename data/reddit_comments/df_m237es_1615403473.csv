65,gqhbvsn,"Important lesson learned:  Don't use market order for volatile stocks.  Learn about limit orders.

3 shares at 279 is an average.  Their system looked at what is available right now when it got the order.  If 2 shares were for sale at 239 and another at 350 (i didn't do the math, just an example), they buy all three and call it filled at 3 for 279.  Market order just says 'i want this many shares, i'll pay what the market asks'.  A limit order lets you control what you are willing to pay.",2,0,1615403486,mylicenseisexpired

And don't be discouraged. Yes the system is rigged to benefit the wealthy - unfortunately this was only exacerbated by the trump reign, but situations like this prove that retail can indeed fight back against Wall street. There is hope. The best part is that people on this sub value their earnings so much more than those hedge fund shills and hopefully they'll use it to help those around them.
