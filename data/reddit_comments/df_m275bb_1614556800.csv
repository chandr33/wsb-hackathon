20,gqji6eo,"It turns out a lot of the advice that old people believe to be facts are just things and sayings used to bring them down and keep them there. Their mindset is always one of scarcity and one where if you have something it's important to protect it. While the winning mindset should be the one of abundance and growth where the stuff you have (money) in this case is just a tool to create more and progress your future instead of protecting your present. It's just like how sports are changing due to analytics so is the stock market. We realized the mid range and the post are not good shots in basketball and the game adapted and destroyed the players and teams that didn't. Same with baseball and the home run vs the old way of base running and batting average. The game is changing, the stock market is having a sort of fundamental shift from the old flawed thinking to the new progressive thinking. It's either adapt with the times or get left in the dust, hopefully these boomers can adjust but either way I'm getting my tendies 🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚",1,0,1615443334,zingis75
