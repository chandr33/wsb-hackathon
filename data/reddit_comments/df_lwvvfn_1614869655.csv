Unless I am blind or dumb, Melvin has no interest in this company at the moment. It's one thing to say look at the short interest, good opportunity.

Turned out to be right on all accounts and I have had a phenomenal 6 months. Made about $50,000 compared to if I just invested in a sp500 etf, and about 3000 bps alpha.

My guess is that anyone that could take profits @ $20 did so.  Remember, this is a company valued at $1.6B with $390M in revenue (TTM)--and it's TTM revenue has been declining since 2019, before COVID.  $20 is probably on the richer end of the valuation I would assign to it and, given the continued uncertainty, if given the opportunity, it was likely time to cash out.

Add that to the fact that the entire market got wiped, I'm not shocked that SKT couldn't hold it's gains.",1,0,1614896249,cplange1
