I would also target my money at companies that are actually doing good things in the world.

Hell, I might even run for office and try to help enact policies that minimize the influence of the cock sucking leaches we call the 1%.

Just dumping it all in an index fund can offset your future payments by a significant amount.  You need money to make money.  This shift in mindset is critical to transition to the middle class.",2,0,1615327587,apoliticalinactivist
