39,gpl957y,Dog shit talk on this one is very similar to GME back in the day. As a WSB vet I approve and am also long SDC as a growth/spec trade. 2500 shares total and have been accumulating since $7 May 2020. Bought an extra 86 today,15,0,1614812301,Resource_Purple

54,gq5wmf8,"Agreed. I got in right before earnings. Took a bit of a hit. But bought some more to average down. So hanging in there.
