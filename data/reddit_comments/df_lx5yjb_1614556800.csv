17,gplc1ay,"As a game dev personally i think this market is oversaturated, steam is already in an arms race with epic games. Also i might have to sell as i'd be an insider which would mean no lambo.

I think they should focus on expanding into the PC building, deliver on demand, collectables area and try and offer a more refined service than amazon - while also offering some downloadable content. Chewy has a $45M market cap in a $200BN industry. The gaming industry is predicted to reach $300BN by 2026, a similar trajectory would result in a market cap of 60BN for gamestop, i.e $1K a share. If i were a shortseller, i'd want to be well out of here before we find out.

Converting the stores into rentable gaming spaces for tournaments and team games could also be an interesting venture.

20,gple4hz,"The market is definitely not oversaturated. Right now with the current industry tools, it's becoming more and more possible for medium/smaller studios to release games and see explosive growth. Now let's consider there are only 4 places developers can realistically expect to release their games for a sizeable profit.

1. Publisher platforms ([Battle.net](https://Battle.net), Origin, Uplay, etc.) generally only contain games published by the platform owner. So if you aren't published by them, this isn't an option. If you want to be published, be ready to either sell your IP or give them a massive cut of your revenue. I am talking 40%+, and that's if they even want to publish you which most don't.
2. You could release on Epic, who are hungry for games right now, but dealing with them is a bit of a pain in the ass because they are still working out their process for publishing and distribution, marketing/advertising, and price points/sales. They have a ways to go, but they are definitely headed in the right direction.
3. Or you can go to Steam, where 90% of the industry launches on, because they are very well established and you can be sure that your game will not only be seen, but priced fairly with extremely refined launch and release support. The cost? A 30% cut of your revenue. And everyone pays this, non-negotiable (unless you are a big boy publisher and then negotiations absolutely happen).
4. Or you can go to GoG or other smaller platforms, which are definitely an option but since they aren't as widely known or accepted you run the risk of lower sales.

Considering the amount of releases on Steam vs Epic, I don't think Epic is competing effectively yet. They won't be for a couple of years, I don't think. They are going in the right direction, but they have a ways to go, especially when they have multiple things on the go that could sap resources from the expansion like their continued Engine development and work they have to continue to do as a Publisher for games like Fortnite.

Gamestop doesn't have that problem. They are 100% sales and distribution. 100% focused on that. Not publishing, not developing, not tech development or research, simply sales and distribution. Even Steam still has to continue publishing and development for games like CS:GO and DOTA2. Gamestop is free from the shackles of publishing and development, and can focus all of their attention on digital and physical sales and distribution, and that fucking excites me.",25,0,1614814771,Souperdev

GameStop already has an uphill battle with becoming an online presence.

28,gplhimq,"It won't be exclusivity deals, it will be a reduction in royalty rates. I would see 20% being still a massive revenue to them, without much required to get an online distribution platform up and running.

When Steam was first getting started over a decade ago, people thought the idea was rediculous. Now it's the industry standard. Steam's weakness is that they are a finely tuned, albeit large, machine. But large machines like that with as few developers to keep it running/make changes make things really hard to adapt to market changes.

Gamestop has the resources and connections to make it happen before Epic gets too deep, but their benefit is they aren't a publisher. They won't care about exclusives, they will just be an open distribution platform for games like their store is. And developers won't have a problem releasing there, because they can release on Steam AND Gamestop if they want, so there really is no downside.",-4,0,1614816524,Souperdev

Second, When developers release on a platform, if it isn't an exclusive there is nothing stopping them from releasing on multiple platforms. So as a dev, why wouldn't I release on Steam for a 30% cut AND Gamestop for a 20% cut (if they offer a reduction in royalties)?

I think you're looking at this too much from the publisher perspective, especially since you're a game dev yourself. its easy enough to attract publishers to your platform, you just need to put a lower fee, but how would they attract customers quickly? The only reason Epic games is even ""the second best competitor"" to steam is because fortnite went super giga viral. GoG only exists because The Witcher was a huge hit. Battle.net is because of WoW and Hearthstone. I think theres a reason why all these guys make their own games, and its probably similar to why Netflix invests so much to produce their own shows, shit attracts customers.

With none of their own games, they will never get the Fortnite crowd, the League of legends crowd, the WoW crowd and most importantly the CSGO and Dota 2 crowd. Players have their roots dug so deep i have no clue how they could dig them out.

44,gplnmgt,"Ehhh I don't know about the potential to overtake Steam. I think the potential to transition to a solid digital service is there, but Steam has been around for what, 18 years? They have so many features outside of just being an incredibly large digital store front. Message boards, user reviews, remote play, family share, coop streaming play, streaming, communities, chat, the market, steam workshop, etc. GameStop's digital storefront is going to have to find some very unique, enticing features to even think about making a dent in Steam's user base. 

Also the oversaturation is real, at least from a consumer standpoint. Right now I have Steam, Origin, Ubisoft Connect, Epic, Xbox, and the Microsoft Store, and even Stadia for some family that wanted to try gaming but didn't want a PC or console. Any time I'm crazy enough to buy something on any of those platforms (outside of Stadia) because there's a good sale I immediately add that game to my Steam library so I don't have to deal with the other apps. I get that I'm probably more of a hardcore example, but if I don't want to deal with multiple storefronts why would the more common gamer?

I'm excited for GameStop's digital turnaround too, but they're very late to a very crowded space and all those additional features will take expertise and resources they don't currently have, and quite a bit of time. As GameStop gets rolling every service will continue to improve their already existing services. By no means am I discounting your take from the developer side, but from where I'm at it's going to be a long road, but one I'm excited for nonetheless.

Edit - One more rational thought. A an adult that can appreciate the costs of business, reducing the cut the platform takes is great. As someone trying to play games, I don't give a shit. That won't attract a large user base.

79,gpm1wpf,"I like the idea, but to punch holes in the thesis, GameStop cannot simply become ""another Steam competitor"", that would be a true death knell on the coffin. Even if they dropped their cut of game sales to 10%, the problem is Steam has a locked in userbase that isn't going to move platforms. Epic Games and Twitch are giving away games to users for their platforms and (I'm assuming) their userbases are still dwarfed compared to Steam. Likewise, users have entire libraries on Steam they aren't going to abandon, and jumping between platforms is more trouble than just working on one. Its like Mixer vs. Twitch or anything vs. Facebook - its just easier to stay on the more popular platform, regardless of the other's features.

But, theorycrafting to avoid work, I have one idea that could make GME a 'Steam killer' - `allow users to resell their games`.

First, its a cornerstone to their business, and a meme to the world. 

More importantly, it plays into a weakness of digital gaming platforms not currently addressed by the other companies. Anyone with a Steam account owns dozens of games they've never played or even downloaded. But those games are just licenses to the game and once your refund period is over, its just a dead license if you never touch it. I'd gladly sell my unused license of ""Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee"" for less than $2.99 (Steam's current price). Or even let users sell licenses to games they just no longer play, like my ""PAYDAY 2"" (currently at $9.99). Let the game developer and GME get a cut of the sale and boom, money. Assuming that it'd be difficult to exploit such a system (as the upperbound would be the platform's own price for the game), they could even offer bundle license sales where you get X copies of a game you can resell after the fact. However, I'd say they'd need an economist whose studied Warcraft Auction House goblins to truly secure it. Digging deeper into the rabbit hole, if they could get Steam/Epic/etc platforms on board to allow selling/trading of their platforms' licenses, I think then you could see a major adoption in users.

86,gpm40x8,"I really hope you're right. It feels like such a monumental shift from where they're at right now it's hard to believe that's a direction they want to go, but given what we've seen them alluding to, a monumental shift does feel like it's in the works. I just hope it's able to pan out and doesn't implode before it takes off.

I've wanted to invest in Steam for years, but, you know. Private company. But that role in the industry prints so much money.",1,0,1614828423,exveelor

92,gpm96ta,Valve has IP that they don't use (or leave on the shelf to collect dust). Steam is where virtually all of their revenue is generated by selling other developers' games. But I understand and appreciate your point.,4,0,1614831263,GroundhogExpert
93,gpm9ur3,"I know, I'm saying while you started by saying how Steam is shit, but went on to describe how they rely on microtransaction and don't update their own games frequently enough,  i.e csgo, while both Steam and csgo came from Valve, pivoting to discussion of their game development doesn't help too much in this discussion, you could say the way Valve treats their own games are shit and therefore they will treat Steam shitty the same way, but its better to point out the actual flaws of the Steam platform itself if you would say its shit, to me I feel like user wise its definitely the leading platforms out there, but to developers the 30% cut is less and less attractive in the face of other competing platform like Epic",6,0,1614831644,DashLeJoker

Then GameStop asked if they could slightly change the agreement in their favor (after getting the money) and the console companies said yes.",6,0,1614831910,SunflowerSupreme
96,gpmbnq8,"I don't know why anyone would invest in a company thinking ""they're definitely gonna become a completely different company""... they could just buy a company better equipped to compete with steam than convert their retail company to do that.

it's true, physical release games are becoming less and less relevant, but hardware isn't... and no other chain trades in used hardware.  focusing on hardware is smart.  I have a few gamestop-branded controllers, and i've bought a couple used consoles from gamestop.  Their expansion into PC gaming is smart.  I'd buy an inspected or refurbished GPU from gamestop, and I'd trust them over some random vendor on Newegg for my next PC build.

it just seems like some top-level delusion (or a prime example of the bargaining stage of grief) to think Gamestop is gonna just become Steam or any completely different company, but it's worth looking at what actually works in the company and what they're doing to expand on that.",1,0,1614832717,melkatron
