1,gpjxfo0,"Think of a gaming table as a seat in a restaurant. Unless that customer is still ordering food/drinks it's time to flip the table. You are advocating for a space where someone can come and hang out for hours on end and simply buy a soda pop, cause they are either 12 or a nerd. It's just not a great business plan. And for that reason.... I'm out",5,0,1614791444,belichickyourballs

3,gpjzqjh,"god dam this is stupid, lol yes lets turn this place into a restaurant lord knows they have great operating margins and aren't money pits lol. All to serve people while they play a game they didn't buy there and will spend no money beyond a minimum.  Please go back to freshman economics and come back when you're not an idiot.",3,0,1614792428,WHOateALLtheASS
4,gpk2r9s,"This is a brilliant idea.  It would be a modern day arcade. I miss the arcades.  I literally borrow my nephew sometimes so we can go to Chuck E Cheeses to play some arcades because they don't allow grown men in without a child.

The idea with the prerelease games is awesome.  I'm always wanting to try the game before buying it even if i have to pay for 10$ to play it for 2 hours just like the theaters.  Maybe 3 hours since some movies are getting to those lengths.

I'm down for this idea!",3,0,1614793711,CloneElites
5,gpk314f,"Ways to improve: to flip the tables more quickly GameStop could focus on brick and mortar game betting. They have different match areas where you go to place bets on matches between your friends or strangers, then play the match right there. GameStop takes 10% profit off each bet.",3,0,1614793828,SoapyStud
6,gpk4r08,This sounds very much like a digital board game cafe... it's a tough business model to make work. That said I also miss the cyber cafe LAN games days and have much more disposable income compared to the 90s.,2,0,1614794561,Vertical_Monkey
7,gpkc369,All the arcades went out of business unless they're selling food and alcohol as well.  You have to offer a unique experience that people can't get at home.,1,0,1614797718,SomeGuyNamedPaul

12,gply7le,"I guess I'm worried that Gamestop will become just another Newegg.com, which would be great, but if it could also become more like Dave N Busters too with game rooms rented by the hour, that could be worthwhile.",1,0,1614825482,OrangePrestigious168
13,gplzyue,Nerds kind of are the primary gaming demographic... so there's that,1,0,1614826343,OrangePrestigious168
