18,gqhnbyb,"There's a short squeeze going on. I am no educated enough about the topic to enlighten you.

There's a bubble happening due to social media and mass hysteria.

There are genuine people who like the stock and want to see GME stick around and pivot into an e-commerce retailer from a standard brick and mortar. (nostalgic idiots)

Basically, from what I can muster and deduce on my own... Hedge funds with BILLIONS in collateral and purchasing capital saw a company on paper (GME) failing, miserably. So to the point, that they were possibly being considered for bankruptcy. Without going into GME's financials, they were going broke and spending a lot more money than they were making. They did show some upside but not much. The only positive that I actually ever saw, was ""online sales increased by abouut 6-8%""... (BUT only in AUS/NZ)... Actual global sales were down. So, hedge funds saw a company that was failing and stepped into to make money off the failure. I. E. Shorting the stock, by betting the stock price will fall. And here is where I get lost, because I don't understand options trading in the slightest. Because I have ZERO clue how you make money on a losing position.

So, short squeeze happens on GME, coupled with a social media mass hysterical drive to save GME from r/WSB and the fellow autists... Add in the whole nostalgia factor... And this is where we're at.

Tried my best. Hope it helps.",1,0,1615408348,gainlong

34,gqhwmgm,"I mean, it's probably psychological. If you think about it, if you have a bunch of ITM calls that are expiring in 2 days, then you would probably want to exercise them early. MMs are also aware of the huge volatility these trades can cause if done on the expiration date, so they probably bought a ton of shares to cover their calls sold, taking the price of the stock up slowly instead of all at once. Then they simply finalized a ton of these sales to the contract holders who have already exercised their options in the past couple days.

So this means that all of that extra push today could've been mostly artificial. I.e. the equilibrium price was never really above $280ish.

Now, I'm assuming that tons of people who have exercised their options and now own hundreds of shares for all these overly inflated meme stocks will be causing a huge drop off in price when they sell, if that weird drop today was the exercising of options that I think it was..",1,0,1615412346,jhuntinator27

44,gqi1i1u,"True. But shorting is very possible too. 

I don‚Äôt know the rules on NYSE but I do know that on the Stockholm NASDAQ exchange you don‚Äôt need to actually borrow a share if you close your short position the same day before market close. 

Assuming the same rules apply at NYSE:

In this situation they were probably confident they could get the market to tank significantly, especially since they most likely preloaded with puts to get a negative gamma squeeze going, that will flood the market with shares, making it easy to buy the shares back and close their position before market close.",1,0,1615414535,knappis
