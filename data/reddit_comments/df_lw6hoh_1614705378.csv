WSB made plays on RKT earnings months ago and on top of that old school WSB members posted DD on RKT just a week ago. Going around calling everything manipulation isn't the way. People need to develop some sort of critical thinking. Anybody with half a brain looking at RKT's earnings and situation will know it's not a pump and dump play.
