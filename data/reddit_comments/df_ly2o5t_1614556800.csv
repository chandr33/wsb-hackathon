1,gq6bucc,"Honestly, if UWMs product is better than rocket, why not let it stand on its own merit? I really donâ€™t get this whole telling customer (brokers) youâ€™re either with us or against us. Wtf kind of strategy is that? It would be like Apple saying we wonâ€™t sell you an iPhone if you also own an Android device. Am I missing something here?",1,0,1615175802,TallyHo17

5,gqal3k8,"So as I was explaining earlier, Rocket will literally steal your clients. So if you're a broker, and you submit a client, John Doe, who wants to purchase a home, and the loan funds, a few months later that client might want to refinance. Say you submit the loan to UWM. When the loan funds and the client gets their mortgage statement, the statement will have the broker's name and contact info printed on the main page in case the client wants to reach out for further business.

Say the client wants to refinance. They call UWM instead of the broker because they don't know better. UWM will refer them back to the broker, then the broker will again shop the client around and submit them to another lender to refinance their loan. It may or may not be UWM once again, depending on the client's story at that time. Maybe another lender has better pricing, who knows.

Now say you submit the loan to Rocket instead. If the client accidentally calls Rocket, they won't waste time and they'll refinance the client through their retail channel instead. So now this client who was originally the broker's client was sniped by the lender.

So what UWM is doing is taking a stance. UWM has been trying to help the broker world since the beginning since they're only a wholesale lender. They could open a retail channel if they wanted to, but they don't because they believe brokers are better. UWM lowering their rates caused the entire competition to lower their rates as well. I've been getting E-mails constantly stating pricing has gotten better with such and such lender. Yes, rates may have slightly gotten better on a federal level, but not as much as they've been getting with the lenders.

So while UWM is making these drastic changes to help brokers, if that broker goes and submits a loan to Rocket, the broker is effectively saying that they don't believe in themselves. Then it goes and hurts other brokers, and so on and so forth.

6,gqal9mn,I wanted to reply to you earlier but I've been so busy. I just replied to somebody up above who asked the exact same question. Sorry man!,1,0,1615263784,DiZzyBonne
7,gqap5zf,Appreciate it! Canâ€™t find it though. Could you reply with my u/ in the thread?,1,0,1615266297,vexednex
8,gqauts6,"Thanks
For tagging me. 
I have to say...I dont buy them doing it to help brokers. Itâ€™s a real bad look for them to make the market less free when they could have said this is whats going on instead...iâ€™m still interested in them because of their wholesale but i dunno how i feel about investing with them morally.",1,0,1615270442,vexednex

10,gqavd8x,"As someone who used to work with both UWM and Rocket, let me tell you that UWM is WAY easier to work with. The underwriters at Rocket don't know what they're doing, nobody ever wants to help, their system is terrible, it's slow, you can't do basic things that you should be able to do, they have a ton of stupid guideline overlays, they default to one underwriting system when there are two and you have to force them to change, and a ton of other things. That's just a small list of many things about them that I, and many others, dislike.

With UWM, we can close our client in as little as 7 days. That would never happen with Rocket. Plus, UWM's customer service is bar none.

Everybody I know who has worked with both prefers UWM. The only reason you'd send a loan to Rocket is because either the client really wants them because they saw them in a commercial, or because their rate was slightly more competitive. But now that UWM is lowering their rates, it shouldn't be an issue anymore.",1,0,1615270892,DiZzyBonne

16,gqem9ta,"An old saying.... ""fortune favors the bold""  


Doesnt apply here, UWM's CEO is a jackass, this move will hurt him.  


RKT is the Chinese  
UWMC is Ted Jones  


  
And that would leave GME/AMC to be Dale/Saul  


  
Extrapolate that as you see fit, but UWM made a move that makes them look super weak, like they cant handle the competition",1,0,1615345180,lolcensored
