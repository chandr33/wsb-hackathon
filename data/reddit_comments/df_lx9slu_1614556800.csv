1,gplt191,Seems to me like a huge unknown and risk with energy companies like this is how they‚Äôll be affected by any changes in how power is bought and/or consumed - biggest being the potential for distributed energy evolving/exploding in the next few years,1,0,1614822929,butteryhippo
2,gpltdr0,They are rate regulated so they receive a set return on their assets for the regulated business. If there is more distributed energy and less people using the regulators will approve higher rates for the remaining customers. Same goes for energy efficiency. Utilities are encouraged to help reduce customer usage through rates. They can always file a rate case if things change.,3,0,1614823104,duck_speaker

6,gply22a,"Exelon is a shitty company, they rely on blackmailing the government with plant closures to secure subsidies from states and bribing officials. And, they just lost $750M during the Texas freeze. 

Exelon is a dinosaur, its an unmanageable mish mash of legacy utilities and outdated facilities. I can personally attest to the fact that the people who work for Exelon are some of the least inspiring people you will meet. It is the textbook definition of mindless corporate bureaucracy. Bottom line is that they can‚Äôt  complete with smaller and leaner independent power producers. The spinoff is a grasp to save itself, and it‚Äôs telling that the stock hasn‚Äôt done much since they announced the spinoff.",1,0,1614825404,limberjim
7,gply9o5,"Corporate tax rate go up, increase revenue requirement, energy efficiency goes up, increase rates per customer, lost a customer, increase for others, hurricane hits, increase rates, you want to use renewables, increase rates, you want to increase interest rates, increase revenue requirement, you increase cost of equity increase revenue requirement. This is the hedge of all hedges. At a minimum cash gang should come here, at least they'll get a dividend higher than their checking account interest.",1,0,1614825510,duck_speaker

11,gpm0a3e,"Point well taken, not sure why you‚Äôre posting on wsb rather than stocks or securityanalysis haha. 

I guess maybe what I was more getting at is things are changing super fast in energy, which classically a slow moving industry. Filing and getting a rate case takes years and years, no? Also genuinely asking: with revenue being based on installed assets, how does inflation and/or more expensive debt affect your projected 20-30 multiple increase? 

Either way, I appreciate the real dd on something besides a short squeeze üëç",3,0,1614826503,butteryhippo
12,gpm2ugk,"Haha no worries and that probably would have been a better place to put this but ah well. 

Rate cases vary in time taken but typically less than a year from filing to final order. Could also be settled or the issue could be decided in a single issue proceeding. For example, many states have allowed establishment of a covid-19 reg asset for things like ppe/increased wages/more unpaid invoices, etc but they will still need to approve the coats for rate making purposes. 

As to your q on inflation/debt/interest rates. The most important formula for a utility is R = O + (V ‚àí D)r.

R is the revenue requirement, O is the operating expenses, V is the value of used and useful plant, D is depreciation and r is the cost of capital. V-D is the rate base on which a profit margin of r may be made. 

r is equal to the cost of capital (debt/equity). So you see as the coat of debt increases so does the revenue requirement, same goes for inflation if costs go up they get passed along and if they are a part of rate base they increase profits. 

Should be noted that in most states the actual electricity/gas is deregulated so that portion is merely passed through as an operating expense, generation would fall in that category, but through their marketer constellation they can sell that power to customers at unregulated rates.",3,0,1614827825,duck_speaker

17,gpnbdih,"That's not correct, a large part their business is in the competitive market.  Exelon has to bid against other power producers and I don't see them successfully competing in the future, which would make their assets virtually useless. 

Anyways see how the stock does when a nuclear generator backup fails again and their is a Fukushima in the Midwest.",2,0,1614862192,limberjim
18,gpnhb34,"Jim, what he said is true for the regulated business which is currently being called RemainCo. The completive unregulated business of the generation and energy marketing is being called SpinCo, which is what you are referring to.


SpinCo will have one of the cleanest and lowest cost fleets to rely on. 
Constellation, the unregulated electricity and gas marketing business has contracts with 75% of the fortune 100 and is one of the most professional in the business. 

I'm not sure why you are so negative about the company. Could you explain?",1,0,1614865713,duck_speaker
19,gpnsq5n,"I'm negative because I don't like the stock for the reasons I outlined above. 

The competitive company, SpinCo, will not be able to compete with the smaller power producers. In addition, the company has significant underlying issues with despicable behavior that presents a major investment risk for limited upside.

21,gpnzo8z,"I'm aware of each of these issues. Com-Ed bribery was an isolated incident, it was a subsidiary, not Exelon. 

As to nuclear being unprofitable, these were two individual plants. The great thing about nuclear is the low marginal cost to produce power around the clock even if the wind doesn't blow or the wind doesn't shine. If nuclear was treated as a renewable energy as hydro/wind/solar/RNG/geothermal, Hydrogen fuel cells are it would be much more profitable. It has zero GHG emissions, if we priced carbon at $30 and methane at $100 per ton Exelon's fleet would be even lower cost compared to competitors. 

Exelon is lobbying for more support for nuclear and they should get it because if we lose these generation assets on the grid it will take massive investment in other renewables to make up the falling off zero carbon energy. 

I can assure you the big guys like Constellation, Direct Energy, WGL, Nextera, UGIES, Talen, Marathon, ENGIE, etc are the dominant players especially for big end users. The little guys fight for scraps from residential and small commercial. But you're entitled to your opinion.",1,0,1614874314,duck_speaker

23,gpo5fgw,"I will let you be your own judge on Exelon's unethical behavior, but it is a liability that all investors should consider.  

I forgot to mention that Exelon was forced to bankrupt 4 plants a few years back. Not a good sign when a company can't be profitable on billions of dollars worth of investment.  I just don't see the case that the spin off will solve Exelon's litany of problem. In other words - the spin off is a symptom not a cure.
