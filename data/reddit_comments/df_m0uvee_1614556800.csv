21,gqa01xx,"My work sent me on a week long programming course for ¬£8k. The course was decent but I learned very little that I didn't already know. Many years before that I spent ¬£30k on university fees for an art degree that I don't even use (I'm now an engineer).

If you've learned a lot about the stock market and capital investment because of this, then think of your losses as a tuition fee for a course that actually benefitted you. People and businesses pay obscene amounts for training that is rubbish, you paid a moderate amount for good, deep value training.

You're 20, you'll have many years to earn back that money and will one day look back at this as the time you learned how to generate future wealth.

If you've already said goodbye to that cash, I'd slap it back on GME and see what happens.",2,0,1615251896,Catch_0x16

26,gqa10pj,"I know. I jumped in late at $320 on the downside, for moral support. I had enough cash to average down to $60 and really didn‚Äôt care if I lost it, so I do get it. Many don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt have that option. 

Not mad at you OP, just wish people wouldn‚Äôt bet more than they can afford.
