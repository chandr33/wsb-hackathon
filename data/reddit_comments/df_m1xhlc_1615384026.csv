3,gqg0jsk,"In theory yes, but realistically I don't think it's going to work in a way anyone is expecting.  


IMO, if the mess is truly wound so tight a squeeze to infinity is possible, the best case scenario is GME is halted, the SEC forces coverage and sale of the stock at a specific price, all of the stock is returned to longs, and Gamestop makes up the difference in short/long positions by issuing new stock (which is then returned to them, so free cash for them).  
The worst case scenario is I get fucked like always.",1,0,1615384029,WillyGeyser
