7,gqfi01r,"dumb question from a retard here: I'm thinking of putting a limit order in on a stock I won't be able to monitor tomorrow due to work.  In premarket it's currently above where I would want to set it.  However, I've noticed that when the market opens, the price will momentarily drop to where it closed at the day before (at least on the display, idk if the actual price drops).  I'm wondering if by setting a limit order above what it will be at that moment of the market opening means that my stock will sell immediately or maybe even at a price below what I'm seeing in premarket.

For example:

Let's say it closed yesterday at $120.  Premarket is showing it around $170.  My limit order is set to sell if it dips below $160.

My question basically is, when the market opens at 9:30 EST, will my stock sell immediately because the price at open will technically still be $120?",1,0,1615369615,Octopus_420

44,gqfi1f6,"So look at Tesla as an example. The people who believe in Tesla long term cheer it every time they issue stock because it gives them that much more capital to succeed. Elon says they may never need debt financing again. 

Did it turn off Tesla car buyers? No even though they also hugely overlap with stock owners. They loved it because it means Tesla can grow and expand even faster and cheaper 

So if the gmetards truly are long term shareholders like they claim then issuing shares and raising capital would be fantastic. 

The problem is most people seem to be playing the squeeze and just fall back on the “long term hold” when they’re bagholding. So those playing the squeeze would be offended",1,0,1615369650,unemployedbull
