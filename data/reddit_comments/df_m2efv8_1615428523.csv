2,gqiswfi,"Learned a lot about myself as an investor today. I‚Äôve been in for about a month and a half and I walk right into some insane black swan event. Before the drop I was ahead, way ahead, all my dumbassed rookie mistakes were erased by the gains and I felt like a shark. Then It happened and a felt like bait. I was about to hit that sell and salvage something, anything, but trading was halted. Something I‚Äôd never seen before either. I came here to see what the apes were ooking about. People posting fast loss porn WAY bigger than mine. And I realized this is the shit where saying ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù really matters. They were saying it so why wasn‚Äôt I? They were losing a hell of a lot more than me. Hell I was still up at the drop. If these apes can hold after losing the cost of a new car, a nice one, then why the fuck and I reaching for the ‚Äúscared bitch‚Äù button?
