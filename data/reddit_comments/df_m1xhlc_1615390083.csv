34,gqgd6fs,"At that point, hope shorter sleep covering and other big money continues to enter as longs. In the grand scheme of thing, we here are making a material difference as far as sentiment and keeping pressure on this thing, but the larger influence has been hedge funds and other big money that have been on our side as buyers. That’s why it’s funny hearing the people here who think we are ‘sticking it to the hedge funds’ or ‘it’s us vs Wall Street.’ When the reality is for every hedge fund losing money on this, there is another hedge fund making that money.

39,gqgd6hs,"More little people that bought low. For a waterfall lots of panic selling would need to happen all at once.

It’s links in a chain, last time the chain wasn’t nearly as long, so a few break and it drops, snd more break, etc.

Those who averaged down and those who bought low made the chain much much longer.

Just like Cuban said, what would really make individual investors dangerous is if they bought again when it was low.

Plus having ridden the first wave and not sold besides just a bit (I panicked slightly when Reddit went dark), we’ve been shaped and molded. Our diamond hands were put under immense pressure and came out that much stronger.",2,0,1615390092,TheBrettFavre4
