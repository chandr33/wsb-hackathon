15,gpocyvu,"So I invested heavily in tech and growth stocks the last 3 years.  TTD, SHOP, ROKU, NVDA, ZM, FVRR. 

I had stocks that were up 200x to 800x. I started taking profits a month ago because as you stated wall street has decided good solid companies that are growing exponentially and blowing their earnings report out of the water are overpriced and 10 year treasury bonds ticked up indicating inflation.  

This is totally insane but because all the mutual funds, hedge funds, and institutional investor all followed each other into energy and manufacturing, tech stocks are now getting bludgeoned.  

They are all betting that covid is over and tech stocks will not continue growing.  They are fucking insane. If you can make money during the pandemic you will make even more when things return to normal. 

My guess is that Wall Street has been investing in the wrong shit last year and is using the inflation worries to shake retail investors out of the market and allow them to pick up bargains on proven winners. 

That's just my take but I have seen so many times an analyst downgrade a company in effect sinking a stock just before earnings come out and then they post killer numbers.

39,gpokgzc,"There are outstanding tech stocks out there.  The companies I listed killed it the last 3 years. The problem is that the market is scared and the price to earnings is overvalued on tech stocks. They will continue to get bludgeoned in the next 2 to 3 weeks maybe longer. I believe they will rebound but personally I am not a buy and hold guy in a bad market.

 Look what institutional investors just did. They sold tech and rebalanced into energy, utilities, consumer staples and communication services. If smart money sells and rebalances we shouldn't be afraid to either.  

I sometimes think all those talking heads saying buy and hold is just a way to get us small fish to hold the bags while they dump all their stocks. You have to be smart about it but shit I was up 800 percent on trade desk.  It's 20 percent down since I sold.  I can buy in if and when volume increases. 

Watch the Wales. When the big boys move go with them.  That's were the tendies are going to be. It doesn't matter that nvidia did 6 billion dollars in business last year and demolished earnings last quarter. The demand for the stock is way down. Why? Cause the institutions aren't feeding there anymore. 

The biggest indicator to tell you if a stock price increase or decrease is real or not is volume traded. If a stock increase or decrease is on way low volume or after hours it means nothing.

48,gpopmjf,"I work for a large corporation. I invested in ZM and FVRR and made a killing last year. I believe heavily in work from home tech. I also know that both technologies are here to stay and will only go up. With that being said I sold both stocks as multi baggers last month.  

It doesn't matter about the fundamentals as much as it is about demand.  The big institutions aren't buying right now and the demand is low so the stocks are tanking despite the incredible earnings reports. Wall Street is rebalancing away from tech and they will pick apart any tech company that is successful on any nit picking reason they can. That's just how it works.  The same people that own the corporations own the media and they use it to cook the books in their favor. 

When the dust clears work from home tech is apart of corporate life forever now.  I use to go to 7 meetings a day.  5 or 6 hours a day in meetings of which about 15 minutes was related to my department.  It was a colossal waste of my time.  Now I attend those meetings from my office or home. 

 I continue doing my work and when it gets to my portion of the meeting I unmute and deliver my report. Then I promptly hit mute and continue working. 

 I get 3 time as much done know. It is 1000 times more efficient. Every one of my bosses and supervisor feel the same way.  I will never ever go back to a 20 minute walk from the production department to the managers office area again as long as I have a say in how my production department is ran.

If I need to leave early and there is a 4pm meeting I take it in the car on the drive home. Nobody minds cause they are in there cars as well. 

Have you ever purchased an office space in New York city for 300 people.  It's pretty fucking expensive. My company sent all managers home for 6 months.  They did their jobs from home on Zoom. Our factory never stopped making widgets and they discovered that they don't actually have to physically come to work more than 3 times a month if that.  

They could even go to their vacation homes in Colorado and work there. The wife and kids love it. The Bosses are happy cause they can actually work more hours with less commute time. When their day is done they are in the location they enjoy most on Mon through Sunday. They use to take a friday flight and only saw wife and kids on the weekends. (True Story).

The 2 million dollar month rent in New York for corporate office space is actually not really needed. You can hire the best of the best out in San Francisco to do the job and you no longer have to buy his house there and find him one in New York. (True Story). 

Life as we know it has changed forever because of Covid. Zoom will own the future but at the moment they are new and gonna take a beating but....... trust me...they will come back..let the dust settle....and the stock drop....then buy the dog shit fuck out of companies like zoom.

Since the M2 velocity is still super shitty, we're actually likely to see the USD rally as the FED keeps buying up bonds and interest rates should fall (also due to the economy/businesses rejecting these higher interest rates). I can see the FED switching to the long end of the curve to also kill the shorts. 

Anyways, I think the narrative of hyper-inflation is just flat wrong and it hasn't been proven with how the current QE operations are going (the FED has even mentioned this in papers and speeches). All these  massive bets on inflation are gonna get wrecked super hard and it's kind of sad and funny to watch.

82,gppc599,"Alright, I'll play devil's advocate.

Gamestop is a game retailer, not directly part of the gaming industry. The videogame industry is continuing to blow up but it's shifting more and more to digital goods.

Gamestop has yet to adapt, or give any long term plans about how it will adapt. None of the current online storefront runners, like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Valve, not Epic have any reason to give Gamestop a place in their ecosystems for no reason. Especially since for Microsoft and Sony, their ecosystem is how they make all the money back from selling consoles at a loss.

Looking at the PC market for example, getting any sort of beachfront in the store market share is brutal. Epic games spent years spending outrageous amounts of money doing things like giving away free games and large discounts to attract users, and they still didn't make more than a scratch until Fortnite came along. Origin and Uplay are both seen as annoyances rather than desirable services.

So given all that, I don't see what gamestop has to offer in the digital marketplace. Forget drive or investment experience or even business sense for a second, because unfortunately those don't mean anything if your company doesn't have anything to offer. The Gaming industry is definitely not going anywhere, but that doesn't mean gamestop won't either.

Plus, RC and crew haven't actually released any sort of plan or direction for the company yet, so as of now it's still just kind of sinking without any future rescue in sight.

That's my devil's advocate opinion for it. There are some points it has in it's favor, but if they try to become a digital game retailer they're going to get destroyed mercilessly imo. They just don't have anything to sell or anything in exchange for one of the current big players to let them have a slice of the market ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",17,0,1614894836,GasolinePizza
