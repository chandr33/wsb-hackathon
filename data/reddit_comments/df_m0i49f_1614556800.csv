1,gq7wmv0,What puts are you buying? I‚Äôm long on UWM and this doesn‚Äôt sound promising.,2,0,1615217666,atomsmotionvoid
2,gq7wqqu,"Interesting that other brokers/folks in the industry have shared opposite experiences working with UWMC. I'd love to know more about the compliance nightmare you called out, mind elaborating?",1,0,1615217717,ItsTheWaxman
3,gq7ww6v,"UWMC‚Äôs ultimatum is actually for the benefit of brokers.  Rocket is actively trying to bypass and cut out brokers, and UWM has said ‚Äúif you deal with rocket, you can‚Äôt deal with us, BUT if you don‚Äôt deal with rocket, you can deal with anyone else other than us.‚Äù  If it‚Äôs a problem for anyone, it‚Äôs a problem for rocket.  The brokers don‚Äôt mind having their choices cut from 75 to 74, but they do mind being cut out entirely.",1,0,1615217785,FlatBrokeEconomist

8,gq7y47t,"This is wrong. There are no companies that can handle volume except UWM and Rocket. If rocket sends an ad to your client they aren‚Äôt doing it specifically to target our clients, they just advertise everywhere. I have 200 lender options and only use those two 99% of the time. Also I have never lost 1 deal to rocket retail, they are way higher priced.",1,0,1615218314,Nothin2Say

10,gq7ydej,"I am an executive at one of UWMs top 3 brokers in the nation. Our company is possibly going to break up through this. And we are one of the biggest. However all of this info is public that I am saying.

Edit: I can‚Äôt elaborate on the compliance part unless it becomes public.",1,0,1615218425,Nothin2Say
11,gq7yj7b,"What you are describing is exactly why I believe UWMC has put themselves in a legally precarious position. While exclusive dealings are perfectly legal, that‚Äôs not what UWMC is doing. They aren‚Äôt saying, ‚Äúyou must work with us, and only us‚Äù. They are saying ‚Äúyou can work with anyone but RKT‚Äù. That is just dripping with anticompetitive intent and serves only to foreclose their largest competitor from the market. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying UWMC is guaranteed to lose a court battle over this, I‚Äôm just saying that the optics are already against them so it could be an uphill and costly battle.",2,0,1615218495,McPowPow

16,gq7yyfk,If this is true it is because 80% of them use UWM as 100% of their business because they were unaware of Quicken wholesale or they are too sloppy to send to Quicken. UWM takes everything. I would be curious of your source or if you work for UWM.,2,0,1615218676,Nothin2Say

19,gq7z68a,I bought 3000 shares a week after IPO but then sold them once this announcement came out. Anti competition goes against the American way and even more so the broker way.,3,0,1615218768,Nothin2Say

23,gq80bw9,"As far as I can tell, this information hasn‚Äôt entered the public domain.

25,gq82g6y,Lol maybe y‚Äôall just need to get better at doing your DD.  There‚Äôs a reason i always list the company hq in my own personal DD writeups.  Local news sometimes has info that isn‚Äôt found by just going to press releases or looking at the yahoo finance news.,2,0,1615220181,FlatBrokeEconomist
26,gq85isy,It's a bold move. I think it's too soon to say who comes out the winner from the situation. If UWMC gains market share at the expense if RKT I mean it was a good move. The only aspect of that I don't like is that it takes away a major option from brokers who are suppose to get a good deal for there customers. Typically the customers arnt going to have visibility to this type of deal so it probably won't matter. If I was rocket I'd try to spam the message that it undercuts the customers so it appears high up in search results. Or buy ads for certain search terms that points to website painting these facts as negative.,1,0,1615221493,brainal46

29,gq8gnw8,"So brokers are okay with their customers getting poached?  UWMC has the moral high ground here...they work with brokers exclusively while RKT has been caught poaching from brokers using their retail operation.  UWMC CEO has been consistent in fighting against this unethical behavior for years and it's guaranteed brokers side with UWMC here as their interests are totally aligned.
