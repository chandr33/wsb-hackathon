0,gpgzbzb,Didn't Zynga get bought by FB a few years ago? Maybe I'm completely imagining that.,0,0,1614726387,AdequatelySupervised
1,gpgzi6k,Nah. They were struggling a few years ago but theyâ€™ve had a fantastic turnaround,2,0,1614726473,JumbleOfRocks
2,gpgzmm2,Nope. The 2 Marks hate each other. Zynga is totally separate. I bought some stock in it a while back and it is slowly growing.  Slow but steady.,3,0,1614726535,MGaCici
3,gpgzo8w,I feel like apple wonâ€™t try and diversify as the want to stay close to their roots.,1,0,1614726556,skrrrrrttttthdbdb
4,gph069n,"Doesnâ€™t Facebook basically control Zynga though, in a master/sub type of way?",1,0,1614726806,BOOFIN_FART_TRIANGLE
5,gph06rq,"Huh. Man, I totally thought for *years* they were owned by them for some reason.",1,0,1614726812,AdequatelySupervised
6,gph08vu,Wonder why I thought they got bought. Crazy brain I guess,1,0,1614726843,AdequatelySupervised
7,gph09y6,"Zynga seems to have had solid fundamentals for a while now, but IDK what can make it move at this point.  Not a huge fan of sitting around and waiting for an acquisition, especially as better devs become more entrenched in the mobile industry.  I think itâ€™s safe because people are always going to play Words with Friends, but that isnâ€™t the sort of game that can move Apple TV units.",2,0,1614726858,Outrageous-Win-9449
8,gph0gx4,Lol the most popular free stock on Robinhood ðŸ˜‚,-1,0,1614726953,bunkdontmakemefunk
9,gph0tiq,"Balls deep in Jan 2022 17C leaps. I have a feeling this will be their breakout year, looks like they're in a good, consolidated position with their new acquisitions and with that pile of cash looking for even more things to shop.

VR is going to disrupt the industry. I just really hope they'll be positioned for a good head start.",2,0,1614727130,BarTendiesss
10,gph17ex,"Most likely because Zynga poker was a big thing on FB, same as FarmVille I guess. Everybody and their mom (especially their mom) were playing Zynga games on FB at some point.",2,0,1614727326,BarTendiesss
11,gph1b0r,"You're laughing now, but not too long ago Robinhood was offering free GME shares. Make of that what you want.",7,0,1614727377,BarTendiesss
12,gph22jb,The solid fundamentals is why I like it. Itâ€™s a solid bet in general with a reasonable chance of an extraordinary outcome,1,0,1614727763,JumbleOfRocks
13,gph27ni,I thought that was on game stops hit list of potential buy,1,0,1614727835,tazman1024
14,gph2pld,Ah yeah probably cuz of the association,1,0,1614728091,AdequatelySupervised
15,gph3hjf,It very well could be- wasnâ€™t this recent round of GME mania fueled by the idea of a turnaround plan and the people to do it? I could see it,1,0,1614728491,JumbleOfRocks
16,gph3ysn,"Itâ€™s not terrible TBH, and itâ€™s actually stacked up against SPY a bit better than I thought.  Also just looked into it and found that theyâ€™re planning on releasing a Star Wars F2P game on the Switch.  If they can get outside their comfort zone and deliver on those sorts of games, then it has a lot more promise than the last time I looked into it.",2,0,1614728737,Outrageous-Win-9449
17,gph7tdk,"Nah. Very, very common thought.",2,0,1614730706,MGaCici
18,gphwizd,I bought 100 shares when it was under 11. I'm with you I think Zynga is a good company. They have a formula that works well and app games aren't going anywhere. Love the market space and trust the leadership even if they don't get bought out.,4,0,1614743482,knight4
