71,gqiw2ap,"An article about the crash was posted in marketwatch before it happened, waybackmachine doesn't have snapshots since the moment it happened to the rest of the day (very different to rest of days, impossible it's a coincidence IMO), means they at marketwatch disabled permissions for the crawler as soon as they noticed. In other words, I'm convinced the price drop was caused by HFs by slowly buying and selling today at noon. They predicted it would go down by 1/3, so I give it an error of 20 dollars (or they would've said it went down 1/2 or 1/4). It dropped as hard as they expected, but didn't stay that low for too long. Maybe they wanted the drop to be permanent by changing this into a bear market like in January, however there were just 3 dips today under 230 and we closed barely making it, IMHO. There are people saying this could be from our allies to activate the SSR for tomorrow but that doesn't really explain the news coming out early. If it was the hedgies and their intention wasn't a drop like in January... I've no idea.",9,0,1615430248,_Zetto
