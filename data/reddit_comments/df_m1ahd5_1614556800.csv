2,gqcim36,"well, it's prob no secret GME will have to eventually come down to a more ""reasonable"" valuation - the only question is when; i mean look at TSLA - been staying in ""overvalued"" (by some opinion) land for months and who know when/if will come down not to mention maybe even continue rallying before it ""settles""...",1,0,1615308923,greenday10Dsurfer

6,gqcjluw,"Sure, but were talking 10s of thousands of contracts, its very likely not going to hit $5 or $10 by next month. 30k open contracts at $10 are currently worth about $400k. That's potentially low risk money for people selling those contracts.",1,0,1615309290,Darth_Chef

9,gqckl5w,"Honestly the picture here is that there are a shit ton of idiots out there buying puts at extremely low strikes.  Hopefully it isn't the retards on here.  Hopefully the retards on here are the ones selling the puts that low, and making bank off the premiums. 

I'm still holding my 8 shares @59 but if I were the type to bet against (hell fucking no I'm not) I wouldn't buy a put for any strike less than 100 right now.",2,0,1615309721,TexanToTheSoul

12,gqcmh5v,"Now I was looking at this graph, for bearish trades by expiration..... 

https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/gme

To me it does look like all the options trades fade off until May, but smooth brain not understand...

It seems like everyone is taking a break until May?  Like March 19th hits and then nothing until May 1st...like the entire market takes a break for taxes due?

I have no options, just holding GME, I know nothing.  Just like learning.",2,0,1615310548,555-Rally

14,gqcq46i,"It isn't necessary for price to drop to extreme lows for these put contracts' holders to make money. During sharp decrease, let's say 250$ -&gt; 150$, a person who bought put for 1$ could sell it for 10$ making a profit. Though, that means someone else holds the put bag.",0,0,1615312134,RetardStockBot

18,gqcysw4,"Honestly whatâ€™s the point of buying an OTM put with an almost impossible strike price? I donâ€™t get it. 

Even if the price does drop $100, what are the chances someoneâ€™s going to buy that contract from you?",2,0,1615316168,STONKZgodownonme
19,gqczk93,"My smooth brain sees the same, although it may simply be attributed to monthlies, quarterlies, and annuals getting more attention.

It could be interesting if we see the peak at the end of this week/early next week and then a slow drive back down and then a wave back up in April. Because it's so juicy in all directions, people are being encouraged to play it over and over and over again.",1,0,1615316510,scbtl

25,gqe4pp0,"yes.

This is a way for a short seller to get the market maker to sell shares for him, transferring problems onto the market maker.",2,0,1615335774,ferrellhamster
26,gqe5jpr,fear in the market is tremendous sell motivator - lot's of tech lost double digits percentages b/w last week n Monday; however it appears the exuberance (whether rational or otherwise) is back for now....,1,0,1615336217,greenday10Dsurfer
27,gqekfyk,"Yep, sold a $20 put contract for $1.10 ($110) 38 dte, and will probably sell a cheaper weekly. The only real issue is whether I exit at 50% profit to free up buying power or just wait until expiration.",1,0,1615344183,CraigWesleySF

30,gqelt0k,"Thatâ€™s why the market works, everyone is free to make their own decision and we need people to take opposing trades. Iâ€™m comfortable selling puts at $20-80 strikes to collect premium and would actually love to be assigned shares at those strikes. But for me to do that, I need someone to make the opposite trade who thinks Iâ€™m an idiot and pay me for that contract. Even though, literally at the time of buying, there are probabilities for being itm, otm, and touch, which would say my probability of profit is greater.",1,0,1615344920,CraigWesleySF
