15,gqeqcb3,"Here‚Äôs some DD for y‚Äôall.

This rise is far greater than what preceded it in January.

Exhibit A: The rise before the rise.

Back on Jan 12, GME closed at 19.95. Over a quick, two day process, GME skyrocketed 100% to close at 39.91 on Jan 14. A gain of 19.96 dollars. 

Then, on Feb 23, after the first part of our saga, GME closed at a measly 44.97. Over the next two days, GME rocketed upwards, closing Feb 25 at 108.73. A rise of 142% or 63.76 dollars.

Exhibit B: The slow climb

Between Jan 14 and Jan 25, GME slowly rose from 39.91 to 76.79 a share. The climb was fairly slow, but ended up as a 92% gain, equivalent to 36.88 dollars a share.

Between Feb 25 and Mar 9, though, GME also had a slow but steady rise. The stock rose from 108.73 on Feb 25 to 246.90 on Mar 9. A gain of 138.17 dollars or a 227% gain. 

Exhibit C: The spike

We haven‚Äôt seen the spike for our second saga yet. But for the first, we saw it spike from 76.79 to 347.51 a share between Jan 25 and Jan 27. A gain of 270.72 dollars or a gain of about 353%.

Exhibit D: The Math

In Exhibit A, we saw that GME increased 19.96 dollars a share in the rise before the rise, but rose 63.76 in the second saga rise before the rise. Therefore, the second saga rise before the rise was 319% the size, or 3.19 times bigger, than the one of the first saga.

In Exhibit B, the slow climb, we saw the first saga climb 36.88 dollars a share, while the second saga climbed 138.17 dollars a share. Therefore, the second saga slow climb was about 375% what the first saga slow climb was, or about 3.75x bigger.

In Exhibit C, we saw the first saga spike was of 270.72 dollars a share, but don‚Äôt have spike data for the second saga.

Exhibit E: The Grand Reveal

So, on average, the second saga‚Äôs rise has been around 3.47x bigger than the rise of the first saga. As a result, we‚Äôll use that number for our spike calculations.

The first spike saw GME spike 270.72 a share in 2 days. Multiplying that number by how much greater than the second saga is than the first (3.47x), we get that GME should roughly reach 939.40 dollars a share in the coming spike.

Exhibit F: This May Be Too Conservative

And this may be a conservative estimate. GME was in the 400s early on the day of Jan 28, and even reached 530 that premarket. That rally, which as pointed out, pales in comparison to what we have going here, probably had the steam to reach 1000 a share. 

Then, you know what happened. Robinhood halted trading, and GME plummeted under 200 a share. 

Now though, we already have a much bigger rally, and GME may not fall victim to the corrupt CEO of a formerly well-respected broker app. 

And so who knows. 1K certainly isn‚Äôt a meme. 1K will be upon us soon. And 1K is the first of many places we will wind up.",26,1,1615347501,XAfricaSaltX
