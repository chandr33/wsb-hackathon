7,gpgb0xl,It' not planning for failure at all - It's a hedge against your longs - it's called portfolio protection. if you are not familiar - https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/5-portfolio-protection-strategies.asp,2,0,1614715591,Stockrunning

15,gpgoi53,"Worthless as protection.

First of all the profit range is too narrow. 

Second, the profit range is different (BE-points and amount of profit) in case a bearish move happens well before expiration.

Third, do you know the beta value of your stocks?",1,0,1614721335,USoccerMovesCol
16,gpgpwn1,"Untrue - First you would be up 35% if the fall happened tomorrow and at 370, and 1000% if happens to stay at 370 in September. This is a 40 dollar wide spy put fly - which represents a 5% pullback from a 390 spy position. 

It is not a full hedge on an entire portfolio and I'm not trying to short the SPY. I am not trying to pump and dump. Most people who are trading based on Reddit may only know how to be long. I am showing a way to keep costs low while maintaining their long portfolio. Maybe this is not right for you... but when the market falls, this becomes a very profitable trade!",1,0,1614721946,Stockrunning

23,gph2ytp,"Even if the S&amp;P drops to 3700 tomorrow, the spread would have to open up first to be profitable. Chances are the volatility pushes this forward.

Second, a hedge with the S&amp;P doesn't cut it when ones portfolio is topped up with meme stocks.

Third, a 35% increase 'tomorrow' may sound great (but see my remark about the volatility closing the profit window temporarily), but this is 35% relative to this particular position, not the portfolio.

If the hedge takes as much guessing to how much it ideally should retrace and by which time frame, it's no hedge at all.

Edit: I didn't mean to be blunt. I just visit the sub only sporadically. It's good to see someone overthinking things than just YOLO and to-da-moon. :-)",1,0,1614728222,USoccerMovesCol
