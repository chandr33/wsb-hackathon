6,gqde44s,Shares holding for long term I think it's 60~ by EoY which is 50% upside. Calls I'm not sure. Tomorrows market is going to be determined based on the CPI numbers and 10y auction in the afternoon.  So even if they crush tonight we might see some of their upper end capped because of broad market issues.  So it really depends.  I will likely sell off over a period of days and will keep my longer term calls through the week to see how analysts react.,3,0,1615323053,sleepysol

15,gqg7lmu,"Oh shit, just featured on CNBC.  CEO coming on a little later.  Gonna rocket up then crash back down below $38 if it's like every other CNBC stock",1,0,1615387612,MortalDanger00
16,gqg7ylx,Na it's support is about 38.  It needed to break 37.8 yesterday and it did.  There's very little sell side pressure now until 40.,1,0,1615387776,sleepysol
17,gqg8c1v,"I've been in BB, GME, RKT, SNDL, TLRY, and APHA.  Sold most at the top.  Once a reddit hits CNBC it rockets up then way back down, then settles on a new, higher, low.  But in this case, I think you're right.  It's not been a huge reddit stock.",1,0,1615387948,MortalDanger00
