1,gqc1b5d,Wanna just shoot me a message when to buy and what our exit is?   I'll send you a care package.,2,0,1615302335,M4RKeM4RK
2,gqc1nre,Create an account on TradingView if you don't have one and you can set alerts at a certain price,1,0,1615302480,MoistBands
3,gqc1ows,I am a bot. This Chart does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615302494,VisualMod
4,gqc2dad,Well I would but the Bot Mod already deleted it so I can't go look at the specific price.  I will make a trading view account though.  The Yahoo alerts always get buried by my phone for some reason.  I can't get them to actually make noise or vibrate or something.  Anyways have a good one!,2,0,1615302771,M4RKeM4RK
5,gqc2glr,You as well! Hope you figure things out,1,0,1615302809,MoistBands
