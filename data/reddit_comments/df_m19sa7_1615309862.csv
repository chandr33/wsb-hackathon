1,gqcl3rx,"&gt; A part of me thinks shorts know the government can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt let them fail so they are going to keep doing what they‚Äôre doing.

It's not a matter of ""can't,"" they're literal parasites that contribute no utility to the economy.  They may well be bribing people, but literally the whole nation improves if they go under.

You may be missing the bigger play: they could be trying to make such a clusterfuck if they lose that it will provide incentive to bail them out in the realm of ""if I'm going down I'm taking you all with me.""

21,gqcmija,"&gt; They will be bailed out if people's pensions are gone. My pension is invested with a hedge fund as are most

This is a problem to take up with your pension program. If you're engaged with a hedge fund that's engaged in extremely risky behavior it's because you want the insane potential benefits. If you were getting those benefits you can't be upset that you now get the impact of the risks. There are plenty of safer options than shorting stock.

As for whether Congress will bail out hedge funds, I think if something happens this year where they need to be bailed out and Congress moves to do so it's going to decimate their chances to relate to people in the midterms. They're struggling to get out stimulus checks and other aid to people, turning around and supporting corporations won't play well at all.",5,0,1615310564,Belazriel
