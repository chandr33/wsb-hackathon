40,gpnqop8,"TOO WHOM MAY APPLY:
Today we want atleast 10% drop in GME to unlock the SSR RULE. What does that mean for you scrubs? It means if it drops lower than 10% from initial starting price of the day this tule is applied for the next trading day. The rule itself prevents short sellers from knicking and trashing down the price of GME. INSTEAD short sellers have to sell at a UP-TICK RULE. It means that short sellers can only sell for higher prices the next day. And with next day being Friday, a beautiful day for options coming due, we may have the perfect storm for another ride. 

So moral of the story for you scrubs that are new to this, don‚Äôt panic because this is kind of what you want.

Don‚Äôt believe me google SSR rule for stonks on google
 
EDIT: DONT SELL YOU SMOOTH BRAINS shorting headgefunds will drop that price for us, they don‚Äôt need your help wtf is wrong with all of you, do you actively hate money?

Edit: to be clear it has to drop from 10% from yesterday‚Äôs closing price (excluding after market and pre market this morning)
