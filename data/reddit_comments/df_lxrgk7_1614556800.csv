Which direction they are going!
There's no knowing where they're rowing,
Or which way they river's flowing!
Not a speck of light is showing,
So the danger must be growing,
For the rowers keep on rowing,
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing...

HF Fucks they be groaning
for GME shows no sign of slowing

It makes so much sense when you think about it. 

All of the other spoiled brats (🧻🤲) forfeited their gobstoppers (shares) along the way for what was probably peanuts compared to what they could have had if they had done what they were supposed to. But Charlie (💎🙌) held onto his faithfully right up until the moment of truth.

**Charlie/💎🙌:** Mr. Wonka. (*gently sets down gobstopper on desk before walking away*)

**Wonka/DFV:** So shines a good [ape] in a weary [market]...

**Wonka/DFV:** Charlie! (*smiles warmly*) My [retard].. You won! YOU DID IT! You did it! I knew you would, I just knew you would!
