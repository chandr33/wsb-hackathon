**WTI** \-- the ETF, it went up almost 6%, I have a big position already but I added today right at the bell.

**OVTZ** \-- This stock has been good to me, it has a huge short position on it but I keep buying and buying. I'm considering adding another 100 shares after the 10, 000 I bought yesterday.

**TSLA** \-- I'm *considering* buying puts @ Sept 17, 2021 strike at $520. 

**SESN** \-- a pharma stock that I bought at 0.80. It has a priority FDA review for a bladder cancer treatment in talks right now. Hoping it gets approved and then has intercourse with your mom.

62,gpkza0v,"I think the 14k -&gt; 12k pullback will dampen the bubble fears a bit. Tech is posting strongest-ever earnings and cash flow.

I mean, I don't like TSLA at all, but if it hits 500? It'll be at the 200 day SMA and down 40%. I'd even have to take a look there, tech will start to look like a deal.

IMO the Fed isn't going to let interest rates get out of control here, there's fear in the market on inflation, but the broad economy and prices are still running at 2019 levels. I think the rate/inflation fears are a couple years too early at this point, that's a 2022 post-COVID problem.",1,0,1614807768,notsofst
