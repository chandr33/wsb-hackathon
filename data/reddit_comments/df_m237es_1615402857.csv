70,gqhaerx,"after that dip... if you zoom out to 3M (or 6M, depending where you're viewing your charts from) look at the pattern the line takes in January.

There's the baseline, a small bump up followed by a tiny dip then another tiny bump. After that it raises pretty high and curves gradually to the right before shooting straight up to peak.

Now look at this month's action. It's pretty much the exact same movements, only amplified to a ridiculous amount. Which means, after maybe a day or two of 10% gains or mostly sideways movement, it will rocket up like crazy. Assuming it follows the pattern from January.",1,0,1615402871,MonsiuerGeneral
