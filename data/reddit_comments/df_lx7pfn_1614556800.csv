I mean ""sports book"" because I think that'll be where the hay is made rather than their subscription service. So I'll follow up when they announce more.

45,gpnm5lx,"Couple of things... 1. This is a high growth company. Obviously cash is important, but their spend got them customers and last year they proved they can retain customers, even without sports. Netflix, Roku and even Telsa all had wild EPS misses in their early stages. Investing in FUBO is risky and Iâ€™m not saying FUBO is the new Tesla. Iâ€™m just saying missing EPS when over delivering every KPI is a beat in earnings. Diluted EPS was closer to -$1.50. Still a large miss but not half as bad. People converted their debt into shares during Q4. Meaning Fubo had the cash to spend (increase in expense) but the denominator of the EPS calculation was too low because the debt wasnâ€™t converted until later in the quarter. 2. FuboTVâ€™s sportsbook isnâ€™t live until Q4 2021.",3,0,1614868224,VersaceSauce123
