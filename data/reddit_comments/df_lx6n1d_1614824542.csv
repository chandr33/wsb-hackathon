17,gplx0nj,"1.  It's not even ITM vs OTM.  Both legs could be ITM.

I could have a 10/20 vertical.  And you could have a 20/30 vertical.  And someone else could have a 30/40 vertical.  etc etc.  And when they get exercised all these contacts are going to be satisfied with one lot of shares being passed down a chain (and some cash being passed around).  So even though it looks like tons of open interest if you add them all up, it only requires 100 shares to satisfy.

2.  The original borrower is still a long position.  They lent them out but they own them.  They can sell them at any time, with no notice.  They can write calls against them.

Also I think you said something about gamma increasing closer to strike prices.  That's just wrong.  Gamma is just the 2nd derivative of premium wrt underlying price.  It should be a smooth curve.

Also a gamma squeeze is not caused by options being exercised.  It's caused by the underlying increasing in price before the options expire or are exercised.  Once they have been exercised the option position is closed and there is no gamma (an all-stock position has 0 gamma because delta is constant wrt price -- it's the size of the position)",8,0,1614824897,Keith_13

Last year at @5$ a share with 70shares the market cap was $350 million, right now at $120$ the market cap is $8.4 billion.

Cause of this market cap it has to be reclassified accordingly in the Russell index. 
According to uncle Bruce, any ETF that is mirroring the performance must buy GameStop shares. It has to sell stock of the company dumped of the index and buy GameStop. Higher the GameStop stock value, it will be higher in the Russell index.

Higher up on the index, these index funds will have to buy more shares of GameStop to reflect the power of the stock inside the index.

These revision in the index can be quarterly, biannually or yearly.
