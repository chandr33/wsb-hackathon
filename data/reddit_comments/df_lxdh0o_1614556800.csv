3,gpmh7tw,"I‚Äôm curious, what‚Äôs your take on mobile gaming then? I personally think mobile gaming is going to continue to grow and take a sizable share of the gaming space. [This article from TC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/mobile-gaming-mints-money/amp/) says mobile gaming has taken 45% of the gaming space. 

Also, they‚Äôre expanding into PC and cross-platform gaming.",3,0,1614836299,heyzeuzz

12,gpmibkt,"IV on $znga is very low, FDs are cheap - even for share prices that on Monday were normal.

I have:
  12 x 12$ march 5 call
   12 x 11.50$ march 4 call
   2 x 11$ march 5 call

started with just the 2 ar 12$ strike but loaded up every time it went out of the money + loaded down, because these FDs are daaaamn cheap, and I was hoping for a TMT conference catalyst (meant to watch this morning, if I saw that aquisition was announced I would have loaded up)

if I was a financial advisor I might advise people to grab a couple ITM calls, 5x more OTM before the IV goes up and just wait for tech reversal to end!

I'm super bullish on these guys, I've been watching them since November and kept missing entry points thinking they would stop, but they never stop.",7,0,1614837086,Dorktastical
13,gpmikdz,Your reasoning with regards to the low IV is exactly why I bought more. I also think it‚Äôll see a nice lift when tech reversal ends üëç,6,0,1614837267,heyzeuzz

32,gpnqbst,"Echtra has proven they cant re-create what someone else created that they were a part of (SOME, not all were a part of Diablo, and again, only a part). They just can't. Heck, with Torchlight 3 they even resorted to false advertising. They advertised their game as massively multiplayer when it could only have 18 players together at once. They then retracted that (as if it was ever going to be one lol) and the game bombed anyway.

As a gamer, its not a good purchase and no on ecares.",1,0,1614870197,HoboBandit82
