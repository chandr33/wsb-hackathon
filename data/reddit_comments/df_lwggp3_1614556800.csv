66,gphrt5x,"So, I'll break it down quickly as best as I can, but you should absolutely do research and learn from someone who knows a lot more. 

You buy a call option on a 30 dollar stock. The option is 5 mar 21, or March 5th 2021. Your strike price you chose to purchase at is $35. The options writers value this contract at $.75 per share. This means you'll pay the premium of $.75 per share, for 100 shares. The premium here is literally just what you pay to buy the contract. After that, you will have the option to exercise the contract. Exercising the contract is buying the allocated shares at your strike price, which in this case is $35. You would need to pay $3,500 to exercise that specific call option. You could also choose to sell the call option at its current value. Most normies won't ever exercise a call option, but will sell the option to someone who has the capital to exercise it. 

Why would anyone buy it and why wouldn't you exercise?

Exercising a contract always means filling the option at 100 shares. For new or casual traders this just means a big investment into a liquid asset. If people are especially bullish, they may do that. Fortunately, let's say that the stock is worth $40 on the day of expiration. That means that someone with money to burn would be happy to buy your call option for more than you paid. They're able to buy your option, exercise it, and instantly sell the shares for a $5 x 100 profit, or purchase a rising stock for under current share price. You'll make a good chuck of change simply for the inherit risk of buying and holding that option, and the profit will be directly correlated to how much the current share price is over your contracts strike price.",12,0,1614740971,MyOtherDogsMyWife
