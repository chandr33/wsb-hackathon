9,gqi4nfs,500+ pretty doable by Friday.,4,0,1615416029,indyyo1
10,gqi50ad,"I totally understand....I put $5,000 on a call as well. I was up late last night with my son, as he wasn’t feeling good. I was up about $1,000, and laid down for a nap. In the course of that 45 minutes, I was up $20,000 at one point, which would have been some great college fund tendies for him, and before I even woke up was already down $1,000. Sigh. Such is the roller coaster. But I think betting odds on GME is equally good mojo as buying calls.",1,0,1615416202,Bright_Earth_8282

13,gqi8w8b,Congrats. But you are missing the point. It's not about being ashamed about taking profits. It's about how much profit you want to take.,1,0,1615418116,myuserid4
14,gqi9liq,"I didn’t miss the point, they still made a profit.. 5k towards student loans is still helpful. Yeah it’s not 30k but we can’t all be jackpot winners",4,0,1615418467,Wienerdawgy
15,gqibazi,"Yeah, at this point maybe we just grab some shares if anything. Calls are now crazy expensive, even the 800 strike.",2,0,1615419331,phillythompson
16,gqic3f2,"Exactly. Will I be bummed if it shoots to 500+ on Friday? Of course -- but the calls could also expire worthless, too.    


I'd be ecstatic to make 5K in a day on any other day. So, I can't let the ""what could've been"" eat me up",5,0,1615419740,phillythompson

21,gqiq1lg,Sounds gay. I bought 2k worth of calls on Monday and turned it into 20k at peak today.,3,0,1615427110,Sweatingtoomuch
22,gqjjgzb,Options give you the right to buy 100 shares for a certain strike price by a certain date. They're more complicated and never sell a call or a put unless you have 100 shares to back it up.,1,0,1615444099,Dork_1557
23,gqkcq5t,"&gt;never sell a call or a put unless you have 100 shares to back it up.

ELI5?

From my understanding, you do not sell a call option and have a responsibility to provide any shares, you're selling a contract you purchased that would've entitled you to 100 shares at X price, not that you are creating a contract for your own 100 shares.",1,0,1615464742,FrankieSaints
24,gqkqixg,You can buy or sell a call or put option.,1,0,1615473065,Dork_1557
25,gqkrozg,"Right, but you say you must have 100 shares to back it up, what do you mean by this? Goes against everything I know about calls. You don't provide 100 shares, you have the option to BUY 100 shares if you so choose to exercise the option.

1. Share Price &lt; Call = Expires Worthless
2. Share Price &gt; Call, before expiration
2.a. Sell Option aka Sell To Close, that's it. You paid for a contract, you sold contract &gt; original cost
2.b. Exercise Option, you buy the shares (100) at the contract price, do whatever you want with the shares
3. Share Price &gt; Call, expires, some platforms will automatically exercise these options, basically buy them for you, whether that's on margin or liquidating other positions, otherwise you basically do the same as 2.b.

Where, in there, must I have 100 shares??? Care to explain why buying a call means I should have shares to back it???",1,0,1615473644,FrankieSaints
26,gqkz9ts,"You don't need 100 shares at all. If you sell a call or a put, I recommend you have 100 shares for each one you sell in case the price turns against you. Or else you end up like the shorts with GME.",1,0,1615477149,Dork_1557
27,gql9qfo,"This is such a strange concept.

You buy call, price goes up, you sell call, make profit. That's it. No need for 100 shares of anything...?",1,0,1615481794,FrankieSaints
