5,gqicdyn,"Price volatility in AH is crazy due to super low volume. Most retail traders donâ€™t trade in after hours, so itâ€™s the big boys with big money doing the trading. Because of the really low volume, prices swings can be huge. Thatâ€™s why if you ever work with a brokerage that allows you to trade AH, they warn you about the crazy volatility before you make a trade.",2,0,1615419894,Saxamaphooone

I think there will probably be another short attack on Friday after the SSR lets up. There are currently 150k Shares available to short according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). We will probably spend all day tomorrow climbing back to 300, maybe 320, but if we breach the $340 threshold on Friday... they are going to try to keep us down in hopes of preventing a massive Gamma Squeeze.

Until then, I will be patiently waiting with funds to buy the dip :) Thanks and fuck you Hedgies",21,0,1615420114,ohWombats
