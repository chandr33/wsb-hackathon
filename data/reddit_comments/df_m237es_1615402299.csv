Only you can make that decision, and when you do make it, know that one way or another when this is all over there's gonna be big winners and big losers. Are you prepared to lose every penny? Because more often than not that's what happens.  MAYBE it'll be different this time, but the market is designed to take money from dumb people.  I was dumb once and lost 60k on a sure thing because I was holding out for 100k.  After that happened I shrugged and moved on with my life, because I felt the risk I was taking was worth it.  Can you do the same if your entire account disappears?  If not, there is no price target low or high enough for you.
