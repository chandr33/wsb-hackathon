Should we invest in a producer/refiner or should we pick a company that does one aspect only.  

*For the chalk eaters: producers pull oil out of the ground and sell it to refiners.  Refiners then sell that product.  Traditionally high oil prices may mean more for producers since they get that profit but refiners pay more for their oil.",1,0,1614813733,JayArlington

41,gplvl87,"I‚Äôd see how much of each company‚Äôs production was in fracking oil and how many of their wells they had to shut down during the initial lockdowns. Some of these oil companies leveraged through the roof during the fracking gold rush. The slow down in fracking is precisely why oil is rising. Fracking accounted for half of the domestic oil output.

The only ""mistake"" I made in May was buying Southwest. Otherwise, I bought oil stocks and forgot about them while you WSB people panicked and stressed out over shitty pump and dump stocks from lame joke companies like GME or AMC. Seriously? Theaters and game retailer? Invest in real shit like heavy industry, tech, or aerospace. Fuck outta here with that joke investing.
