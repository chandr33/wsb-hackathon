0,gpg79a4,Yeah. They halt when it is too volatile. Fuck the retail investor.,3,0,1614713971,CashTotal
1,gpg79v0,I think it dropped 10% in 5 mins? So breaker is automatically triggered,2,0,1614713978,BeNiceDontBeMean
2,gpg7bb6,Its called a halt. They do this due to volatility.,1,0,1614713995,russellups
3,gpg7dnw,Yes it is,1,0,1614714022,cooldaniel6

5,gpg7f9k,Personally that’s when I pick up more burgers because this is Good Burger home of the Good Burger,3,0,1614714041,tonystarks6969
6,gpg7jfd,It halted because of volatility and when it drops like that probably halted due to a big sell off. Has to adjust,1,0,1614714091,Clint-O-Bean
7,gpg7ktg,I believe if it rises or drops 10% in 5 minutes it’s halted. I’m just a ape in a casino though don’t know the rules just keep rolling the dice.,1,0,1614714107,Artemis611
8,gpg7mr5,"I always seen the stock price drop after it returns , never seen it go up when suspended!",1,0,1614714131,kato1226
9,gpg7pjm,"But volitlity is lower than GMEs has been gme @ around 470% and around 300% for RKT... Noticed that halt.. thought it was my apps doing a hiccup or something. 

Also volume today is crushing the average of 17 mil with 252mil today",1,0,1614714166,Tonemarley23
10,gpg7qhf,"Kind of the opposite, it's illegal NOT to halt the stock temporarily.   


There's a thing call LULD circuit breakers, basically too much volatility up or down will trigger a halt of a few minutes and resume trading.   


As of 2012 they must have that system in place.",2,0,1614714177,EnderSword
11,gpg85hu,"Thanks definitely didn't know about LULD CBs  makes some sense.. but why is it there to limit volitlity? What happens.. if left unchecked? Rich shorting bitches go broke or what? Cause it seems that's the only people it's helping lately

Sure as shit halted my path to my 50 call real quick... But it's only a speed bump.. I don't think they can stop this train now",1,0,1614714359,Tonemarley23
12,gpg8ah9,"It's not a volatility number, its a price band thing, it happens when you get into a thin order book.   


Like if I went to a stock and just said 'buy 10 million shares at market' at first I'd get 66.10.... 66.11....66.12....66.13.....66.20...66.25.....66.40.....67.....68.....69......75.....82....99.....150...  


It's to stop market orders, HFTs and other things from just ripping through the order book faster than anyone can respond.",1,0,1614714419,EnderSword
13,gpg8dzb,Gotcha.. that makes a lot more sense.. thank you,1,0,1614714461,Tonemarley23
14,gpg8kof,So today with RKT surging over 50-60 percent so quickly  on over 252 mil volume compared to 17 mil average.. the system just can't keep up.. if I'm understanding you.,1,0,1614714542,Tonemarley23
15,gpgarbr,"A lot of it is to stop Flash Crashes and panics. 

There have been instances where someone has simply added a zero to an order or a trading algorithm does something unexpected. 

I know people love this insane conspiracy theory narrative, but the simple fact is the LULD has triggered on GME 55 times in the past 2 months... 43 of those times it was halts a crash, not a rise.

What happens is you burn through the order book and no one has a chance to respond. There's always a cluster or orders around the current price, but if someone puts in a big order right away, they can use up all those shares faster than people can place new orders and either sky rocket or crash the price. 
Then inevitably the market will correct back seconds or minutes later. The circuit breakers stop that from happening.",1,0,1614715476,EnderSword
