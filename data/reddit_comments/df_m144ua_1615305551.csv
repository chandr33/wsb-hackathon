50,gqc9jrn,"$ROKU I am quite familiar with MoffettNathanson. I have cited their work on several projects and they are 100% thought leaders in media. Respectively, they are wrong on their updated PT. The valuation concern is unwarranted for $ROKU imo and I disagree with their rationale around a rising rate environment severely limiting the stock. Rates might rise, but we are still historically low. Real rates will keep funds flowing into equities. Roku's only true barrier at this point is global expansion. Otherwise, the story hasn't changed and the stock has already corrected what? Like 35%. It is much more reasonable here, but even at 400+ it is not at all overvalued when you look at the value of a streaming platform/OS...there is risk obviously, but damn, I love $ROKU here.",1,0,1615305605,calcology
