21,gpfcmiw,"I don't want to be that ape who goes out the reservation and get pouched but I was wondering if a big squeeze like the one we saw in January will actually happen? Don't get me wrong I think gme will stay relatively high but will we see another explosion like we did in January? The January squeeze is happened because it was sudden and no one was expecting it. This caused a gamma squeeze as it was projected that all call options were going to be ITM which is a problem as a lot of them were naked calls and not enough shares to cover the call contracts. This and the shorts currently in GME started the momentum of all short &amp; gamma squeeze to occur one after the other. But now after the lockout and the ample amount of time the HFs had to prepare (i.e., purchasing call options to cover their shorts) wouldn't the squeeze be a much smaller? Before people go ape shit on me I am a fellow ape and have my stake in gme but just wanted to know what I am missing that proves a massive short squeeze will still happen.",1,0,1614700680,Jealous_Object4137
22,gpfcuyw,As in cash a big dip. MM buy shares to cover once call options contracts are bought by investors. If he exercises it won't change anything. MM already have the shares. It's called delta hedging,1,0,1614700784,Vaginosis-Psychosis

25,gpfdnjx,"Melvin capital themselves claimed that the squeeze back in january was actually not a short squeeze. A high up in interactive brokers stated that the january push would have gone into the thousands easily if the buy button had not been disabled. What we are waiting for is both a gamma squeeze, and then a short squeeze (cover short positions). If there are no shares to buy back (because retail owns them), then the demand will be high enough for the price to rocket. Once it rockets, some retail will be satisfied to sell at a certain price, then hedge funds will buy it from them. The whole gamestop situation also has become very popular, and has attracted more investors (not just retail but big boys). That is why I belive this squeeze will be astronomically larger. But of course, DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. I am not a financial advisor.",1,0,1614701142,Holdmykids
26,gpfdo15,You're ignoring the borrow rate - A lowering of a borrow rate (which we're seeing) means it's getting easier to find shares to short.   A rising rate means it's getting harder.,1,0,1614701148,daddyj11

31,gpfhgfl,"Yea that's what I was saying about the potential explosion being caused by a gamma follow by the HF in the short position panic will likely result in a crazy price per share. However, now that HF are prepared and most likely have purchased call options to slowly move out of their short position will this likely happen again? We still may be another gamma squeeze but wouldn't the HF be able to use their call options to sell the shares at a decent price to keep the price of the stocks at a reasonable price?",1,0,1614702832,Jealous_Object4137
