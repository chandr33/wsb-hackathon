I also am one of those people who almost bought at the peak üòÖ So I couldn't post before because of the 30 day wait time and I just wanted to say that I had so much fun in these first few weeks. Some of you guys are hilarious and I was laughing so hard reading all the comments and posts at that time. It was really the best time in this whole pandemic. Of course it was only a matter of time before HF's send bots to demoralize the community and that leads to conspiracy. I don't know how many bots are at this forum or how many mods are involved now but the best way to handle these things is to just ignore them. Don't post your conspiracy theories, don't interact at all if you belive something like RKT is a scam (which it probably is, I don't know or care). Don't make the same mistake HF's do when they try to avoid GME to rocket by giving it even more stage time. 

For the mods, make official posts, be transparent, call out people you suspect to be a bot. Everything else will lead to fud and is dangerous for the forum as a whole.
