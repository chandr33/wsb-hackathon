3,gqie67u,AMC had a great sub model pre covid. When theaters are at full capacity again the company will stand to make a lot of money again. The leadership has to change our the company may burn.,7,0,1615420835,HellmoSandvich

6,gqie9zx,"Cinema was struggling massively long before Covid. Like massively, don‚Äôt you all remember?!

It‚Äôs just a ridiculous company to actually invest in for anything other than the gamble. At which point just invest in GME because that has the gamble and a chance of turning around.

And diluting the shares and greedily taking bonuses is just the icing on the cake I don‚Äôt know how anyone is still loyal after that",1,0,1615420889,make_more_1013

11,gqiewph,"The buying and holding of AMC shares has nothing to do with long term profits and everything to do with the HFs attempting to force them into bankruptcy by using shorts to kill the company.  That was wrong.  It would put people out of work and theaters out of business, none of which we want to see. Now that the squeeze is on it means that we will also all make money when the HF is forced to buy all of our stock at an incredibly inflated price. Which is just icing on the cake after we helped keep them from killing these companies. 

Also traditionally when a company is having trouble, keeping their ceo is important, so they give them a benefit in stock options, which is what he got. Which means that he profits when we profit. He used the extra money generated by the stock sell off to restructure their debt and other beneficial things for the company as a whole. He has done very well and is going to bring AMC through with the help of us apes. 

Added benefit teaching the HF a lesson that us apes are important and that gambling with peoples lives and livelihoods for the sake of profit is wrong. 

Another benefit is we have caused the SEC to change their rules to prevent this from happening again due to the fact it could bring down the stock market itself if they are not careful.",22,0,1615421226,Marlinspikehall32

13,gqif0p6,"I literally don‚Äôt give a shit tbh! It‚Äôs your money to do with whatever you wish, and best of luck to you! Just my opinion. Cinema really is fucked tho. Surely you must have been to a big budget movie opening weekend and sat with, like, 3 other people? I know I have",1,1,1615421287,make_more_1013
14,gqif0wq,"Idk, from a company standpoint, they both have bleak futures. GameStop to me is like blockbuster 15 years ago. I buy all my games digitally now directly from Microsoft. They will need to adjust accordingly and swiftly if they‚Äôre going to survive. Calling a spade a spade here, both companies are in trouble. 

Not a hedge fund bot or anything like that. I like both stocks due to the massive hedge manipulation. However, I am only in AMC 40@$9.46 and going to see where it goes.

15,gqif43l,"Why we have to play this game, my drunken mind will never understand. 

It‚Äôs not a fucking competition - it‚Äôs 2 companies that have followed trends for the past 3 months, and both are corner-able for squeeze. 

It‚Äôs like trying to pick between 2 twin sisters...why pick one when you can have both?",12,0,1615421337,SilverDollar_2021

19,gqifagi,I think this is why hedgies and wallstreet are looking to hire ‚Äú Reddit investors‚Äù. They want people with karma on their accounts. They want you so when the time is right they can say hey go on the website you like so much and tell em how much amc is hurting. Our only defense right now is new account karma.,5,0,1615421431,usernamewamp

26,gqifvoe,"Imo Gamestop has No Plan at all. Maby GME will survive a few years but IT has No Plans for the Future . And without that they will Go down . Selling Games online ? There are plenty Others already doing that . 

AMC in the Other Hand is a huge Chain of cinemas which Opens again atm. 
People will rather watch the big Movies in the Cinema with big screens and nice audio rather then on their little Screens with average audio . 
AMC has way more Potential to survive after a possible squeeze than GME . Imo. This is Not advice",1,0,1615421744,thatguyovertheresix9
