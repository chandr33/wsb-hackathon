Edit: If you need some help understanding the metrics we use to measure dips, volume, and price movement, I recommend reading posts with the 'DD' flair. You can get to them pretty easily, and they'll explain the current research going on with GME's price action during the squeeze. DD is short for Due Diligence and means research done on a stock before investing.
