And DFV said

""As for me, I like the stock"" uh-huh ""and my band's red, hang in there, kids""

Well, since age 12 I've felt like a retarded melv. Cuz I trusted my funds to a hedgie, and hell, I got so pissed off I ripped Vlad Tenev's dick off and smacked him so hard his bulgarian ass went underground like hedge-hogs.

I whip out my credit card fast and overdraft that bitch fast, like Plotkin paying me 100k to fuck his wife in the ass.

""Wait a minute, that's my money dawg""

I don't give a fuck, this ape's üöÄ is bout to take off.
