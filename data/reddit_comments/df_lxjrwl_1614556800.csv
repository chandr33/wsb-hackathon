76,gpnu2d7,"You post DD 1.5 hours before market. 

It does not garner enough attention on wsb to sticky up on front page and now there are reports that its the new play for wsb by 10pm with it being up 15% and expect us to believe this isn't astroturfing.

The gme long was going on for a year, a freaking year, before wsb decided it was a good investment.

Some situations like rkt happen because of unexpected actions like the ceo calling in the shares, pure luck, will happen but it takes longer than 2 hours for 10 million people to digest a DD to come to a consensus.

Anyhow, I see this playing out like this... a few can't lose trades will pop up where only a few will catch it.

This will be the ""Training"" for dumb apes to drop money in before they do their own DD in which they cash out big or watch other monkeys win big.

Eventually, there will be a trap laid that will demolish wsb retards and all their credibility.

I hope everyone takes the time to do their own DD before trading big. Don't get trapped into trading before looking. Learn to recognize the difference between a stank and a stonk.
