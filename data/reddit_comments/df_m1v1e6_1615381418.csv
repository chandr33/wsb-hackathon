38,gqfw707,"Very true! I was originally in GME at 20 back in December but them bottled it and got bored. Only managed to get back in before the first spike at around 70, bottled it again at 130 or so, then back in at 234 and sold at 410.

Learned a lot that first time. The second time I bought on Wednesday 24th of Feb because I was off sick and couldn't work out what else to get into. Woke up at 3pm to it shooting through the roof and i'll held up to 240. 

I know nothing about trading, but I do know about gambling which is why i'm trying to find something less hyped and outside of GME to maybe prove I can actually do it! 

The gains did pay for an engagement ring for the missus though.
