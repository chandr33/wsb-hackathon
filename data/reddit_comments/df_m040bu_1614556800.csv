31,gq5ygch,Video games are responsible for the best attitude change humans have ever experienced. Kids who grew up with them don’t give up when a problem is presented. They are conditioned to know there is  a solution to every problem and a workaround for every roadblock so they keep trying until they figure it out. That can’t be said about previous generations. Gen x and boomers quit more shit than any other generation in history because they are entitled and protected from their failures. Check the stats on how many of them finish law school but never pass the bar it is an unbelievable number most of whom coasted through school and gave up the minute things got difficult. Previous generations couldn’t quit because they’d starve to death. Millennials have learned that attitude and their attitude towards us is completely justified.,1,0,1615168226,Jebjohan

THIS STUFF IS LIKE ***TRILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY***

LETS BE ON OUR:

STAR TREK

STAR WARS

ETC

BUY HODOR

**FOR THE SQUEEZE:**

***Limit Sell Order: $999,999.99***

As of now we’re all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you’re unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you’re concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!

$999,999.99

Let’s ALL get THE BEST PRICE!

That's why UI design is important to us, and it seems like an obvious engineering solution to make money more user friendly.
