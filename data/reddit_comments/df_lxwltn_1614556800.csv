15,gppny9i,no you buy a call and sell a call that isn't the one you bought.,4,0,1614900411,DeliciouslyUnaware
16,gppo4qs,"But aren’t you then just doubling your risk? Instead of getting rid of it?

You’ll be on the hook for both calls. The original 376 and the other 377",-1,0,1614900502,AlthanRalinor
17,gpppc7o,"The call you sell is ITM, so what happens if/when it gets exercised?",1,0,1614901106,sunscooter
18,gppqmbq,"Your long call is exercised first. 

So you buy 100 shares for $376 each (long 376c) and then you sell 100 shares for $377 each (short 377c). Thats why you don't need any purchasing power. Your 376c can be exercised and will always cover the cost of exercising the 377c",6,0,1614901758,DeliciouslyUnaware
19,gpprcyc,No you are using the one you own as collateral to sell the other one. You are taking risk off of the table.,2,0,1614902136,DeliciouslyUnaware

21,gpprzcn,And what happens if the price goes down? You still lose money?,-1,0,1614902457,AlthanRalinor
22,gppt8m1,"Both options expire worthless and you pocket the premium from selling the 377 call. You still make that profit regardless. 

This is called a vertical spread, and is a trading strategy used to minimize risk hundreds of thousands of times every day.

Let's say you bought the 376c for $1.00. Then after the price went up, you sold the 377c for $3.00.

Then, as in your scenario, SPY plummets to $370.

Your 376c becomes worth $0. But you sold the 377c for $3.00. You get to keep the $300 because someone bought it from you for $300 and now it is worthless",10,0,1614903102,DeliciouslyUnaware
