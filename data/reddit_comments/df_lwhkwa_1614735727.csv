12,gphiam1,"My thoughts:

 I held from 380 (all I saw on RH) down to 38 (as seen on Fidelity, I got out of RH). I had severe doubt at that point, but averaged down, and bought more in my 401k on Fidelity. That was the closest I have been to selling, but my diamond hands are too hard.

I likely will sell to cover only my initial investment. This way I have more ammo for any future dips/plays. I will hold the rest until Valhalla. The amount I would sell is nothing (like ten shares). Significantly more would remain in my pocket. 

100k would be tits. Diamond hands will get us there. Nothing wrong with taking some tendies off the top. Just don't dump everything or you may miss stupendous gains.
