7,gpm8swi,I am long on ocgn as well. Not many people know about this as it does not get much mainstream promo.  Steal at this price IMO. Today’s PR on  Bloomberg I felt had a negative context as “experiment” and interim was misleading.,29,0,1614831045,FOXFOMO

17,gpma7fo,"I honestly sold a lot of my shit today thinking holy hell, what if the market does collapse? Let me sell some trash and buy back when things look better. Use it to buy puts on stuff I wanna keep and sell the put to hedge my losses. And I couldn't sell OCGN. I got too much love for it. Their nasal spray for covid that might save Africa and India who can't afford our expensive pharmaceuticals? Trying to cure blindness? A small time company just trying to save their people instead of waiting for America or the EU to do itM Fuck it, let's buy. I think not everything is about profit. I genuinely will keep it out of love and hope they can be the Indian JNJ. I love America, but I'm that asshole globalist your Republican Grandpa warned you about.",21,0,1614831847,horrorhoney

38,gpnoxsb,"I'm still new with a lot of this, but it seems like OCGN has had a lot of very positive news coming out back-to-back and the price should be much higher.    
I've heard institutions like Sabby come along and push the stock down and I see that they're invested in OCGN.  So is it them driving the price down below 10, the red market, or both?",3,0,1614869562,mug6688

40,gpo505k,"Because it's been crashing all week, and last week too. Experts were expecting at least a 10% correction, up to 50% (doom and gloomers). We were at 8. So the market might keep constricting. Be cautious. If it goes up quick, you'll be rich. But if it doesn't, you'll be bleeding money.",5,0,1614876613,horrorhoney
