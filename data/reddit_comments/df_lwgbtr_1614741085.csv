3,gphsf8k,"They originate loans through their app and basically don't hold onto the loans. They are valued as a financial company aka bank, forward p/e very similar to Bank of America for example. Except I think it's reasonable that they be valued as a **fin**tech company, aka growth company with the forward p/e numbers that go with it. People are barely going to bank branches these days to sign mortgages with the pandemic, and I don't think that's going to go back to normal, with the additional tech now available and busy lifestyles, people are going to want to get a loan through an app.",5,0,1614741267,mrfocus22

GME is a retail video game seller with a store just doen the road from.y house that went out if business.  RKTs rise completely makes sense and honestly their stock price should have been way higher than the 20s for a while now.  

Games rise is crazy (awesome, because of what the community pulled off), but RKT's increase is well deserved.",2,0,1614743702,Sandro757
50,gphx70p,"Here’s another thing to add; another user on this sub likely fully decoded Ryan Cohen’s tweet.

In short, he’s likely going to invest in Super League Gaming, owned by Anne Hand, who worked at Project Frog (hence the frog emoji) as well as McDonand’s (hence the McD’s ice cream).

If you want to get very deep, Anne Hand also owns a Diamond jewelry company (Diamond hands), and got a Master’s from DePauw University (DFV’s poster and identity).

You have it at 275, sell it at 200 or 150 for a loss of 75 or 125, but you buy back when it dips down to 50 or 75 to sell at a higher price later. If you sell your $50 at 125, you've recouped your 75 original loss. If you sell your $75 for 200, you've recouped your 125 original loss. Examples of course, but you get the idea.
