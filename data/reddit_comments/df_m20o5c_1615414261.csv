1,gqi13gb,"I mean the smart non meme method is to sell in stages. I bought at 60 too and if it does hit 1000$ I'm selling to cover my initial cost for the stock. The rest you can ride out then right. At that point you are recouped for losses and anything extra is a Chery on top.

33,gqjqubz,"If they were to cash out, it would cost them an incredible amount of money to do so. They would have to cover any potential naked shorts, the shorts they are currently using to keep the price down, and give back many many many shares.

This would drive price up a staggering amount.

The trouble there is the left-hand doesn't know what the right-hand is doing. If Melvin, Citadel and Point72 were to try and cash out individually, it would sink the other two, as the price would rise staggeringly, triggering their shorts.

If they colluded, which is illegal, there'd still be the issue of who sells out first, and that 60 second window could cost them incredible amounts to sell off. Whoever sells 2nd, likely dies from the value - how much would you trust another hedgefund to not sell 5 minutes earlier when you've all agreed to? So even if they collude illegally, they are trapped in the prisoner's dilemma. 

Meanwhile other hedge funds who aren't on anyone's radar, who have shorted during the last gamma squeeze (the one in jan) who have limited exposure would be hit for incredible amounts of money and while they might've taken a modest short position, as these cash-outs occur they suddenly will be on the hook for staggering losses.

You'd see a spike well well over 1000 for this to occur. You can calculate this by looking at FTD records and most importantly, Finra's Short %, which they can't fake, which is around 50%. At 50% of the float, that's the value of about 100m shares at least, multiplied by the current share price. When it was at $40, that would've been something like 40 billion dollars, which exceeded their market capital or was more than they were willing to lose. Even if they could pay it off, bankruptcy would inevitably occur days later as their investors pulled out.

If they were going to do that, they would've done it at 40. We saw a spike around 50, was likely somebody cashing out some short positions when they realized there was no hope to crush this back to $15, but not to the order of magnitude that would cover 50% of the float. That's an astronomical number.

They are more likely to keep pressuring, to get the stock to fall naturally, then slowly try and buy out there positions - but they're running out of time for that.

The time to have fixed this was ages ago, but because people held, it was too expensive for them to do so at 40 - very likely it would've bankrupted them, and they chose, instead, to fight to survive.

Really in my opinion, they aren't going all-in to save their company - but to give themselves time to get money offshore, get divorces (melvin capital's CEO did exactly that) and hide their assets, so when the company goes under, it goes under big.

I'm sure their cousins and best friends are buying GME mysteriously, so they get their windfall as these companies essentially cash out this business by creating such a monumental explosion everyone can profit except for the DTCC and banks that let them do these insane practices in the first place.

If your house is burning, might as well burn the whole town down, because then it's a disaster and not just, ""You're an idiot who burned your house down"". Evil stuff, but that's the story.

So no, this doesn't end if they cash out longs, even if they collude - because that would start a rocket of its own and more likely, just vacuum suck other companies who couldn't possibly organize a mass unified buyback even if they tried. Their own banks and the DTCC would sniff that out in a heartbeat and block it because, well, that's a whole 'nother issue.

They aren't ""chums"" and these banks are loving these premiums on these shorts, so they will let them bleed forever, they don't want a buyback, so they'll make sure no organized buyback occurs.

This also didn't cover the naked shorts - which effectively, for every naked short, they have to buy 2 shares at current market value, and we know they're hiding vast amounts more in XRT - and have naked shorted that as well.

THose buybacks? Impossibly high numbers.

So don't worry, keep reading, welcome to the game.
