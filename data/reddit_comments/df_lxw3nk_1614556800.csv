0,gppaue9,Be prepared for some up and down. They have a solar plant coming online in quarter 2. But they will take a hit from any negative publicity regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline. I am planning to use the negative event as my buy in point for more options.,5,0,1614894263,bigbadstoops

2,gppc3ml,Nice! Had no idea. I have been averaging down each time it dips. At 370 shares Avg 5.80 : Anything now that dips is still in the green for me so I'd be averaging up. Can't wait for some Dividies!,1,0,1614894817,IfItsBrokenFixIt
