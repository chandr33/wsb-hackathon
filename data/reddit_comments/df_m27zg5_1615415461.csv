6,gqi3hj5,"Ape hive mind mostly. I'm too new to this to have a worth while opinion. But what I saw in the dip was:

 *  Low volume relative to the price swing compared to other price moving events with GME
 *  Downward pressure before $350 not a massive sell off at $350. I'd expect that most retail investors in ""meme"" stocks set take profit orders for whole dollar amounts.

  


To me these suggest there was another factor in play. IMO Occum's razor points to hedge funds that shorted the stock (could be more ape hive mind) since they have a lot to lose and are professionals that know how their trades can affect the stock price.",5,0,1615415471,BainDmg42
