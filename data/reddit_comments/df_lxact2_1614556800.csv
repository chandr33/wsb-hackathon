0,gplwezj,Just sold my Royal caribbean I bought last year for a nice profit,8,0,1614824600,freakymarky
1,gplwfmw,"im up 65% with 3k NCLH shares.

Main thing you need to add to your bear case is the amount of new debt they took on over the last year. Any hit to overall business over the next few years could cause serious issues for them. 

I donâ€™t expect them to be back to $60 anytime soon, but $40 is starting to look very possible.",7,0,1614824609,SR_Powah

5,gpm24ez,I guess you weren't looking at cruise line stocks last March. I made some decent money with RCL.,4,0,1614827450,linkedit
6,gpm293l,1 year ago was the time to jump on cruise stocks,7,0,1614827518,linkedit
7,gpm2knk,Indeed!  I was late to the cruise line investments for fear of the reopening schedule and who might sell off and go under.  Iâ€™m not pretty confident that this is a good play going forward for a 100% gain by EOY,1,0,1614827683,Coloroasted

9,gpm2rzl,They arenâ€™t at all.  Norway is a country with multiple businesses.  Airlines and cruise lines arenâ€™t related.,3,0,1614827790,Coloroasted

12,gpm32cx,"They all (RCL, CCL and NCLH) probably all have a lot of bookings. Though I havenâ€™t done any DD on how long they can hold on till everything opens up. 

My other concern is that of course the die hard cruisers will be back but will they continue to get new cruisers? I went on a cruise on RCL the December before Covid and will definitely be back when everything opens up.",1,0,1614827938,linkedit
13,gpm39zf,Unfortunately the only answers to this are speculative.  My speculation is that boomers will be back at it as soon as theyâ€™re vaccinated.,1,0,1614828045,Coloroasted

17,gpm6nmz,Shhhhhhhhh this is my sleeper stock..bagged a quick $550 today and going back in tomorrow.,1,0,1614829841,UpDimension
18,gpmazcj,"Bought NCLH back in early jan, also bought CCL too. Both up around 40% since.  NCLH 140@24.08 and CCL 150@20.41. Love cruising and will definitely jump on the boat when they get the green light to sail again.",1,0,1614832306,starmandan
