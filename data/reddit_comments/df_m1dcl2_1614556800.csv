4,gqd0ni8,"Ok, but so what? Do we really expect the FED to reduce their balance sheet? There is no way the FED is going to let the cookie crumble, for better or worse. If the FED actually had economic stability in mind, interest rates would've been raised a loooong time ago. We're building a house of cards. It is what it is.

13,gqd760m,"It is actually one of the interesting things that has happened over the past 30 years.  Everyone always says in the long run the market always goes up and you can't time it. So just put money in your 401k  and keep buying.  I work with a bunch of 50 year olds who are planning on retiring in 2-3 years. They have 401ks with 1-2 million in them and didn't bat an eye last March. 

After the great recession these people saw what happens to the people who got scared and sold. So they will never do it.  It is less obvious, but the whole market has its own version of GME ðŸ’Ž ðŸ§¤ going on. Everything is overpriced, but everyone refuses to sell and it becomes the new normal.",5,0,1615319937,lonedirewolf21

33,gqehnrx,"I will add an anecdote specific to mutual funds. There is a simple reason for low participation in them separate from the rampant speculation in the rest of the market.

Mutual funds make their money in the money market- mainly overnight repo and up to 1 month term loans.

The front end of the yield curve is totally fucked with the fed pinning the overnight rate to virtually zero. Pre covid these funds could get close to 2% annualized on a collateralized overnight loan. Now they make nothing.

So yea mutual funds have shit yield so why bother",1,0,1615342685,PajeetScammer
