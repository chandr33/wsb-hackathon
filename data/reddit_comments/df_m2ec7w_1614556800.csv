1,gqinnds,"It’s really hard to change the market because you have a many investors who been through this old system and succeed. Not saying there isn’t anything fishy going on in Wall Street but if any changes occur more people would rather cash out and leave then get accustomed to changes.  That’s why WSB needs to be the change! If we turn into a legit company we can show Wall Street how real investors want to do with there money instead the other way around. 

WSB LLC! Don’t hate the players hate the game!! We become the game they have to change on our terms",1,0,1615425875,Substantial_Boss_619

10,gqipbf2,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,3,0,1615426742,VisualMod
