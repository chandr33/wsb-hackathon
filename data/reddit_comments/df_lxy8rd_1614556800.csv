Just getting out of PMCCs and pretty much shares only


Wish I hadnt over extended recently in other things. Tax refund will be 1000 shares or so of BB. Would like 5000 at some point",25,0,1614900093,InfiniteElway

4,gppnz7j,"BB fair market price is like 6.50. I would say that is extremely low. However I plan on waiting till the price is pushed that low, or probably lower, then buy a bunch for a big discount. Buffet does this shit. Makes the decision to buy, then waits for the right time to grab it. Do your DD. Check finviz for said fair market value.",-26,0,1614900424,JimCricket99

7,gppr1cz,"Honestly BB is a nice slow roast for tendies.

However I really do want it to dip to 5$ all so I can stock up on way more shares for my moneys worth.

It makes 0 sense why it's at &lt;10$ with all the good news and buisiness prospects it has.

Also this is not financial advice. Go suck a diseased dick if you think it is.",64,0,1614901973,AVeryConfusedRedhead

13,gppumfi,"Thank you OP for your evaluation of the conference today.  Your post is most excellent.  I appreciate you taking the time to calm the autist's and bring reality back into the picture.

A lot of paper hands here forget that BB took on one of the biggest tech giants in court and won.  They have still yet to disclose the amount of the settlement.  

The future of BB is so bright it blinds my eyes sometimes.  Again I appreciate your down to earth post.  

Current Position: 4700 shares at an average of 14.21.

Also... Buy the dip my fellow autist's.

14,gppuyrb,"As a seasoned BB bagholder, I appreciate seeing all these threads about BB being great, but you also don't really need to sell anyone. Anyone with BB knows they're a good play, and I doubt anyone would dispute BB as such. That being said, thanks for the DD, keep holding, etc",40,0,1614903971,anthonyburcheatscum
15,gppvhkf,"AtHoc revenue is going to surprise some at earnings.  Look at BB's twitter feed, and you will see that they are really promoting AtHoc.

IVY may lead to fantastic recurring revenue in a few years, but AtHoc can drive recurring revenue NOW.  Tell your local politicians that you want better crisis/disaster warning management and notifications.  For something so critical, it needs to be hack proof.  Watch BB make some huge AtHoc sales going forward.",11,0,1614904235,JuvenileRockmover
