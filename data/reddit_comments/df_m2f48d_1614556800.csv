""They"" is the problem with this thinking.


There are Hedge Funds playing GME from every which-way. There are probably more Long (""our side"") than Short at this point. We are riding the waves generated by their battle.


MAYBE the entity that dropped that massive short-bomb today thinks momentum will burn out fast enough that it'll be able to pick up the scraps or at least break even on the amount they owe.

MAYBE they drove the price down to buy a fuckton of calls for the eventual gamma.

There's no telling really. But institutional money is in GME up the wazoo, and they're throwing fucking haymakers both ways.",6,0,1615431554,TurdLipstick
