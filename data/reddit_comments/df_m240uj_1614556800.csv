8,gqh241l,"Listen to me:

You still own those same shares of GME. 

Chances are VERY good the price will squeeze up to its prior levels and beyond again.

The WORST thing you can do right now is sell at a loss.

Let's imagine this happened to you in January and you sold for a huge loss when the price went to $60. You would have made that loss permanent AND missed your chance to get out even or better in March.",1,0,1615399602,KanyeYandhiWest

You invested. relax. Breathe. You have 15 days to get your money back with intreset. When it dips, buy it and double down. GME earnings is coming up, they have a good revenue. No profits yet due to the lockdown....but revenue. Come back in 15 days.",1,0,1615399916,Red_Master
