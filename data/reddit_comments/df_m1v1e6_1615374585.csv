77,gqfneu6,"I say no to a higher minimum wage because it will price certain jobs out of the market. Every time the minimum wage goes up employment goes down. This is a fact. 

Also because I was at Taco Bell/Pizza Hut three weeks ago and I ordered a supreme pizza from the Pizza Hut portion as a contrast to the three Taco Bell things I had already ordered. I always request a side or marinara sauce which they insist on calling “breadstick sauce” because many of these people are very surface. The woman forgot the sauce, then told me they didn’t have it, then told me they had it but they were going to charge me extra for it. I lost it. I said to this woman “I’ll kill you. I’ll legitimately kill you when your shift is over. I’ll wait for you and kill you in the parking lot”. 

It’s important to remember companies will just replace workers with touch screen computers and other forms of technology to offset costs. She then laughed at me which further enraged me. “You are getting murdered tonight do you hear me? Where’s my fucking sauce. I’m gonna stab you in the parking lot when you leave”. 

Unemployment among young people is very high and demanding companies pay 15 dollars an hour for an entry level job may cause them to cut hours or eliminate the job completely. This was a white woman who spoke the language perfectly. She heard me order sauce. She refused to provide it because she was hoarding it to feed her neglected children. I tried to look deadly, stared directly at her, and began to mouth the words “You’re fucking dead.” 

You can’t invent wages in a free market. “This isn’t a joke. I’m going to rip the skin off your face” That made her slightly uncomfortable and she said “I’m calling the police”. As I drove away I screamed “This is your last night on earth whore”. The living wage argument is a complex issue. And hopefully we opt for a market based solution as more well meaning government controls will have unintended consequences.",1,0,1615374790,MFGrim
