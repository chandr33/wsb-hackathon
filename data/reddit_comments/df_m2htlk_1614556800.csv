While the flexibility is cool they need to improve range. Pricing, if high as I suspect, will mean it is not a vehicle sold in high volume.

Also, and perhaps most critically, it is an EV with no screen as you are supposed to use your phone screen. I have a car with Android Auto and Apple Car Play built-in and I prefer by far, when driving, to use that larger screen.

The SEC website showed TD ameritrade having the GOEVW title with EXP 12/21/2025. Strike is $11.50. How is the right to buy the stock at $11.50 selling for only $5.08???",1,0,1615529521,weekendclosetgunnut
90,gqnydtl,"$5 is a $2 premium - $14.50 stock price minus $11.50 exercise = $3

I generally don't buy warrants once they go much past $4, but that's just my personal preference.  As always, read the warrant agreement, but there's usually a clause where they can redeem them once they've been over $18 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days. 

If you have a stock that's been depressed below $18 for a long time and suddenly spikes this is great - this is what I was looking for in goev - but it's significantly different than typical LEAPS where you're betting on the long term future of the company and can ride it out for a couple years.  It's very likely the company redeems the warrants within the first 6 months if they're doing well. This isn't a cheap 2025 LEAP.

Don't be scared of redemption - you get a 30 day warning email from your broker and can exercise your warrants during that period or sell them. Just be aware that it can happen so you don't miss it and get a few pennies for them by ignoring the redemption notice!

The reason I typically don't buy over $4 is because redemption intrinsic value is around $6.50, so that gives a nice profit margin even if the underlying stock doesn't skyrocket, and just lazily sits slightly above $18 for a while. Feel free to use a different strategy, that's just my conservative approach.

Also be aware that warrants will generally trade at a discount until they're exercisable. In this case goev warrants ***are*** exercisable so they aren't trading at a discount, but if you see other spacs that have warrants don't be surprised at a gap in the pricing.  Warrants typically become exercisable 30 days after merger or 1 year after the spac launches, whichever comes ***later***.  There are a few high profile spacs merging 6 months after launch, and their warrants won't become exercisable for another 6 months so they'll continue to trade at a risk discount.  

Typically they have to become exercisable before the company can call redemption but this is not always the case, I've seen some with clauses that allow for early redemption that also triggers your ability to exercise early. As always, read the warrant agreement!

Warrants are complicated, but worth learning about because they can be good leverage if you play them right.",1,0,1615530702,imunfair

$GOEV 

[New Ortex Dropped...](https://u.teknik.io/wncri.png) We saw a net decrease in SI by around 700k.  DTC dropped as well by to 1.3.  Utilization is still at 100. Average Age is back to 19.   

I think there is a lot you can think about this.  

Either the AH action was a small portfolio getting nuked and the shares being returned or it was that the presser was great.  Ah volume alone was not sufficient to account for all the covering. DTC lowering is mixture of both the significant increase in volume yesterday and the decrease in SI. 

Actually let's not be too binary and say that it's a combination of all sorts of things.

The fact that yesterday  700k shares of the recently deployed SI were covered is indicative of the tactical employment of SI in the first place in my opinion. Rough estimates are that this was done at a loss of 2 - 3 million dollars. IT might be a smart idea to continue to do this do try and take the edge off. Or it could be a sign of desperation.    We could read this as a retreat or reloading.... 

They still have 9.3 million shares that need to exit the ticker...  

But if they have the 1 million shares back they can continue to slow down its movement.  Essentially costing Longs time and money.  This would have a greater impact should the volume return to its usual levels.

Edit - Also a Gap open is current PM prices lets not get greedy folks... :)
