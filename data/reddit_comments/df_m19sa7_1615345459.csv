The MOASS is clearly still on its way and there are a TON of catalysts for it to happen even this month. If you want to see whether or not he‚Äôs right, the best thing any of us can do is simply continue to buy and hold and wait.

Edit: One more thing: hedgies know the squeeze is now inevitable and have changed their tactics to get people to sell at $1k when in reality the squeeze should EASILY hit well over $10k (and $100k is also possible IF enough investors hold long enough.) The fact that this commenter is now pushing the idea of a small gamma squeeze instead of the MOASS fits right into the hedgies new narrative they want to push.",1,0,1615349109,akrilexus

A huge number of these ""naked shorts"" are merely trade execution for funds and other investors.  

1. Fund places a sell order for a stock with their broker.
2. Broker routes that order to a market maker. Market makers aren't like the old floor specialists that that take on risk with their own capital, so...
3.  Market maker / executing broker will/can (in simple terms) instantly short into the market (OMG Naked!) 

* This is recorded on the tape as a short sale  
 
* The market maker then immediately buys the shares from Fund's broker to instantly cover that few-millisecond short.  
 
* This second leg is not recorded on the tape (to avoid double counting share volumes), and is one of the reasons why nobody understands the ""daily short sale volume reports""",1,0,1615354220,enymarra
