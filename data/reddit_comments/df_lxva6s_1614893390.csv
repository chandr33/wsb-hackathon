87,gpp91ts,"It‚Äôs bad for tech stocks with sky high valuations as higher inflation means higher expectation. Anyone using a valuation model uses a discount rate for a target price, that discount rate is usually inflation or long-term treasury yield. The higher it is, the more investors will expect from a company to return. If the company isn‚Äôt returning what‚Äôs expected, the valuation will correct.

Also investors want to he compensated for inflation risk so they may seek stocks that consistently pay and increase their dividend. That dividend compensates for some inflation risk. 

Companies that don‚Äôt have real (physical) assets  struggle during higher inflation. For example, a software company can‚Äôt exactly raise prices with inflation where as other companies who deal with physical products can. It can hurt their margins as costs can increase faster than revenue. Financial companies, like banks, benefit as they lend at higher long-term rates and pay interest at lower short-term rates. The larger the interest rate spread, the more money they will make. 

Inflation isn‚Äôt bad for all stocks, just the ones that are currently the most heavily weighted in the S&amp;P 500, which is tech.",3,0,1614893477,plasticblock4dayz
