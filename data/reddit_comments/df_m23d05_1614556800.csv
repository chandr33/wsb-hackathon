1,gqgxuz1,"People hyping it, pretending to go to the moon then jumping out when they hit their goal.  Not having a go at it, its their money..but it just shows that you shouldnt listen to 'hold until this' and set your own goal.  


On the other hand, BUY! lol",4,0,1615398150,Ditchy69

I had a stop loss on, so I'm safe...(didn't trigger when I wanted, so came out with a little less gain).

May go back up..but stuff like this does tend to repeat itself.",2,0,1615398642,Ditchy69
