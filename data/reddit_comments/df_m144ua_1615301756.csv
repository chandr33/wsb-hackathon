4,gqbzxcf,"It took long enough but I almost understand WSB.  I joined a couple years ago when I opened a RH account.  The memes and talk were really funny but I really didn't understand wth was going on here.  I stayed for awhile for the memes, but left before Covid.
I came back in mid January because I realized investing for retirement is not at all interesting.  Its fucking boring.  Watching your account grow is almost as much fun as watching corn grow.
With GME in the news I started actually reading the posts. I've learned more in 8 weeks watching and reading a bunch of autist apes with smooth brains and simian creased hands than I did in nearly two years of reading about 'investing.' I think of all the bets I could've lost and kick myself.
I'm looking to trade options for the first time in the next week.  Gonna pop that 🍒 and lose $500.",6,0,1615301761,Semi-Pro_Biotic
