91,gqarvb8,"&gt;They have been hemorrhaging money. Do you really think by Hiring new board members who have a ‚Äúplan‚Äù for the future, the company is now literally 2000% to 3000% more valuable. Like you think a company that‚Äôs been bleeding money long before the pandemic is suddenly 20x more valuable because of a hire?



You're forgetting why they were losing money. Almost no one is buying games from brick n' mortars anymore. The VAST majority of people are gaming via mobile, and a majority of non-mobile gamers are getting their games digital thanks to PS/XBox/Nintendo built-in online stores, and PC gamers have a shit load of marketplaces to get games from. The fact is that going to a place to get your games sucks ass most of the time now.

I play a lot of videogames. I used to frequent the hell out of EB Games (Gamestop subsidiary in Canada), and then they lost my business because everything else became more convenient. The shift they're doing is towards e-commerce, like Amazon &amp; similar companies.

 Ryan Cohen created Chewy, which sold to PetSmart for 3.35b dollars. Why? Because ecommerce is the future. Amazon has proven to the world that people want deliveries, not brick n' mortars. Cohen is planning to do the same to Gamestop. GME has the infrastructure already (largest retailer of videogames and related merchandise in the WORLD), they just need to catch up with the times, something Cohen clearly has experience in.

The recent news shows that Cohen has started making his move. The company was bleeding money for years because they kept adding random shit to their stores that a very very small percentage of their customers even wanted (fuck funko pops, ugly pos garbo toys), instead of making their stock more available and convenient to access. Their online store sucked ass, and I pretty much never used it because I always had Amazon Prime and could get my games within 1~3 days of a game releasing, if I wanted a physical copy. 

And that's exactly why GME has a chance - there are still people, like myself, who want physical copies of games, but can't be assed to go pick them up. I don't want to wait in line for 3 hours in a line of unwashed superfans while EB Games throws some boring launch-day event, I just want to play the damn game. If they move to an Amazon-like platform, I no longer have to AND I'll get my physical copy, likely faster than via Amazon, since the store is nearby and they have been using local delivery services (like doordash) to get the games sent same-day.

You're incorrectly assuming that because the company failed before, they'll fail again - not true. You need to reach back further - remember when Gamestop was THE place to be for gamers? Because I do. Before Steam was the insane phenomenon it was now, I was at EB Games once a week to stare at the titles I couldn't afford. 

You're a fool if you think Gamestop catching up with the times isn't going to skyrocket their stock, especially with how much bigger the industry has grown since those days. Back then, only a few nerds played video games and most kids were out playing sports or whatever. Now, nearly everyone is playing games in one form or another, and GME is capitalizing on it. They're late, but not so late that they can't come back.",1,0,1615268196,emailboxu
