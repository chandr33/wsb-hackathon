3,gqgu96m,"I'm not in with lifechanging money, I went in with 10x average 190‚Ç¨. Yesterday evening they picked me back up and I've been riding it. I set my sell orders appropriately this time, though. All that false pride to only sell at 1k+ isn't leading anywhere other than internet points. I learned from that and thankfully had the cash to be able to hold it through the crash.

Thank you and wish you all the best!",1,0,1615396951,JustHereToGain
