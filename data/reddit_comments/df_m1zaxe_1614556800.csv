26,gqgsb7y,You üêê ty for blessing me with the DD. I‚Äôm still hoping we can get a mini squeeze this week. I believe 7 days ago shorts had 7 days to cover. So today. Maybe 40 a hit. This the type of news that should be on every stock covering platform and we should be at 60 from optimism and new investors. Sadly no one talks about it much including on here ty for the great analysis i will cover this stock because this is the pinnacle of deep fucking value and help drop non bias DD just as detailed,3,0,1615396174,Cynical_vibe
27,gqgt9rt,"Shorts are trapped. They take more losses as we move up and there isn't enough volume for them to escape... For all we know, today's move could be from buyers seeing it is undervalued, not from covering. We'll find out in a couple weeks",1,0,1615396560,MrDionWaiters
28,gqgtj54,"u/gpech I'm a big bull for $UNFI also. There are a few more bull catalysts that you are missing:  
\* MEPP reform can save $50m per year  
\* Extra SNAP funding in the stimulus bill  
\* Inflation is good for $UNFI (see earnings call transcript)  
\* Consumers will be slow to return to restaurants (big reopening trade will be overblown) with such high unemployment

58,gqm7axj,"Thanks for your good work. I FOMOed into GME as my first ever stock purchase when it was way too high in January. I'm so new to this I'm still learning how to eat crayons, but thanks to your and several other DDs UNFI was my second investment on Monday (13 @ $31.69), not much but it's honest work I know. 

Was kind of surprised I couldn't see anything about these gains on the 10th but I guess everything's just mental for GME right now. Anyway, nice to also have a 'chill' stock with a quick profit and which looks long-term solid to keep me grounded through this GME stuff. Good find.",2,0,1615496347,Simontheintrepid22
