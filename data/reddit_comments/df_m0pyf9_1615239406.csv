11,gq9bk80,"In the tech bubble, the old guys say they knew it was a bubble but couldn't tell the bubble popped until like a month after the nasdaq peaked.

The bust coincided with tax season - and with Yahoo's unwind following S&amp;P inclusion a few months earlier - 

The high flying ""Janus"" funds, ""the very symbol of tech bullishness"" collapsed with Yahoo, Cisco, and its other high P/E growth holdings by mid April.

The S&amp;P showed relative strength into mid-late March, before it too started to follow the Nasdaq as everyone liquidated. 

The Fed was also forced to raise it's overnight rates for the first time in 5 years in May, due to ""a risk of inflation down the road,"" finishing off the markets.
