44,gqglin5,"$300 resistance looks to be broken. Once things solidify it could mean trading above $300+ for the foreseeable future. 

$300 is a massive level, nice round numbers like $200, 300, 400 ect. play huge roles in resistance since people gravitate towards them for profit taking. Surpassing $300 and staying there sets a floor and also means the next big resistance point is $400.

Mind its likely there will be points before then it struggles to surpass, but $400 really would be the next challenge.
