31,gqfbkgh,"A serious question. Cant the HF cover if they get the shares from either paperhands or even institutional players at a certain price. I mean I did sell and Im probably gonna get downvoted but I still think that my question is not worth a whole post and I dont wanna spread FUD. But I ask myself questions such as : "" When GME hits certain price your classic investor wont buy more shares because it will be too expensive for him and fractions wont bring him lambo anyway... and more importantly big institutions dont really need a squeeze to happen. If their 10 usd shares hit 500 usd they can pocket billions push the price over the edge and make people who only bought a couple of shares and scream that 100K is not meme baghold forever... Im  not a shill I made measly 3,4 k on this frenzy and I know Im gonna miss out big but the shares are too expensive for me rn and itll get worse. Like I first bought at 120 afte the interrupted squeeze and held till 60 usd.  I rebought later at 50, 90 and even at 185 usd but I know it would have to reach like 4000 usd per share for me to pay my 50 k debt and have enough money still to pay taxes. I never believed I was gonna get a lambo. Good luck but be careful. It could be the greatest wealth redistribution or the biggest bull trap ever.

Plus I find it ironic that many people would want the crash market and world economy burn just to buy a new TV or sth. Im not a shill I got nothing to gain on anyone losing right now. My advice If I were eligible to give any would be to hold. But dont expect it to hit 100k per share...",1,0,1615363417,magorianworld
