46,gqh3gw5,"I get that if you have hundreds of billions of dead presidents on the line, it's really nothing to dump a couple of billions worth of stock just to drop the price. That would be a great way to get the price down to a level to cover your shorts. 

But I am really fascinated with how the hedgies are able to push the stock down, only to have apes buy it up and leave them with still no way to cover.  This is the most magical unicorn I've ever seen.

* GME closed yesterday at $246.90 and opened at $269.43
* It climbed 29.35% steadily to today's high was $348.50
* Stuff happened
* GME is currently trading at $264.95. It's down 1.66% on the day (in dramatic fashion).
* **edit: GME is up 7.3% from yesterday's close.** 

Get some chips, enjoy the dip. Hold and buy if you can.

Also change your underwear to the brown pair. Looks like it might be a bumpy ride.
