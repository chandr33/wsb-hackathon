1,gqgdut4,More and more people are opening shorts on IBKR (the number of shares available dropped 100K over the last hour) [https://imgur.com/a/xrv3gBJ](https://imgur.com/a/xrv3gBJ),3,0,1615390396,scboffspring
2,gqgdurp,"Someone who‚Äôs short can buy the shares now, but they‚Äôd have to do so at a huge loss. And once you buy the cheapest share, you then need to buy the next-cheapest, which may be a bit more expensive. That will drive the price up more. So these folks want to wait and see if the price drops before they cover the shares they borrowed. 

The idea being floated here is that if you hold your shares, you control the price. If everyone with GME stock refused to sell at anything less than $1,000, someone who‚Äôs short would have to offer $1,000+ per share (or wait and keep paying interest). Of course, that neglects the facts that (a) people WILL sell at some point and (b) most of the long money is not coming from retail investors like you and me, but from institutions. And they have their own plans.",1,0,1615390396,EconGuy82
