HOWEVER, when I try to buy apple, gamestonk, and anything else it lets me put the order in and says nothing about not having funds. Anyone have some insight as to why they are blocking me from doing this? 

Additional info: I was able to set a buy order on today's IPO with $800 that I deposited yesterday in my personal account. Also on a TD cash account. So I'm unsure why I am getting the rejection on my gf account.",1,0,1615386018,dabearz17
