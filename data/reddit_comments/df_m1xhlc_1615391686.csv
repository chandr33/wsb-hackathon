22,gqggwwf,"Yes, but they don't have many choice, because a lots of them are ITM, so they need the shares. We saw it at the end of January for the montly and weekly, we saw it at the end of february as well from 45 to 180 down to 100 and now we are seeing it at the beginning of the month. Difference is, last week weekly were ITM for most of them, so they needed to buy some shares, hence the price rise. This week most of the calls are ITM, so they will need to buy shares. Next week we still don't know and after that, we will see montly and weekly again. So lots of buying from them in the coming month, because all of the calls are hitting the money slowly but surrely.

Im not even in the play, but this is my conclusion to what is happening right now. I don't think retail buyers bought so many shares that the price rise from 45 to 300 in less than two weeks, when everyone one was laughing at the bagholders, this can't be it. So it must be something else, this is my something else.",2,0,1615391692,SidaMental

Or close the wall up with our English dead.

As modest stillness and humility:

But when the blast of war blows in our ears,

Then imitate the action of the tiger;

Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,

Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;

Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
