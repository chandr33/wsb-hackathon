However: You should read some of the DD threads here. The squeeze play hasn't even started yet, as the hedgies aren't going to cover until they're forced to. They've been kicking the can down the road and now they've kicked themselves into a corner.

Starting next week, one could name their price.

Given the lack of liquidity in the market, I get to ask for a lot more than a thousand bucks a share.
