Short term, the AZ facility won't do anything. I mean, it's good‚Äîthe US has real security/geopolitical concerns, so some domestic production is important (and the fab is [probably huge](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2021/03/02/taiwan-semiconductor-phoenix-plant-35-billion.html))‚Äîbut that facility isn't news anymore. It'll also take years until it's productive, and meant taking on debt. There's also a drought in Taiwan, which may pose real manufacturing problems.
