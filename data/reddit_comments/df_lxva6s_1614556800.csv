&gt;GME TO THE FUCKING MOON FELLOW RETARDS! I LIKE THE STOCK! MY WIFE‚ÄôS BOYFRIEND LIKES THE STOCK! DIAMOND HANDS BOYS UNTIL WE SEE TENDIES üöÄüöÄüöÄüíé‚úã

He finishes his comment and quickly remembers to notate that he‚Äôs not a financial advisor before hitting reply. *‚ÄùThat was close.‚Äù*

His wife and kids are scraping together change around the house to get dinner. Groceries had to wait this week, *his team needs him*. He keeps telling his wife he knows what he‚Äôs doing- *‚Äùthe kids will never go hungry again after they‚Äôre sitting on a mountain of tendies!‚Äù*.. she just doesn‚Äôt understand. Fucking bot. *‚ÄùShe‚Äôs no better than the ‚ÄòOG‚Äôs‚Äô that keep fucking with me and my teammates. Fuck her. She‚Äôll see. They‚Äôll all see!‚Äù*

He doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good play, but surely the other people he saw talking about it online know what they‚Äôre doing, right? Who cares anyways. Fuck the money, this is about the *‚Äúcause‚Äù* now. He‚Äôll go broke if it means costing the ladders even $10 of their *precious money*.
