1,gqe27jj,"When no one is talking about something, it makes me believe it will happen more and more. I haven‚Äôt heard a single person on CNBC talk about this all day which makes me think it will. Though, the technicals of the reports do not bode will for the bull market theory. We have already seen volatility with these interest rates, and if Bill Ackman is predicting a heavier downside, I can‚Äôt say we‚Äôre at out the woods yet.  We are at correction levels already but this auction just happened to coincide with the best day for NASDAQ since November?
