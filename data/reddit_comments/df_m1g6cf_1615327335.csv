That gives you the right to buy 100 shares at $300 each. If you exercise the contract, you gotta have 30,000 to buy those shares. Or you can sell the contract for whatever it is worth. Look up intrinsic vs extrinsic value.

Well, someone mentioned oil and I correlated crude oil pricing, democratic presidency, and vaccines rolling out at the time as bullish for stocks that had not fully recovered from Covid. Well Crude oil was reaching levels not seen in a while and oil stocks were still not correlating with it. Something had to give. Also, oil stocks were at like 90% calls to 10% puts so somebody knew something and that is when i loaded the fucking boat and cashed out here and there along the way. 

That being said, i look almost everything mentioned here in some form or another. That's how I've been somewhat ahead of the memes that plastered here and if i am to late then i don't chase. There is always money be made in the market, It just doesn't have to be today.",1,0,1615327460,Bridgeb5252
