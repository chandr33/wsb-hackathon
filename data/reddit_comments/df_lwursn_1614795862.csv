I hold GME, AMC and RKT but in all honesty, at this specific moment GME was the biggest mistake. I have multiple positions in and I could still come out on top but I don't believe that GME is worth $100+ long term. AMC and RKT seem almost certainly undervalued.

25,gpk8a07,"&gt;	I get that it is a risk and the money I lost, I just chalk that up to my entry fee on learning how to be a better investor.

I get that, but you should listen to this piece of advice:

&gt;To invest, you need a thesis, and you need to be able to stick to that thesis regardless of where the price is going in the short term.

What they are saying is that you need to determine what triggers will initiate your sale. You determine those triggers before you place your buy order. What‚Äôs your target sell price?  Think about this before you place an order and even if you end up losing money, you can look back to your thesis and see if your rules need to be adjusted. 

Make hard rules and don‚Äôt break them. For example, I have a rule that is simply don‚Äôt sell during market hours. I make all my decisions based on the after hours price and analysis of emas, volume, rci, and a few others.",2,0,1614796076,dissimilar_iso_47992
