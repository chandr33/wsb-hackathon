1,gqglgzo,"Kind of my thought as well. I don‚Äôt typically hold for more than a couple weeks but idk, I have a feeling this one might be good. Went in at 0.99 and hoping for the best.",2,0,1615393468,SenatorOfBiscuits
2,gqgn87r,"Bought up at .77 but the fundamentals just aren‚Äôt there. As of today, they have not cut operating expenses. So, although they went debt free on January or whatever, debt is gonna keep coming back.

I held onto mine at .77 but there is just better competition out there. Don‚Äôt even get me started on their big loan.

Just like any other business, there‚Äôs a lot of risk. Which is why I dumped all my money into GME and AMC!!!!! So not financial advice at all. I‚Äôm just an ape who thinks Pot needs to be grown in America!!! ü¶ç now, I will say that buying at .77 and seeing it floating around 1.20 does make me wish I had bought more. But then I remember Wolf of Wallstreet and realize I‚Äôm just the postman buying penny stocks. Caveman? Ape? We are all the same",2,0,1615394166,Prolly-wrong
3,gqgnm9b,"We win some, we lose some, but you only lose when you sell ;) I don‚Äôt have a whole ton of faith in it skyrocketing but I would like to see it make 1.75 or better. I think it can do it. But who knows. It had a good pump already. Maybe it‚Äôs done. Just glad it didn‚Äôt tank today, at least not so far",1,0,1615394317,SenatorOfBiscuits
