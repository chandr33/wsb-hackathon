I think between congressional hearings and hair pulling convos with DTCC, shitadel, melvin etc. All parties involved were told to engineer a small, gradual mini squeeze(small gamma) to appease the peasants. Make us feel we won and be satisfied with mediocre tendies.

They probably even figure $800-1000 will satisfy the apes and GME will fade away.
