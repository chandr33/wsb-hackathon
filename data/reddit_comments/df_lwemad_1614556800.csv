As there's been much debate over which brokerages are most desirable, I took the liberty of making this basic Google form in which you can rate these services 1 - 5.

The purpose of this is merely data collection and curiosity. Let me know if I've missed some, or if this could be somehow improved upon!

13,gpi69nn,"I saw this happen last month on GE, a very highly liquid stock. The stock was trading at 11.22(bid) and 11.23(ask) at high volume. Out of nowhere a sell order for 11.11 goes through and the chart then shows a long lower wick on a red candle. Stock went back to trade at 11.22 right away. This was the only order at that price, all other orders were at 11.22/11.23 and then stock climbed up to 11.30+. It‚Äôs weird, as if someone fat fingered their limit sell order or deliberately tried to sell lower to see if they can cause some panic. I caught this as i was staring at the order book and the chart suddenly showed a spike. Looking at Time &amp; sales confirmed a single order at that lower price, I don‚Äôt think it was a market order as the bid and sell walls at 11.22/11.23 were quite high and it wouldn‚Äôt have gone through.",1,0,1614749468,ari4redd
