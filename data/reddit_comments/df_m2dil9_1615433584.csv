I refer you to my edit on my original comment. I’m not going to keep repeating myself, but the bottom line is that there are two points above. 

1. The article discusses the drop, but was published before the drop. This is a result of the article being updated, not foreknowledge. A common practice. 

2. The URL existed 14 hours prior. That’s also not shocking. A prior article may have been updated into the one you see now. I’ve seen it happen many times over longer timespans than 14 hours. But regardless, you have no reason to think whatever article existed then was the same as what’s there now.

37,gqj2l3v,"Short interest just means shares are out there and available to bring to the market. They don't have to pull the trigger at the time they borrow, they can wait 3 days before either selling them, or returning them. So when the GME apes all say ""short interest is 30%! Holding will hurt them!"", they have no clue if those shorts are even in play yet, let alone if holding a bag hurts or helps them. Today, shorts definitely made a shit ton, apes held as usual. IMO, apes are going to end up holding the bags again if they continue to refuse to take profits all the while the hedge funds continue to circle their wagons in a way that they win regardless of the apes strategy. Holding a stock does not create realized gains, and anyone with a brain will take some profits. Hedge funds are definitely winning GME right now, apes, probably not.",-11,0,1615433825,lxnch50
