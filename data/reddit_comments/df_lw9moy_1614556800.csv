4,gpg2kjy,"  
I just bought the puts straight  -  you could buy the 7 and sell the 5 - cost is 2 cents to make 2.00 bucks - It's a total lottery ticket.",2,0,1614711967,Stockrunning
5,gpg2q00,It is above 10 dollars now - but all of the puts bought - It could be a signal that it will crash over the next week -,1,0,1614712034,Stockrunning

7,gpg3lht,"If you don't understand this trade - The bet is that the stock crashes 50% or more - Can this happen..Yes. If GME can go up 800% (with 26k calls bought for the 800 strike), why can't BB go down 50% - It's a lottery ticket. but hey, the stock was under 5 bucks  3 months ago - and one must ask themself... Who buys Blackberry?  It's now down 35 cents since I posted... One giant drop and this trade doubles or quadruples easily.",1,0,1614712402,Stockrunning
8,gpg4q5r,"I believe it was shared months ago that melvin was long BB. They need funds to fight the war. They are either dumping or shorting to get the put contracts in the money and hoping people sell to help the downward pressure. Me thinks.

Either way BB is going to be ugly next week. Let's hope we get lots of dip buying. Which I would assume some big fish are going to gobble up cheap BB shares.",2,0,1614712880,paulirpolo
