I remember when a Grocery Outlet opened up a few blocks from my House in the Late '80's

At that time, it was a ""transitional"" neighborhood. People loved to shop the revolving stock, seeking new finds for a sweet deal. Overstock, closeouts, dented cans, wine with seriously crappy labels. It tends to sell through stock very quickly and keep bringing people back who spend extra time in the store to search for new stuff.

It is a niche grocer that will often be located in underserved neighborhoods, there will likely be a tax benefit for opening in Opportunity zones. If any of you live in a crap area with no nearby grocery store, I think you know how big this stock can go.

They also tend to find Independent operators that live in these neighborhoods to spearhead opening the stores. A good model for underserved areas.

Having had friends that worked at Gross Out, I can also say that the overall morale is good and that they hire fantastic wine reps. Some of the best wine deals I have ever found were at Gross Out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the Heads Up. I was unaware of their current status, as I have not lived near a Gross Out in a few years. I'll clear out some other underperforming bets and load up.

This is a long Hold with a great potential for short term gravy.",1,0,1614816140,G_yebba
