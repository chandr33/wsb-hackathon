I am not bashing RKT itself, just the play that everyone is hopping on.  CNBC and other media outlets would be all over it in a bad way, if the squeeze people are hoping for was going to happen.

Right now, it is still down 30%.  Yes, it pumped yesterday and I do feel that the company is undervalued, but I think people are expecting it to put out, because their last stall mate in the bathroom in the truck stop did. 

I only have my position in GME until after we hear some changes and plans to implement.  I don't have the position because of faith in a squeeze, but I have faith in Cohen and Crew to work some magic.  What is my exit point?  150-160.  Why didn't I exit the other day when it broke 170?
