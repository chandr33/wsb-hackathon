I don't think so.

&gt;Specifically, the Rule requires that a trading center establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a
short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national
best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered
security‚Äôs closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end
of regular trading hours on the prior day.
