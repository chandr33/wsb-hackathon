19,gpgk4qo,"If you‚Äôre stuck on GME then you really need to educate yourself. There‚Äôs so many stonks and ways to make money. 

It was never about beating the hedge funds, but making money. 

I can‚Äôt believe what this sub has become.  We all used to just wanna gamble and make tendies.",1,0,1614719456,ryan7714
20,gpgk51p,"Why can‚Äôt I support both?

I‚Äôve been a GME gangbanger since late December/ early January and I still am. 

With that said, it sure would help if RC followed RKT‚Äôs CEO‚Äôs footsteps and subtly taunted the HF‚Äôs who have a large S.I position in GME too. 

Regardless, I turned $300 into $1400 with a RKT $28 3/19 call today. Care to guess where that homemade stimmy is going?",1,0,1614719460,RamseyHatesMe

22,gpglz4b,"Nothing in your post says you don‚Äôt want to beat hedge funds‚Äîwhat if you didn‚Äôt have to gamble? What if the following was so large and organized you could obliterate or bless any stonk you wanted with your mates and make bank doing so? 

I was enticed by wsb because of the unification and buying influence, not because I wanted to share my gambling stories; Maybe I‚Äôm a big picture guy but that‚Äôs just how I feel. 

I don‚Äôt feel big posting a screenshot of gains, or get hard looking at other‚Äôs losses. I don‚Äôt look down on that kind of thing either, but I want something more‚Äî unintentional or not I know a lot of the people here do too. 

Call me an anarchist I guess, but we‚Äôre not going to get anywhere if you guys start ogling and promoting other stocks.",1,0,1614720230,Atsoc1993

24,gph230l,"This is a place to share information, wins, and losses among anything else stock related.  It‚Äôs not a buying collective. Never was. 

GameStop squeeze was forecasted by trends on charts and short reports along with value in the business. It was never ‚Äúeveryone buy to squeeze the hedge funds.‚Äù  

It‚Äôs not the only stock out there and you‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think people are still holding like you suggest.  

Also, if you are an anarchist, then this isn‚Äôt for you if it was a collective of organized buying and conformity. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be mean or a douche. I‚Äôm just pointing out some realities. 

I wish we could get GME to $1000, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the cards.  RKT is doing the same thing that GME was doing during the squeeze.  

It strikes me that a lot of people want to believe what they hold will fly again instead of get on board the new rocket.  üöÄ It just doesn‚Äôt always work that way. Sorry.",1,0,1614727770,ryan7714
25,gphbo75,"Are you selectively blind? You‚Äôre not being a douche‚Äîbut if I‚Äôm understanding this correctly..... let me get this right.... you‚Äôre saying GME is dead.


EVERYONE is holding GME, and EVERYONE foresees the magic squeeze. What you are trying to say (subtly) is to dive into the new stock, and leave GME to rot. I.hope.you.are.still.holding.shares.bro.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with diversifying but choose your words carefully about GME. Diamond hands all around you.",1,0,1614732685,Atsoc1993
