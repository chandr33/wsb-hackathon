2,gqiubza,Why would you have a stop loss if you are on this sub?  You know games have been played and they will abuse the situation to knock people like you out of the game.,26,0,1615429331,Peelboy

7,gqiul02,This shit is bouncing off the walls. Anyone putting stop or limit orders is just asking for it at this point.,10,0,1615429465,YimYimYimi
8,gqiulqy,Not a scumbag move if you‚Äôre the one who set the stop loss. Now if your wife‚Äôs boyfriend did it while sleeping out of fear you might steal hear back then that would be a scumbag move,8,0,1615429476,badnewsbearass

13,gqiuwsy,Because last month I lost a lot of money. I hadn‚Äôt set up any stop losses for that exact reason. Saw my account drop below 3k and I wish I could‚Äôve gone back and set up some stop losses to limit how much money I lost. I did it this time around and almost missed out on a lot of gains.,2,0,1615429641,69RumpelForeskin69

18,gqiv24u,The first squeeze I hadn‚Äôt set up any stop losses and I paid for it. This time I thought I could change that but I paid for it again. I‚Äôm just going to take the risk this time around,0,0,1615429718,69RumpelForeskin69
