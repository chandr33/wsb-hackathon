0,gqavz6b,"My dude... I FEEL YOU! I have an A.S., B.S. and M.A. degree. I have 10k in CC debt and 35k in student loans. I even eat Avocado toast and live in my mom's basement - in essence, I am literally the Millennial poster child. 

I work 7 days a week to pay bills and see my girl through school. Never lied on taxes, never got arrested and have never had a period of being unemployed since I was 15. Yet every day I realize more and more how there's no possible way this straight-laced lifestyle is getting me anywhere but paying off debt for cheap Amazon furniture I bought a year ago. 

This whole venture has turned my thinking around. My plan for the last 2 years has been to live off of $150 a week and use the rest on food, bills, rent and loans. I'd estimate how long it'd take to pay shit off and often it'd be months of living like a minimalist. After this, I see how this grind is a ceiling and I'm going to invest my money more often to slowly raise the barrier. 

I was considering paying off my student debt with my earnings but honestly, I'm going to take out what my principle investment is, continue to pay the minimum and invest half in to safe stocks, and the other half on slightly more risky stocks.",1,0,1615271399,PJkazama

We all bought GME. But when Juliana was gone I Renee and I turned on Jonathan and set his stocks on fire it was made of pumps. Then we shorted him. I feel really bad for it it was pointless. Then karma got me and Renee our whole stock market crashed down. Renee and I never traded from then on. I forgot how to get into a broker. My computer got a virus so we can't trade anymore.

You have a similar sentiment to myself. the garbage we learned the debt we carry and the fees we pay. raised in a post 911 trash compactor that managed to take 2000 years of garbage and shrink it into a portable device that replaced traditional child rearing and education. dispersed to everyone with no owners manual or warning label. 

I was born in 91. I was headed down the same path as you but the He economy taking a dump my junior year of college rocked what I knew to be true up until that point in my life.

My father lost his job from the bank that he started. He had recently closed on a contract for the sale of the bank with a 400 percent return in 4 year for each investor. It was what he deserved. 30 years in the business and 4 years as president CEO. He worked way up the ladder for the same bank. from teller to president. This allowed my mother to stay home and raise  three kids. This is the way the world worked. 

You go to school. You go to church. you work hard. You don't take shortcuts. you don't get greedy. 

 I remember him walking in the door to our home the day after being fired. He had the great idea of shaving all his facial hair before going to gather his things. I imagine he did so with the idea that he would need to get a job and wanted to look clean should he have his first interview in 2.5 decades. I had never seen him without a mustache. It looked terrible. He was unrecognizable. A shell of my father. I immediately informed him how bad he looked as was my duty as a son. he managed a brief smile but was only able to keep his composure until we made eye contact. I quickly approached as he dropped the box he was holding. I wrapped my arms around him and told him I loved him. not a single hair on his face to stop the tears as they poured down his face. everything I knew about becoming a man changed in an instant. 

I would come to the conclusion from that point on in life that I would make enough money so that I never would have to experience that moment with my son someday. I wouldn't settle for a modest salary and faith in the system. I wouldn't pump money into an education that had no proof of its value. These ideas soon piloted by rage as he gets fully fornicated in the weeks to come. Informed he would not be getting a severance package then being escorted from the property of his new job by the FDIC as they informed him that he would not be taking the position he had been hired there for and that his career was over in the banking industry for the role he played in a failing bank.

Yeah not kidding... 

&amp;#x200B;

blackballed from the FDIC for being president of a small bank that failed. which they all did when the bailout went to the big guys. It crushed any shot a small institution had a making it and was the end of customer service as we know it. The start of the age of fees, fucked up phone support,   and full staff of employees who couldn't give a fuck about your sign in problems cause they have rent overdue and can't make a their $600 car payment.

I'll finish this later but I came here to say. It is all in your control. You got to let go of money. Let it go like its has the same value of the raw materials its made of. Like you never had it to start and never really will. Cause that's the truth. You put it before your own happiness you will be chasing the feathers of a the very small amount of chicken in your McDonalds value meal you had in college.

I found the car business got what I was looking for faster than others. Hit 60k at 24 yo and 160k at 28. each year making more but finding more happiness. I took a year off. Did mortgages. Failed at it but learned how little money really effected my life. At this point I can walk into any city and make 5-10 grand in a month as a salesmen. Or 15-20k as a  finance manager. I had a proven and documented ability to sell cars in an industry that's due for a shaking but honestly very easy to get a job in. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want to make money go sell cars. DM I'll get you a shot. Forget everything you think about car salesmen and just go apply. Take a leap of faith and leave your shitty job that doesn't pay rent to give something a try that at least has the potential to pay the 60k that everyone needs to live a minimum comfort in this county. IT WILL make a Difference. It was the only amount that made a difference for me. Everything after had no effect. I cleared 200 last year and for what? I'm not even close to the rich levels I had dreamed of. maybe at 500k I would feel different but I don't think so. 

&amp;#x200B;

You sound like the person to me who at least has a family that could support you if all truly fell apart. But think for a moment what do you have to lose. Whats the best possible senerio in you and your girlfriends careers, Will it really make you satisfied? If you had to get a new place cause you couldn't pay rent would you actually starve to death in the street. Or would you adapt? maybe find something you love. A room to stay on a farm in Ireland that needed help and had a spare room. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 shares is all you were willing to risk.  Do you hear yourself? You think anyone made anything of themselves with 3 chairs. Go wipe whatever pennies you have in your shit 401k that is only your money cause boss doesn't pay for three more years and you won't touch tilll your sixty . 60 which might be enough to pay for the loan application for your only daughters first year of college. a year that probably cost as much as your net worth at its current trajectory. and buy as many little nuggets as you have. IF you lose it all you will learn you didn't have anything to start. Maybe just maybe you will learn to let it go and start to live your life.

My husband has a decent job, but because housing where we live is so expensive we have little to nothing to put away for savings or investing. I have about 22K in loans that have been in deferment more often than not because I just don't have the extra cash to pay them down.  The system is indeed rigged.",1,0,1615279154,japarker8

It’s like every other day now I see some post about “oh my friend died” or “the system has done me wrong somehow”

Y’all want to hear about some real fucking problems?! I don’t think so because you’re too busy thinking about yourself and “poor me”.

Don’t like something in your life? Then fucking change it.  Go look in the fucking mirror and make some fucking changes.  This is America for fucks sake. Land of a bunch soft fucking snowflakes now.

Ok, my rant is done.",1,0,1615279404,Upset_Tourist69
