Right now, everything seems to imitate other stocks of the same category and its rotating over and over.

Lot of swing opportunity if you have money to put in but i mostly have everything in an account I dont look much for stocks im confident in the long run. Here I play with so small amounts and get even more nervous so i cant imagine looking at those swings day to day.
