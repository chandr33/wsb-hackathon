4,gpjyo7f,"Because most retailers know the true value of money, how hard it is without it and how hard it has to be earned. If you¬¥re juggling with millions each day, drink sodas for 200$ and spent 10k on a suit you just live in a world for yourself. That¬¥s why many here donate to charities after they made big gains, they know the struggle and are thankful",1969,6,1614791973,HerrJemine123

Top Gun: Maverick.  Shit, I'd go see Fast 9 just to get the fuck out of my house.  Point is that AMC is set for an epic comeback.

88,gpkpu97,"Do you define losing $900M last year as ""doing well""? Even before COVID AMC was losing $50M+ a year, which is why they had all that debt in the first place and their share price was circling the drain.

Here's the real kicker. You put your money in to help WSB drive the share price up. The executive team then devalued each and every one of those shares you invested in by issuing more shares to bail out the bankers who loaned them money they wouldn't have otherwise been able to pay back. Then the executives awarded themselves $5M in bonuses for a job well done.
