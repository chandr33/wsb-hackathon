0,gqgqufy,"Been in LUMN since $11. I'm going long on it, dumping my GME money in it. That 7% dividend is phat",3,0,1615395577,manitowoc2250
1,gqgrj01,"Yeah and the dividend is solid given its cash flow and low debt payments the next couple of years, really should be ready to outperform.

I think the buying flows of the past couple weeks have been really strong there, (it was green 12 of the 14 days prior to yesterday), so there's a lot of value investors picking it up here.",1,0,1615395856,zg44

6,gqguqgo,"As someone who sees inside the inner workings almost daily. I'm gonna hard pass. That value is gonna become the liability in less then 12 months time. Mass exodus of technical expertise, volatile contracts like emergency networks they can't keep up on after the layoffs and early retirements of everyone that knew what was happening before... It's a repeat of when the old centurylink started to sell off all their old copper networks to rural telcos because they couldn't afford the upkeep.",1,0,1615397120,Thejunky1
7,gqh1ops,A fan of your DD's lately but you are way off on the implication of an inflation uptick imo,1,0,1615399440,Pak14life
8,gqh2uek,"Thing is, I think it's mostly just a valuation rotation to cheaper names (value names are just much cheaper on a relative basis) more than the real impact of inflation expectations at work.

Feels more like big investors were just waiting for an excuse to sell high flying names that seem to be pricing in perfection a decade out...",1,0,1615399885,zg44
9,gqh83j3,I agree with you there but I think as it becomes clear that a slight uptick in inflation (its super low still) isn't gonna change fed policy at all the impact on stocks becomes more muted. they want inflation to tick higher a bit and have already said temporary inflation isn't gonna change their decision making,0,0,1615401937,Pak14life
