8,gpk5enu,"Still, thanks to classic boomer mantras like maxing out my 401k, living frugally for my income, being content with boomer gains, and making good money as an engineer, I'm already on pace to retire in my early 50s, and I'm risking that for what? Yes, I'd love a 911 or some shit, but it's not worth having to work like a plebe into my 60s. 

Sometimes I feel like my views on money are so warped compared to everyone else. I got shit on for wanting to buy my then-girlfriend a synthetic diamond (not cubic zirconia, damn it) engagement ring and all of a sudden I'm getting chastised for not buying a real diamond and wanting to blow 10k+ on jewelry to show my commitment, instead wanting to focus on down payment for family house, paying off her debt, getting her a reliable car, starting a 529 fund for our future kid, etc. But everyone keeps telling me I'm the fucked up one. I just don't get money and its importance in life anymore, except I know I need a lot of it to get the fuck out of this rat race. Rant over.",4,0,1614794846,dj10show
