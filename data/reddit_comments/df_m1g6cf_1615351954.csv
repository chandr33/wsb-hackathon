80,gqexpin,"Obviously holding GME til I can pay off my fianc√©‚Äôs student loans, and cuz I‚Äôm young and poor I only have three shares so the rocket is appreciated. Honestly didn‚Äôt think there was gonna be this much massive momentum so quickly, I just liked the stock for the long term. 

Besides that, been really interested in SSYS. They posted surprise earnings last quarter, and while they‚Äôre still small, they are growing pretty effectively and with a market cap of less than two billion are sitting on $300 million in cash with no long-term debts. Nice moat in their ownership of Thingiverse. Only thing is I know next to nothing about 3D printing.

Also extremely interested in the handful of SPACs that are being used by space stocks to go public. VACQU in particular. Rocket Lab is an interesting company, being the only really successful launch company besides SpaceX and I‚Äôm waaaaaay too young and poor (right now) to be able to get into SpaceX. It‚Äôs something where I think I might buy like five shares of each of the space SPACs now in an account I never check, and look back in about a decade or two and realize I have a few million in that particular account. Still want to do a lot more research before committing any capital, but something about the last few days has made me feel like we‚Äôre really at the start of the future‚Äîthe one I was promised when I was a kid reading and watching sci fi from like the 50‚Äôs through 90‚Äôs. I dunno, they might all blow up, but if one becomes Weyland-Yutani then I‚Äôll be feeling pretty good. Well, my brokerage account balance will feel good. I won‚Äôt feel good when Rocket Lab is sued in 2064 for a mission that resulted in the deaths of almost the entire crew cuz they were fucking with some alien eggs.

Anyone have any insight into 3D printing, space stocks, or other deep tech stuff? Feels like these will be giant industries, just gonna take a decade or four to get there. Also, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

TL;DR fuck idk I‚Äôm going for some sci fi stuff and we‚Äôll see what happens",0,0,1615352107,Bellona123
