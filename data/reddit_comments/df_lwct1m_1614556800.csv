7,gpgm5i7,This rose today bc of a massive influx of buying around 12:45. It got pumped up. Imagine it will sell off soon with a short float 2x the size of GME and the fact that shorts most likely have already covered causing the rise from 19-29,3,0,1614720306,mr_anderson59

14,gpgnu8o,"Are you talking about the increase in strikes on the option chain? 

The one I was looking at only increased them to 50 and it was for March 19th. 

Seeing as the stock was in the low 40s at close, this volatility totally warrants the CBOE to add extra strikes.",1,0,1614721048,mr_anderson59

19,gpgoupf,"Nope. Shorts wouldn‚Äôt be covering their positions with small multiple buys that incrementally move the price up. It would be done with a large volume move and would result in a large spike in price.

Also, after RKT delivered good earnings, if any of these hedgies that were shorting had ANY sense about them (which most of them do), they would have tried to close their short position immediately.",2,0,1614721487,mr_anderson59

21,gpgpfko,"Probably, but this still has the dividend coming up.

So anyone who opened a new short position today either has to close by Friday afternoon, or pay $1.11 per shorted share

This thing was basically flat since it‚Äôs IPO 6 months ago while the rest of the market went wild all around it and they‚Äôve crushed their last two ER estimates.

Not saying the ‚Äútrue value‚Äù for this is $40/sh, but doesn‚Äôt seem that it‚Äôs $20-$22 either. Question is, when the exuberance wears off, what will it settle around.",1,0,1614721739,IWasRightOnce

24,gpgqcpp,"Volume today for the 36c was 148,000

89,000 for the 30c

37,000 for 35

25,gpgqrdr,"Highest volume on a single option trade today was for the March 5th 2021 24.5 long put @ 3342 contracts...

27,gpgr6am,"I bought around $20 months ago with the hopes of it eventually catching on. I think the initial Reddit hype after it IPO'd scared people off who don't actually understand it's a good thing when a company is successful and makes money.  
I don't have an exit plan because I intended this to be a long term hold, but I was also hoping (as a high target) it would reach mid $30s by year end. A drop-off of some sort seems inevitable, but I don't trust myself on timing it and trying to buy back in.",1,0,1614722509,clev3211
28,gpgr9fn,"I'm thinking $25-30. There's 100% FOMO going on right now and I wouldn't be surprised if it falls off a cliff tomorrow.  

There was 365M+ of volume traded today with an average of 12M and a float of 104M. Yesterday's volume was only 34M. Sorry, but that's not a good sign and only signals to me that you should've bailed today.  

Inverse WSB is 100% a thing now. There's no reason for shorts to cover if they didn't even bother covering for GME. Paying the dividend themselves is almost definitely cheaper than buying back the shares at $40+.",1,0,1614722549,OreoCupcakes

At this point and if it keeps going up, it's cheaper to pay the dividend than it is to buy back the shares.",1,0,1614722922,OreoCupcakes
31,gpgs62a,"I don‚Äôt think anyone would deny that FOMO is occurring, it‚Äôs really just when it will wear off.

I hate comparing everything to this, but alas, I remember watching GME for two weeks as it continued to rise thinking ‚Äúwell surely it‚Äôs over now‚Äù only for it to keep happening. GME had a 60% day on Jan. 13th, but the real crazy stuff didn‚Äôt happen till till the last few days of January.

It‚Äôs obviously just a gamble at these prices though",1,0,1614722965,IWasRightOnce
32,gpgslt5,That‚Äôs for every single trade made. I‚Äôm talking about single trades. And again if your going to look at that you should take the P/C ratio into effect.,1,0,1614723168,mr_anderson59
33,gpgt28b,"Well that‚Äôs simply not true. Shorts didn‚Äôt bother covering for GME bc there was nothing to suggest it had upside potential. And if people hadn‚Äôt banded together on here, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. 

Earnings and how a company is progressing play a big part for shorts. So after a very positive earnings statements comes out, it would just be stupid for them not to considering hedging their shorts immediately. I mean that‚Äôs what shorting is based off of, profitability of a company, or more so, lack there of.",0,0,1614723380,mr_anderson59
34,gpgta8q,"&gt;I'm thinking $25-30

Yeah, that's why I sold mine at $30. A little bummed for not selling at $40, but there's no way I can monitor stocks when I have to sleep",2,0,1614723485,JustANyanCat
35,gpgtiwk,I don‚Äôt even see the trade you are talking about. I see one at that strike for 1671 contracts. But I also see a multi leg 30c 30p for 3000 contracts,1,0,1614723598,Thanhansi-thankamato
36,gpgvfdb,"Just because a company has fundamentals doesn't mean people will believe in those fundamentals. Shorts are just a bet, another way to make money, doesn't matter what happens to it. People short blue chip companies like AAPL for money. If covering the shorts costs more money than paying the interest and the dividend, then they're not going to cover.  

Let's say someone shorted at $21.21 on Feb 3rd. During that time, there was about a 20% annual interest fee to short the stock. The dividend they would have to pay is only $1.11 per share. Why the fuck would they cover now at $40 or higher? They're not going to lose $18.79+ per share by covering now versus the $1.11 dividend and the $4.24 annual interest per share. They're better off shorting up to feed the FOMO and buying back to cover their old shorts once they make retards hold the bags.",1,0,1614724504,OreoCupcakes

41,gpjm3pt,"Yes sure hedging often happens. Shorts are often also a bet but a lot of times that bet is based upon company fundamentals and the fundamentals of the company. If GameStop had great earnings potential it wouldn‚Äôt have had 150% of its float shorted. Same concept for many other shorts. 

But what has happened today with the stock was exactly what I was talking about and was trying to explain.",1,0,1614786582,mr_anderson59
