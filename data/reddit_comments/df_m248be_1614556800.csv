9,gqhmkap,"My profits will go into tanger outlets. I have noticed more and more people I meet especially women who are starting to hate online shopping because it doesnâ€™t provide the same experience or thrill. Tanger outlets provides a mall experience but with fresh air. After covid no one will want to sit at home and online shopping I believe e-com will see a slight decline during normalization or life after covid for the time being. People want to be free and roam the world and covid has given people the opportunity to appreciate life outside the house and the internet. This is purely speculation but analyzing human behavior is not something that can be disregarded when doing DD. It is also a heavily shorted stock which is good news for longs, because it provides the company with motivation to exceed expectations and convert shorts to longs and maintains the possibility for a large increase in share price. Remember hedges want to make money quick so they wont short this company forever it is nothing like gamestop where bankruptcy was imminent if it wasnâ€™t for us dum assess ðŸ˜‚",2,0,1615408022,GangBurrito
