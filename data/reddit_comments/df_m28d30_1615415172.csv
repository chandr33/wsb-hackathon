19,gqi2xkx,"I wrote up a post on LUMN here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m225xd/lumn_lumen_technologies_should_have_a_lot_more/

Looks like it's trying to consolidate at $14 in an important channel.  If it breaks above $15-16; there's nothing stopping it from hitting $20-25.

Main thing I like is options are cheap and vol is low; way too low imo for a stock with that chart.

I'll be in the play until/unless it falls below $10-11 and loses its bullish structure.

LUMN will be a big beneficiary if there's continued buying in cheap valuation/high dividend names and away from high growth tech.",3,0,1615415209,zg44
