If this really is the bottom, look at the daily candles. The last 3 times it's tried to dump sub these levels it got bought up. The sellers gave up and are just buying everything back now. If you can't sell under this level you have to buy.

The problem with GameStop is it’s a brick and mortar store, which are dying out, and the market is saturated with gaming services, platforms, and online marketplaces. I still buy games all the time but don’t have any idea the last time I went to GameStop, because I buy them on the PS store, steam, xbox store, epic games, etc.
