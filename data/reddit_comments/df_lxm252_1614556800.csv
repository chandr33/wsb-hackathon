10,gpnpbn6,"I bought into $UWMC huge. The obvious reason is they are financially sound. Margins are up on 800%+ increases in YoY revenues. Obviously that won't happen every year - you can't go from 8 to 8000 employees every year.

Their main product is the proprietary tech (mobile app, backend processing) that they sell to local brokers. There's an overall trend on the buyers side of the market in people shifting toward local brokers/appraisers because _they know the area_. If you're buying a home in New York, you don't want Chase to send some random appraiser from bumblefuck Iowa. You want local people.

But the real kicker is all that tech enables UWMC to close deals in half the time of competitors. This is _HUGE_ for buyers and sellers. Nobody wants a 30-45+ timeline to close and it makes moving a real pain in the dick. 7 days to close was unimaginable before.

The company is growing well and they're poised to capture more of the local broker market through their attractive product offering. They've also grown purely organically, whereas $RKT just buys shit left and right.

This is not financial advice.

They have automated many time consuming processing functions, helping streamline their broker partners' systems. UWM is a huge sponsor and partner to the Association of Independent Mortgage Experts (AIME) which supports mortgage brokers through training, conferences, and advocating for fair broker agreements for wholesalers.

Their pricing is competitive and no one closes loans faster. There is a fervent and loyal base of mortgage brokers across the country who send the majority (if not all) of their business to them.
