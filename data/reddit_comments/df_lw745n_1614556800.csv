2,gpfmvmy,"The only way is to lurk and learn. Sort by new/rising/hot and get a feel for what’s garbage and what’s actually good advice/DD if you need to learn options/trading head to r/options or YouTube kamikaze cash. Start there. Then come back. 

Or learn the hard way like most of us. Lose a ton $$$ blindly following WSB then actually do what I said in the first place. Your call",9,0,1614705199,shrimptrizkit

9,gpfndks,Honestly man your post will be removed soon but before it does I suggest joining the other subreddit like r/stocks. Not sure what your level of literacy in finance but for general information about stocks and trading the above reddit will be helpful. This subreddit is more for memes at this point and if you are interested in getting into GME just a heads up at this point its more of a gamble than actual investing so do it at your own risk. Hope this helps,2,0,1614705415,Jealous_Object4137

13,gpfo0to,"First - NEVER USE MONEY you cannot afford to lose !
Second - always do YOUR OWN DD (due dillegence) when someone posts their opinion to see IF YOU AGREE ( we all do not agree with each other all the time) as remarks on Reddit are solely a starting point.

NO REMARKS ARE FINANCIAL ADVICE

Third - DO NOT USE ROBINHOOD as your brokerage ( or you'll be sorry...)

ALL REMARKS ON REDDIT ARE PERSONAL OPINION ~ INVESTIGATE",1,0,1614705698,Accomplished_Bath_42
