3,gqf3uyj,"I know Robinhood has gotten a lot of hate recently, but I think it has the easiest to use user interface, I use it and Webull. 

I think Webull has a better ‚Äústock‚Äù page for each ticker but the app can sometimes mess up the graph or freak out if I touch in the wrong place.

I know lots of people use TD Ameritrade or Schwab also.

I think Robinhood and Webull will allow you to trade instantly upon linking a bank account and initiating a deposit. I‚Äôm not sure with those like actual brokers though.",1,0,1615356644,painterjo

5,gqf44vy,TD Ameritrade is popular one and has ThinkOrSwim app which confuses me but if you become autistic enough it will help you.  They also have free training videos so you can learn about stonks.  They also have paper trading account so you could start with that. Its a simulator with fake money to see if your great ideas would work or not.,1,0,1615356865,MasterJeebus

7,gqf4cuo,Webull has great tools.  Robinhood is most user friendly.  TDAmeritrade has major index tickers on the main screen.  Robinhood perc is instant access at 1000 for free accounts and 5000 for paid account.  Good luck.  You might have missed the Pre-stimulus dip.,1,0,1615357044,Djrustik84
8,gqf4fc4,"I did this, fidelity is good. I was able to setup account, deposit  cash and buy shares in about 10-15 minutes. Plus you don't gotta worry about them lending your shares out because not only do you need to sign up for it. You need to have 225K worth of assets to meet requirements for it.",1,0,1615357102,0rphanCrippl3r
9,gqf4lfc,"Thr charts are trash and they force you to read FUD titles in the middle of their app. No thanks. 

I have an account on:
RH(closed)(trash)

Webull(RH but better)

Fidelity(hard to get used to but you can trust that ol chevy to alwsys start!)

Ameritade (both ameritrade and ToS are amazing)

E*Trade(my favorite mobile layout and intuitive as heck)

Once the dust settles I will be moving everything to E*Trade or ToS. Out of all of them RH is literally the worst.",1,0,1615357241,ShyLeBuff
10,gqf4s70,They're so solid it's almost boring. Love that company,1,0,1615357397,Bweeze086
11,gqf52x0,"Second this. I didn‚Äôt know about instant credit of buying power after initiating bank transfer, and missed out on $40 GME waiting 4 business days for money to clear on schwab. What a joke! (Schwab)

Fidelity had been perfect üëåWas literally buying after 20 min setup.",1,0,1615357644,dragespir
12,gqf550a,Don‚Äôt go with Robinhood whatever you do lol.,1,0,1615357692,JRskatr

Webull is owned by China
Robinhood is not trustworthy",1,0,1615357740,Hawaiibee

15,gqf5gxx,"I use questrade.  It was easy for me to open, deposit and start rolling, but I'm using a tax free savings account.  My bank tried to get me to have an appointment with someone for due diligence who was on extended leave of absence. ;-;  Depends on what you want for support and service as a brokerage.",1,0,1615357969,ladypups21
16,gqf5x27,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615358354,VisualMod
