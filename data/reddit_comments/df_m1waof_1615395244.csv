It was better to sell as high as you can and try to get in at a better entry.  Unfortunately I was looking for $30 and it never got there so I missed this.  But I truly believe this stock isn't worth more than $30 if the new management does everything way better than everyone expects so I didn't want to ride this all the way to the bottom.

But I can tell you if I had gotten in at $300 I would be dumping this right now and be glad for the opportunity.  It's not going to the moon, it's at the moon right now.  It might hit $500 before this is over but I'd be shocked.  What wouldn't shock me would be to see the price drop 50% before closing.  It might not but I gaurentee you if I bought even one share right now at these stupid prices that's exactly what would happen.
