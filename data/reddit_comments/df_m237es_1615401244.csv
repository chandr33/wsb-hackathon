1,gqh6dls,"Let's be rational and think about what to take away from this:

Most likely some one (or group, or groups) have been hoarding shares (actual shares or shorted shares) quietly for a while, then dumped their entire stock at the same time. The immense drop in price triggered everyone's stop-losses and created even further downward pressure.

Take away? This is why you don't put stop-losses on a stock like gamestop. Everything else you can, but expect turbulence on the rocket to Mars.",9,0,1615401245,ryaichu
