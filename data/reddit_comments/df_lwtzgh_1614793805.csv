I get your point but when making options choosing an appropriate time window maximized profits.

Looking at the building sentiment two days ago, it was a really safe bet that the stock was going to be very volatile yesterday. And around market close, it was $120 per $30 OTM call option expiring in April. Risk was mitigated by both time to expiry and buy in price.

At their peak, those were selling for 1200% of their initial value yesterday, and even during the dip they‚Äôre still worth more than four times the buy in price for them. But people who have turned it into their identity, that bought options when volatility was already at that increased spike- that FOMOd in- they‚Äôre generally pretty consistent about losing money.

Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre riding that train, not conducting it.

HOLY SHIT I wish people over in the GME thread would understand this. So many ""What's going on why is the volume so low"" and ""if enough of us buy in the dips we'll cause it to spike!"".

If you believe that the short percentages are still astronomical, if you believe the situation has not changed or even gotten more prolific, then you also must understand that the vast majority of shares are in the possession of high profile backers, hedges and other large institutions.
