5,gqjqexg,No. It doesn’t cancel volatility. It only prevents continuous falls,1,0,1615448577,SignalSalamander
6,gqjqex9,"Plus if you start the crash with the initial short, I doubt they are breaking the SSR rules by following up selling longs.  Your narrative was exactly my conclusion of what happened today.  Evidence of hedgies long positions at the end of business today suggests it could happen again tomorrow.",1,0,1615448577,aformator
7,gqjrhhs,"Isn’t this priceless? They are saying the shorts have all covered which literally no one believes. But the icing on the cake is they do not understand the underlying mechanics of the stock: bunch of dumb bored fellas on the internet liking a stock. 

Without a fundamental analysis of just how mundane my last year has been, these media outlets can’t really grasp the idea that I’m willing to lose my investment because I spent about $250.00 total this year on entertainment, so my normal budget can go toward seeing if this stupid stock can make me money. 

The important thing isn’t the money. It never was. And it certainly wasn’t about taking down Wall Street (what the hell do I care?). It’s always been about googling GME every 20 minutes and getting excited or laughing about how much it went down. Guys from work who aren’t even invested call me in the middle of the day gassed up for me asking if I’m going to sell yet. This is the deep f’n value we’ve been holding onto.",1,0,1615449271,AbuYussuf

9,gqjrrqo,I totally deleted this post already because I was getting weird messages from some pissed off people and I don't have time for that shit. But I want you to know that I see your response and I totally agree. Holding strong right there with you and laughing at every attempt to break us. Still as optimistic as ever.,1,0,1615449459,stevethepirate808
