88,gppcl9o,"Market Makers do not do that. What they do is hedge against options so they can remain delta neutral. If you buy a single call contract of a ticker you are contracting with a MM that you have the right to buy 100 shares of that ticker at the contracted price anytime between when you own the contract and it expires. You pay a premium per share to do so. You also may sell that contract to another investor.

What the Market Maker does is buy 100 shares of that ticker and sits on it until your option is exercised or it expires. You can sell your contract to someone else, doesn't matter. They hold the hundred shares to cover themselves in case that option goes in the money. That way the contract holder can get paid, but the MM that enabled the contract does not lose money because they own the corresponding amount of the underlying.",1,0,1614895034,Duke_Shambles
