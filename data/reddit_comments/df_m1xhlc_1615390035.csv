35,gqgd2n9,makes sense. I linked another url to our favourite ETF showing like 500k shorted shares and was downvoted to oblivion lol So your assumption is logical.,1,0,1615390044,Jjjijjjii
36,gqgd2mj,"I have 22 shares bought @ 246.80. I've set a trailing stop sell order with a condition to go active once the price goes above $290. The trailing offset that I set is 14.8%. The order has gone active, and the trailing stop is now at $259.01.

So, hopefully, this is just a way up, up, and up right now, and the dips, if they come, are smaller than 14.8%. As the price of $GME goes above $300, I may up the trailing offset to 15% or 16%. I will continue to tweak the trailing offset. If the price drops below my trailing stop, my GME will be sold with a little profit. I may use a grand to buy one April 1 $800 call, so if the price of GME goes above $1000, I will be able to make some money on the call, but I'm not going to be holding the bag this time. It's not about paper hands or diamond hands. It's about not being able to find the right crayon color to believe GME is going to 500K. 

Good luck to you all!",-3,0,1615390044,rozhasi
