52,gqgmtf1,"Isn't it just that people tend to put sell limits at significant/'meaningful' numbers? So like $300, $321, $400, $420.69, etc... this makes the price drop because a whole load of people are selling at those points. But in between there isn't that many people selling because why would you sell at $342.61 when it's likely to get to $350? Obviously this changes the more stable a stock is, but with something more volatile people aren't selling at in-betweeny numbers.
