3,gphqn3r,I'm a new graduate optometrist and I am checking this subreddit between patients daily. Definitely my most checked sub.,12,0,1614740427,Vikha_
4,gphrdap,"I was about the post something similar. I realize I have to start posting and commenting so people won't group me in the ""shill/bot"" account category. 

I know I haven't been here for long but I'm glad GME happened so I could find this sub. I see glimpses of ""what was."" I get the frustration for the seasoned vets of WSBs. I get a ton of entertainment from this sub. 

I'm sick of GME and my wife doesn't have a boyfriend but I can be as retarded as the rest of you. Lots of useful content here if you dig along with the laughs. 

Thank you as well.",20,0,1614740762,GMEgotmehere

10,gpht83o,"Welcome to your new best worst hate/love relationship/hobby. Ive been here since about 2017 and its been quite the journey in this sub. 

This silverback loves seeing the young bucks and fresh blood. It‚Äôs truly the wild west in here but its home. 

Many of us spend more time in here than most other hobbies. Shit, I still smoke so I can come out and read and get away from my nagging wife. Her bf left bc she talks to much.",6,0,1614741696,Will_I_Mmm
