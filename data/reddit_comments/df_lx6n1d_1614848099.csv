8,gpmwpyg,"Citadel is in the dumb money acquisition phase. The 3-cup ball swindle has 3 pieces. 1: make the mark feel like a genius by letting him win and playing dumb. 2: Wait till they collectively surge and push in their nest eggs and replicate their exuberence, then 3: stop them out by retesting a panic sell 180. It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit. The first hit is free, the high will be like your first attempt at heroin, you will be superman, it's the next 100 that will ruin you.",-6,0,1614849597,streetcleanermed

31,gpn0wi4,"Yeah, thatâ€™s awesome and what WSB is all about! I am not trying to discredit all people that found their way here through GME, Iâ€™m just saying the stock market and retail investing is so much more than mindlessly convincing each other this one stock is the One.

I started out here too and learned most of my trading by interacting with others as well. But it seems like my experience was more pleasant because the community was always discussing a few tickers, and I was exposed to a lot more scenarios where I could take away bits of information.

My problem is absolutely not with people trying to learn. I encourage it and I was genuine when I said I hope this whole â€˜movementâ€™ is entertaining to people. At the same time I really want to see this newly grown community tackle more than just GME. It may die, it may go up eventually, but thereâ€™s a shit ton of better ways to fill up the in-between time. Profitable ones and entertaining ones.",2,0,1614853682,SirWetWater
