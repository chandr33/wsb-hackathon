11,gqe97d8,"I think you have a solid model and let me tell you my theory on why your model is likely closer to true SI and not reported SI. 

They buried their fail to delivers in ETFs and through tricky options trades to throw the ultimate head fake that the squeeze happened at $400. 

They then secured a net long position and bought up tons of OTM calls they knew were being sold naked. Now they will release the kraken that is the true fail to delivers into the market (insane amounts of buying will result) because they are net long and this will roast naked call sellers 100x worse than they got roasted as naked short sellers.  This ends in a domino effect of liquidations and margin calls that drag the entire market down... likely ~21 days after 3/19 options expiry based on the DTCC and SEC / OCC regulation changes. 

This is all obvious, why do you think the laws are changing?  They’ve engineered a short squeeze / naked call squeeze on steroids like Arnold Schwarzenegger was on in his prime. 

This is more than a short squeeze. It’s a 100x leverage, picking up pennies in front of a steam roller, naked call squeeze now.

Ultimate hustler move here. Only a real hustler would recognize this level of of a heist. Strap into your seats boys and girls because this rocket is like nothing we’ve ever seen before and likely we’ll never see one like it again.",3,0,1615338152,Aaronsmth5
