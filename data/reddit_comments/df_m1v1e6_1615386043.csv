14,gqg4erx,"You could be dumb also. 

CPI was in line. Not good. 

The bond auction may do fine. But it‚Äôs coming off the worst in a long time. And the stim is about to pass. If you think rates are done, you‚Äôre a fool. 

That being said, market could go higher for next 2 weeks before eventually breaking lower again. I‚Äôm certainly no expert when it comes to timing.

What I can tell you is to look at the longer trend. SPY hasn‚Äôt broken the downtrend til it tops like $393. It‚Äôs in a tight range, but a descending trend. It‚Äôs going to bust out one way or the other. The auction today could be the the trigger. 

I just wouldn‚Äôt be so confident. Stocks have been going down for a month. And even if you think we‚Äôre in a rally, we haven‚Äôt even broken out of the downtrend we‚Äôre in.",1,0,1615386060,brad4498
