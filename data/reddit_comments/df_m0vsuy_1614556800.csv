12,gqa5nbl,"I‚Äôm confused, because I think you‚Äôre confused.

~$86.55 is $8,655.00. For one contract. Sure, you‚Äôre ITM, but at what cost?

If you have $8,655.00 to blow, I‚Äôd buy straight up shares and don‚Äôt mess with options at that point.

Also, keep in mind you don‚Äôt necessary need a lot of price movement to affect ANY contract. You could buy $200 strike calls expiring Friday and the stock could move up $2 and you‚Äôd still be in profit. Sure, not a lot, but you‚Äôd still make profit (if you‚Äôre selling the contract, of course.)

It all depends on if you plan to exercise the contract, or if you plan to sell it once you‚Äôre happy with the gains. If you‚Äôre going to exercise it, it‚Äôs not worth the premium unless you have stacks on stacks of cash burning a hole in your pocket because the moment you exercise that contract, you forfeit the premium.

Take that Apple example. You decide to spend $8,655.00 on the contract. It expires ITM. You decide to exercise. You just threw away $8,655.00. I‚Äôm too lazy to do the math, but is it worth it? I really don‚Äôt think it is.

Then again, it‚Äôs your money and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. However I think there‚Äôs much better ways to spend your money, especially if you have over $8,000.00 burning a hole in your pocket.",9,0,1615254959,Verrsee

16,gqa6n7q,"But you can buy calls much closer to the current price for way less money. Sure, you need the share price to move more to make a profit, but the point is to have the benefit of 100 shares for a fraction of the cash outlay.",1,0,1615255514,spinxter66
17,gqa7fxk,"So you buy a deep in the money call with a far out expiration for $8600. You can look at the other $30c options closer to expiry to see where the premium you paid is headed. 

That far in the money, the stock rises a buck, your option rises quite similar value X 100. It‚Äôs got stablity, but you‚Äôre still putting money up for it. 

The people that say go ahead and buy $8k worth of stock aren‚Äôt wrong, but they aren‚Äôt making the most advantageous play. You buy $8k worth of stock, you still have that stock. 

The benefit of owning the option is the ability to sell calls against the contract you own. This brings down your cost basis from $8k to maybe 4-5 by expiry and you‚Äôre able to make good money this way. 

If you buy $8k worth of stock, you‚Äôll only have 75 shares and you won‚Äôt be able to write fully covered calls against those. You can still write OTM calls if you have enough dough to cover them, but it‚Äôs got more risk.

This is all provided the stock doesn‚Äôt tank and your call is worth far less than what you bought it for. It‚Äôs apple, so not too likely though.",1,0,1615255952,checkycheckster
18,gqa7ubi,"What the fuck are you talking about? How is an option with an ITM break even a waste of money? He could exercise immediately and profit at that point.

21,gqa8y61,If you cared to sell covered calls just buy the 100 shares. If you are PMCC ing the fuck are you going to use an option that‚Äôs 75% of your cost basis for a delta that‚Äôs basically shares. It‚Äôs just a poor way of using leverage while incorporating an expiration that inherently adds risk with no real upside compared to just having shares even if less than 100,4,0,1615256773,Hank-TheSpank-Hill
22,gqa94lc,"1 üêí Weekly options are for the pros, degenerates, and pro degenerates.

2üöÄLonger dated options are better, I usually try to buy expiration date 60+ days out from when I intend to sell.. so, if I think aaple is going up to 150 in april, I'll buy June calls around that strike and sell them around April. This of course depends on how the stock moves until then, but the point is theta accelerates closer to expiration and expiring OTM is no fun. Give your smooth brain some runway for the call to get ITM. 

3 ü¶çThe strike and cost you posted puts a wrinkle in my smooth ape mind because autists can sometimes have reasons to buy deep ITM calls, but those autists have reasons for such things that escape your regular ape mind.

4 ü¶çü¶çWhy the fuck would you buy deep ITM calls where your premium is almost 3x your strike? So you can lever up from 30 shares to 100? To my autismos, there are valid reasons to do this that escape me, Im aware of that. Just buy the dips if you want to 

5 üöÄüöÄOTM and ATM are how you make tendies on calls. deep ITM calls tend to move like stock. And you don't get any dividends if you're positioning yourself with LEAPS. And you're cost basis is fucking wonky because you're premium paid for the call is is disproportionately Intrinsic value and not extrinsic. At expiration all extrinsic value is melted away and Intrinsic value is what's left over. If you're buying in at 70% the FMV, I wouldn't do that, but if I did I would just buy stock dips and average in paying attention to ex-div dates.

Edit: üöÄüöÄü¶çüíé last one,
If you're wanting to lock up capital on a long call like this, why not gain more exposure by buying closer ATM so you can get more contracts? 

What I've found with newbies is they think they can buy deep ITM calls because then they minimize their downside losses because they have a lower strike price. That's not the right frame of mind for a lot of reasons, one being that you're pricing in the trade going against you. If you are more risk averse and want to price in a trade going against you, use an iron conder or PMCC, or debit spreads, or any of the other risk mitigation techniques to do so. 

Buying deep ITM calls is not risk averse, it's just stupid outside of a more robust trading strategy. I eat crayons so I don't fuck with them, but I know enough to tell ya that if you think the price is going up but you don't have a price target, and you don't know when, go ATM further out then you think. The wings of Elon will protect you so long as your price in your smooth brain and give your calls enough time to get in the direction you think it'll go.",2,0,1615256870,prodigalHernia

40,gqb4lna,"buying very deep ITM calls is useful when you're extremely bullish on a stock. It allows you to essentially own 100 shares of a stock without actually putting up the capital to buy them in the first place. That way, you have your capital freed up to make other plays in the market. So, sure, even if the premium for a very ITM call is high, if you're bullish and things go your way, you will hopefully land at the break-even price if not higher, at which point you can exercise later. After the break-even price, your profit will move just as if you actually owned the stock!  
In other words, you pay a premium for someone to hold a stock for you while you can make more moneyz off your actually capital.",1,0,1615279227,FsPhys
