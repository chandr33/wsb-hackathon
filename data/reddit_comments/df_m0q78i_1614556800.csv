26,gq98h59,"Blah blah, blah blah blah blah....

Did you say hold Gamestop? That's what I thought you said. 

We all know GME is overvalued at $25/share. We don't give a fuck because the short interest is high and as the liquidity dries up, the number of exits are sealed. Some of us will be holding the bag, but most of us will walk with profits. Anyone who bails to silver will only watch as we double our money before the game(stop) is over.

Edit: if you really wanted to be on a non-meme rocket, you should have been in steel and timber in December when the market dipped. Both will outperform silver this year because the real bears won't return until the Fed says it's no longer party time, and everybody is sitting on a shit-ton of cash and there's a fucking building boom in the warehousing and residential sectors.",1,0,1615238065,overzeetop

33,gq98s0f,"I agree regarding SLV.

If GME is over or not I'm not sure, but I do think the upside to hold is there. The fundamentals are all aligning and the speculation is just absurd. So there's a lot of conditions to grow way further.

For the ones who can, SLV will have to go up at some point with all the hoarding from institutions. It's extremely undervalued now.",-2,0,1615238197,SirioBombas
