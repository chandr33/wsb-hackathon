46,gqeuktz,"Nope.  It's just a swap.  Think of it this way, they never put negative pressure on the stock price because they never borrowed and then sold the stock into the market.  In the same way, they also can't get squeezed because they don't have to buy back into the market.  I get why we wouldn't like this but it's actually super common to do for stock indexes, ETFs, etc.  It's a bit bespoke for a given stock so would likely cost more than standard shorting, but think of it as an insurance policy.
