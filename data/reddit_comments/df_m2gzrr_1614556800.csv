This leverage has changed the game. It will be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I‚Äôm not sure they even know yet what power they have.""

7,gqj6gw7,Not True. Every ETF with it is shorted to oblivion. They are just stripping it out of the ETFs so I doesn‚Äôt show as short interest. But peek the SI of those ETFs. It‚Äôs so obvious.,10,0,1615436250,KyFly1

18,gqjeq4k,"the author ain't stupid

yet he describes afterwards what has been posted here as DD by several really intelligent people.

By calling eachother 'retards' I think this is a classic example of an army (MM/HFS) severely underestimating its 'enemy' (wsb in general, dfv in particular setting this up)

You won't be underestimated from now on. Even when they'll use the media to describe y'all as sorry retail gamblers who should leave them alone in their WS bubble
