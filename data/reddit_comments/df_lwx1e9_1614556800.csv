29,gpjpjau,No not really tbh. I didn't quite grasp what he was talking about when he mentioned the lengthy licensing process for (insurance?) agents. Was it proprietary licensing through Rocket? I kind of tuned out at that part but he gave an example about a State Farm agent being a licensed Rocket broker. Anyone catch more about that?,1,0,1614788085,jsonne

33,gpjqji4,Great post. Agree will b next Amazon. Look at the tremendous profits and giving $1 for each stock dividend. Almost unheard of now. Buy the dip.,11,0,1614788517,peacock4444

35,gpjqpmg,I would honestly guess they won't start buying back shares until after the dividend. It can most likely help keep the price stable if people start to selloff post dividend.,4,0,1614788591,jlschwefel

38,gpjr6ev," This is a good time to buy the dip in my opinion. Great video and great leadership. Will be the next tsla w. tech side business and amazon w stonk skyrocketing. Yesterday there was a little dip and we started  new thread which pushed to 43. I think it will hit 40 today. this is not a stock we are only doing a short squeeze with. This is a stock that has factual backing such as:

1. They are going to pay you to hold. There is a dividend coming soon where you will be paid. I am holding till then and buying more. I will make $11000 at $1 a share which is huge on Friday. I bought 11, 000 shares. 
2. This is a stock that is making a huge profit. None of the other short squeezes had quarterly reports showing large profits. It increased over 8 million in last report.
3. There is a great forecast as the housing industry is going up big time.
4. Great leadership

This is the best and least risky short squeeze you will have.

39,gpjr81u,I also think that since management was public about hating shorts they will look to do anything they can to prevent a significant drop that shorts can profit off of.,1,0,1614788809,jlschwefel
