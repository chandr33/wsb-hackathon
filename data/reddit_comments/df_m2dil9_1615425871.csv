Pretty sure the dip today wasn‚Äôt the Melvins of the world. It was the sharks coming to eat hedge funds, and it wasn‚Äôt directed at us. They didn‚Äôt give a fuck about retail. 

The goal was just to dump enough volume to trigger the ‚Äúno shorts on downticks‚Äù rule tomorrow, so that the squeeze could happen for real. It dropped the exact amount it needed to for that, and then immediately went back up.

The funds who saw us yearning for the moon and decided to take us there? This was them gathering themselves for the leap. This was them getting hyped up to make the biggest play in Wall Street history.

This want a concentrated attack to fuck retail. This was a concentrated attack to remove the citidels of the worlds teeth tomorrow, so that when they battle, the bears are fuked. 

Evidence - even as the price plummeted, call options at virtually every price point were absolutely surging. Some fuckers bought 20,000 800 call options dated for this fucking Friday,  even as the price dropped from 347 to 199.

36,gqip2h8,"Ok. Devild advocate. 

Time zones explains first link easy. 

And second link is because *a lot* of stock market articles are in automatic mode. Lots of them are randomly generated when certain things happen. It's Like programmimg: (if) GME *falls* x%, _publish article_ #833

I'm not a programmer just made text look fancy. But it happens weekly when you see an article published by mistake, like when tesla is up 10%, article autopublishes saying it is on a tear, then it drops 15% in 20 minutes. Oops.  

Thats not what happened here obviously, but i think its possible this article was *indexed* ready to drop when certain standards were met.  It was sitting in the wings waiting. It was on autopilot ready to roll. We all know a large % drop was coming, manipulated or not.
