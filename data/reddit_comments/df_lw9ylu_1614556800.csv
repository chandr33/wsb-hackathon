11,gpg5nem,Yea it went back up but not as much. It’s my first call option (1 contract with a strike price of $32 for 3/5) that has gone positive. I did a few others for AMC in addition to the 55 shares I have but those call options are all negative for now. And I have four of GME. So far so good but it’s scary. Not putting in anything I can’t stand to lose but I see all the 1000% gains and huge profits from other people but it looks like they have more to put in for an initial investment so I’m satisfied with what mine has done. I’m trying to decide if I should do another higher call option on RKT or just wait with the one I have. Any suggestions? Staying strong! Thanks y’all!,1,0,1614713274,Fun-Storm-8721

13,gpg7jp5,"That's kinda how the market works, the people earning the most have the most invested, meaning, they also have the most to lose too. Percentage gains are simply that, 1% on a million or a hundred is still only a 1% gain, even though it ends up being way more for some than others.",2,0,1614714094,Smvvgy805
