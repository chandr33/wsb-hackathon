Second, the article doesn't make sense because the stock basically traded sideway, it lost 4 dollars per share ah shucks with a net positive vwap on the day.

Anyway, it was a good day for me overall.

Third, this was definitely a coordinated attack.
It could have been dare I say setup by someone who took the week off to create what they call fomentation. Sorta like a human shill bot that has their own tv show. 

Fourth, They forget that I have access to fundamental DD that makes it easy to diamond hand and basic trading skills.

Fifth, I am a BULL ON PARADE and I alone will be running a train on all the bears because I can stay retarded longer than bears can stay solvent.

I don't just like the stock anymore, I freaking love the stock!!!
