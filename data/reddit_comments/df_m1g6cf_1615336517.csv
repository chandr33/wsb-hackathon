54,gqe69tt,"Ok, go to the App Store and choose a new app. Webull has a nice user interface. Think or swim is more simplistic. Choose one, set up your account and transfer. Although one thing you should research before doing that is how long will the transfer take? Will u be able to access your account until it takes place? U don‚Äôt want to be stuck without access to your shares in the middle of the squeeze if or when it happens. I should probably include in here this isn‚Äôt financial advice. Either way it‚Äôll take u roughly 3 days to get another account set up and verified. Once that‚Äôs done you can request the new app transfers your holdings from Robinhood. I use think or swim and I have never waited longer than 30 mins for their customer service chat  representatives to reply.
