55,gpksxso,"The whole RKT thing was a dumb move by the hedgies imo.

Firstly, many GME investors watched what happened with SNDL, the other weed stocks and silver and are wary of ploys to distract from GME. I'm sure many big-brained autists (like myself) saw the P &amp; D happening and bought puts. The gains from those puts will likely go back into GME.

Once RKT crashes, where are autists going to put their money? Into GME as it will still be a better play. Those who made gains from RKT will transfer those to GME; those who lost money will try to recoup through GME.",1,0,1614805018,sugarbageldonut
