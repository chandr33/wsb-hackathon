A stock SSR'd can only be short sold, as the price rises. If it drops, shorts cannot be sold at all.

70,gqi7whd,"YES, the answer is yes.

Rest easy, and be ready for more of these same 'battles' over the next weeks and months.

The company is sound, what we are seeing is HF's trying to drive the stock down and drive investors away.

They have failed.  They will continue to fail.

They will do this more and more over the next days and weeks.

But the stock will continue to rise.  It's a good company in good hands.

I have done my DD and have invested a great deal of my own money in this company based on that DD.
