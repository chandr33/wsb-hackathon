15,gqf5936,"Let me ask this then as I do tend to agree with your sentiment, how much do you think the third largest mortgage servicer is the US should be valued at? I feel like long term it should be at least over 20 but not maybe 50-100 over the next 5 years. I don't think it should be as low as 8 but not maybe 15 by the end of this year. Sure it could see some pull-back if the housing market subsides s bit but it will pay a dividend and should be able to do that for years to come. This alone should have it above 10 don't ya think?",1,0,1615357787,LanN00B
