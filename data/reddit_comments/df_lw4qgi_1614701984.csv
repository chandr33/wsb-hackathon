33,gpffl9o,"The same mods who say 'no individual speaks for WSB' are the same people who unilaterally decide that a dedicated GME discussion should not be allowed.

Like, obviously the will of the people (pro- and anti-GME) is to have a dedicated space for discussion. So why do a few individuals go against the grain and decide against the popular will of the sub?

I'm assuming this irony is forever lost of them.
