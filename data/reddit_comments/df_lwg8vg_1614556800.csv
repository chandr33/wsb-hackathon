86,gphepr1,"I'm not sure if it's still the case, but _a lot_ of the nursery containers we use are made in Italy and it takes a long time to order them. 

Another note about the nursery industry is that other than the big boxes, which basically sell distressed stock, all the big players are private companies. Monrovia, Bailey, Hines, etc. There isn't much exposure to this industry in public companies.

As far as the state of inventory, most everyone is short on product. Pickings will be slim this year at big boxes because they buy the garbage that independent nurseries have already passed over. Those nurseries will probably have to lower some standards this year which leaves the big boxes with even less.",4,0,1614734270,pspahn
