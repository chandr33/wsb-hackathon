8,gpn8q54,I’m giving it a 30% chance it will run up after earnings today so I’m only buying a couple of calls before but if it does run it’s gonna hit $350-$360. I think they will definitely beat earnings though,2,0,1614860349,CandyLandSavant
9,gpn8vl7,yeah that’s how they get you. The first slice is always free and then your hooked on Costco,4,0,1614860456,CandyLandSavant

33,gpnhtig,"I've got some 3/19 $340c I bought on Monday, probably going to YOLO the last of my cash into averaging down today. Looking at the historical charts, it appears that IF there is going to be an earnings pop, it happens 1-2 weeks after ER, probably because there aren't many algos plugged into it. The key metric on valuation IMO is membership growth- that's where they make their money.

Also big agree, the one near me is ALWAYS packed. I am $10 family size pizza gang",2,0,1614865979,ethandavid
