4,gqh9wct,Look at the IPO number at open and thereâ€™s your answer,4,0,1615402659,LivinDaHIILife
5,gqh9zzx,It was an ipo. 45 was a guess of worth at open. But it opened higher. Cancle your limit buy and buy in at current price or wait for it to drop to get the 45 price. But what does this restarted ape know?,4,0,1615402702,thymetrip

The actual price it entered the the market was 64.13
Nothing wrong in your thinking. Thats just the way market behaves.",4,0,1615402725,hthadise

9,gqhahfy,"It ""opened"" at 45 but not enough people were selling at that price and too many were buying. Set your limits higher if you are certain you want to get on the train. A limit buy means that that is the highest you will buy for, so if if a share is being sold at a lower price, you will still buy it at that lower price. Good luck next time.",2,0,1615402901,UncontrollableUrges
