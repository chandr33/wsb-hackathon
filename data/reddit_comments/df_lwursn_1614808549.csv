Great earnings, great prospects and a great company. Yesterday’s occurrence was just a perfect storm of circumstances which came together for a nice and tidy squeeze. Without a doubt, I really like this stock and it’s a good value play",3,0,1614808580,MandolorianDad
1,gpl17d4,"I agree with everything except I don't hate shorts, I hate naked shorts. Regular shorts are a thing of beauty if they pay off and you make money whilst the market goes down. 

If RKT really was a ploy by the hedge funds then I thank them for bringing to my attention a decent stock with good fundamentals that seems to be run well that also has a high-ish IV for theta ganging (but not as high as GME).",1,0,1614808613,alexandrawallace69

This has a market cap more than 1B so meets the subs min requirement

Its the highest traded share today on yahoo finance

Its moving on news that the vaccine they are marketing has better phase 3 results than JNJ and AZN and also handles mutant strains better than the mrna vaccines as it is an old style whole virus vaccine.

Plus options trading just started up on it so heavy buying of otm options can cause a gamma squeeze. Its also being heavily targetted by shorts

So it is the quintessential WSB stock. But any post with OCGN DD is getting removed
