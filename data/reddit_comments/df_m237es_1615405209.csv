I‚Äôm an ape that just got into trading but seems like something that can be done to manipulate the whole stock?

Also if this is true it‚Äôs some real shady shit because now they have data on everyone‚Äôs trail sells and can easily do it again as they please. I‚Äôve also read here about the borrow rate...why is it so low? Thinking was that lenders don‚Äôt want the hedges to go belly up they make profits from them. So it‚Äôs in the lenders best interest to provide low rates because the hedge can convince them this is only a temporary thing and will die once they get rid of the FOMO and paper handers.

I‚Äôm in 100 shares so I‚Äôm riding the rocket but damn...and the media is trying to flip it and say we are criminals and we are manipulating..me a guy who works for a living and doesn‚Äôt have a huge bank roll can manipulate the stock in such a way? It‚Äôs really sad how hard they are trying to protect this entire process of shorting companies for profit and now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs exposed nobody wants to cover it?
