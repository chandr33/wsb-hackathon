73,gqgb1kh,"I think this is so important. Especially for something as risky and volatile as GME. If you're over leveraged, you're way more likely to dump the second the stock starts tanking. If you're truly playing with money you can afford to lose (not with money you THINK you can afford to lose, but in reality you can't), then a 10% decrease won't even phase you.

I can now admit to myself that I got way over leveraged during the first GME run up. Told myself I could afford to lose that much, but when I actually lost it on the run down, it crushed me and I got panicky. This time around, I actually invested what I truly don't give a fuck to lose, and the dips don't even phase me. By truly investing what I can afford to lose I went from a paper hands to diamond hands",1,0,1615389171,MoneyIndividual
