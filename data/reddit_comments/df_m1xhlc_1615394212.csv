51,gqgnd2o,"Anyone that has a stock can set a sell order for whatever price. So there will be new sell orders set all the time.

The reason why there's big amounts at certain milestones is that way more people are going to put a sell order at 300 than 302 so it's a large amount at that specific number. Some milestones will be big like 300, 250 etc. Some will be smaller and easier to break through but may still have an effect like 310. 

As long as the price goes above the limit price that you have set for the sell order will be completed. Unless there's a lot of them then others might be completed before yours.",1,0,1615394220,ConsentingInsomniac
