This of course means cutting losses and selling gme because the opportunity cost of holding is substantial, which means price goes down and angry bagholders become more bellicose, like a trapped animal.

I sold my GME for 3k loss (and down 15k from the peak); that sucked. 3k is like a month's wages for me except larger. I took the 4k from that sale and bought RKT on Friday, and now my GME loss is wiped out and I'm actually literally figuratively out of the rocket and standing on the moon. 

I currently have 9k in CSPs on GME and will the the proud owner of 200 shares if the price drops back to 50 (if not, I've bagged $1500 premium in 4 weeks from some put-buyer). I love GME. But I'm not a slave to it.
