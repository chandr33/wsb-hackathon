WE ARE CAPABLE OF PLAYING MULTIPLE FRONTS. IT'S CALLED DIVERSIFYING.

Maybe you shouldn't dump your entire load into one stock, hoping to get rich over night?

Don't get me wrong... I still have a lot of my portfolio as GME, and we're still in this together overall, but as I said...multiple battle fronts are possible, and just because someone suggests a second or third front, doesn't mean that's your queue to start REEEEE'ing ""hedgefund shills.""

I totally see your point here, it is a very difficult goal. But this is also *exactly* what people said about Chewy.
