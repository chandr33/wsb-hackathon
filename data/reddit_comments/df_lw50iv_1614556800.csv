P.s. too lazy to do a google search",1,0,1614700276,acppanday
4,gpfbzqv,"not at all dude. Literally can be another GME. I've been digging into this. The fundamentals massively improved in the deep sea rig industry, onshore drilling will be more restricted in the US under Biden. This thing could literally explode to $50-was 60 so easy and quick. Market Makers are massively short Gamma on this. They won't even know what fucking hit them. There isn't short interest like GME, but 571k open interest. If it starts to move they have to buy the stock to hedge, liquidity is poor as fuck, and it'll just drive the price up, creating a vicious feedback loop.",1,0,1614700399,fj94104

7,gpfe6w6,"Yes. It was overburdened with debt and after the price of oil collapsed the past few years, it got shorted the fuck down. Also, distressed debt players hedge the debt they had by shorting, and also keep selling puts, which suppresses the share price. When the pandemic hit, it narrowly avoided bankruptcy, now the fundamentals actually look really good for the second half of the year, and it could trade up to $10 if oil stays above $60. The thing is if it starts moving up faster, the market makers (Like Citadel Securities) have to buy the shares to hedge all the calls they've sold. If people simultaneously buy shares and calls, and don't sell their shares, it explodes up.",2,0,1614701383,fj94104

Got me interested to do my own DD into this

Thanks",1,0,1614701560,acppanday
9,gpfggot,"Most of the industry went bankrupt, over 50% of oil rig capacity was mothballed. RIG basically is the last man standing that dominates the industry and is the price setter now. If oil remains elevated, which it should as the economy reopens, $RIG literally flies.",1,0,1614702391,fj94104
10,gpfgmeb,Nope. Real DD on $RIG,1,0,1614702462,fj94104
