65,gqgject,"To the newbies out there....

If GME doesn't post 30% to 40% gains today, do not fret. No issues if it is not $800 by the end of the week. No problem if the squeeze doesn't start on the 19th; it's just a prediction based on data available.

You see the gains compared to last week. It means the big players on the LONG side fully believe in the stock as they are the ones driving up the price in pre-market as well as after hours. They are also the ones defending the short attacks.

So, stay calm and if, say GME is not breaking $300 by 10:35 AM today and staying at $285 to $295, then don't worry. We'll make it. All of us.",34,0,1615392681,blackrussian023
