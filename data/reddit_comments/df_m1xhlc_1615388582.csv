34,gqg9qr9,"No, I wouldn’t. Multiple reasons: 

1. It’s illegal for me to distill spirits. If I do it in small quantities and for myself, nobody will care, but if I start distributing the stuff, I can be in big trouble. I don’t have a license to produce spirits.

2. Whisky needs to age. If I make whisky, I’ll drink it in five to 15 years. So...this isn’t practical. 

3. I don’t have a license to sell booze of any kind.

That said, if you’re very interested in a bottle of mead, which is just fermented, not distilled, I’m sure we can work something out. I won’t sell it to you, but I’ll gladly share.

However, since the UK has left the EU, I doubt it’d be worth the money it costs to ship the stuff. Just saying.",1,0,1615388592,TheCatInTheHatThings
