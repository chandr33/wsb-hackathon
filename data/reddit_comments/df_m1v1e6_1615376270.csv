76,gqfpaee,"Hey, another Australian retarded ape here.

You'll have to set up an international trading account with a brokerage willing to trade in the US. I for example, use Commsec, because I already use the Commonwealth Bank for my savings.

Unfortunately, this can take a week or more to set up, and money takes a few days to reach your international account from Australia. I was lucky enough to get my stuff set up at $48 per GME. 

You have to fill out a W8 form and submit it to your broker as well, but they will probably mention this.

It's a bit of a process, but I can tell you I'm up almost 500% on my initial investment, so its definitely possible to make money, despite the clunky nature of trading from overseas.",1,0,1615376437,Says_Pointless_Stuff
