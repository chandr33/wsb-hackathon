1,gphlljy,"Yes the numbers are not artificial in a literal sense, that is not what I was trying to get across. These indicators just show that buying under them is typically a better than average price to what the market has expected. Similarly, When the price is above these indicators it indicates its over-extended and will correct back down.",11,0,1614737818,yodisc
2,gphm0u5,"If a price is going up a lot, the VWAP will be below the price, if a price is dropping a lot, the VWAP will be above the price.  


That's just a mathematical reality, if the price not matching the VWAP price meant it was 'Artificial' then 99.999% of all current prices for all stocks are Artificial",31,0,1614738035,EnderSword

11,gphot3f,"I like that indicator, thanks for the information!  Looking at it, the large bump that settled out also could be considered fake which means so was the dip after.  Hard to find good volatile stock indicators but looks good!",10,0,1614739478,boneywankenobi

17,gphptk4,"Based on indicators it’s very hard to tell where it will go, just indicate as the name would suggest. At the least I can say this strategy shows a correction to $124 likely tomorrow since these are short term.

For price $320+ I really like the Chewy potential DD that’s circulating. Worth a look. Don’t have the link on hand sorry. Basically says GME could reach chewy market cap with changes, that means $600 a share. Stocks with Bruce talked about this too.",15,0,1614740007,yodisc
18,gphpxwu,"There are quite a few bull indicators, the triangle some people have posted, cup and handle is where we are now as well.  Though those are pretty specialized - MACD and RSI did look good today but aren't nearly as accurate as predicting something this volatile in my experience (though the consolidation on MACD does seem to be quite the good sign)",4,0,1614740070,boneywankenobi

25,gphrl49,"I noticed the same shit. It’s very clear this is shorted the entire way up. Volume was relatively low for AH then we hit $120 territory and it triggered another sell wall of at least 10k shares. The wedge has tightened up here feels like a powder keg ready to explode.
