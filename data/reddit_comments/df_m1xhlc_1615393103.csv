This poses a conundrum for me: I want to get my tendies like everyone else, but I DON'T want the hedgies to benefit from my actions. Do I sell the contracts, or exercise my options?

67,gqgkkvm,"if the stock even comes close to, say 800 or 1000, I am 100% sure the SEC will step in to close all our positions at a pre-agreed price with the shorts. If not, the whole market will crash. So, fun aside, the 100k or 50k or whatever ain't happening. Also if all of us retards sell at the same time with no one buying, we will crash the stock ourselves. So, if this thing even reaches, say 600 and remains stable, it would be awesome to net some tendies. Even if it squeezes to absurd levels, most of us won't have the time to react and I'm pretty sure most, if not all, online brokerage won't accept limit sell orders, if they accept sell orders at all. It's a fun party, but I'm sure they'll foot us with the bill again. That said, I'm diamond handing my 7 shares as much as possible.",2,0,1615393120,DressMetal
