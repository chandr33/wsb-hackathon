Because 40% of the company is owned by us, retail investors.  Do you have any idea how rare that is in this day and age?  What do you think is going to happen when the indexes buy in with their billions (and as OP said, most won't have any choice)?

I'll be holding a while. With that yearly 4% dividend its just nice to get you know? And honestly unless it spikes/soars to 30 - 50+ I'll be holding on for years to come.
