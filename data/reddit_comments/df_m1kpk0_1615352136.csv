I assumed it would revert immediately. It was a Monday or Tuesday I believe.

51,gqf9abd,"A lot of folks here think it is still going to go up in the coming days/months. There is a cliche here ""This is not financial advice / I am not a professional."" We cannot in good conscience tell you to invest money you could lose. 

Investing, especially the way idiots do here can be risky. Most of us have lost money on investments, some of us have lost fortunes. Read up to learn - we call it Due Diligence (DD). Don't invest anything you cannot afford to lose. Be aware of the tax consequences if you are able to sell at a profit. Stay away from options (calls &amp; puts) and just buy/sell shares if you are new to trading. 

Last but not least, be careful/skeptical of what you read around here. Some of the posters are idiots, some are drunk and/or high, some are undercover here to gather info or spread lies, and some are just plain jerks.

Good luck!",1,0,1615361283,literallymoist

62,gqfbbg7,"THIS IS NOT FINACIAL advice.  My personal opinion is NO.  There is plenty of opportunity for this to continue for weeks.  That being said, this stock is VOLITILE.  In your position I would get in as SOON as possible before it skyrockets more.  Wake up EVERYDAY before retail trading starts.  EVERYDAY prepare for a DIP pre-market and at retail market opening.  With this volatility you need to be focused, you need to watch the stock like a puppy your afraid is going to shit on your rug.  It has the potential to make you fantastic gains,  it also has the potential to remove those gains in 1/2 an hour.  Its stressful but it is currently worth it.  You need to understand not to sell at a peak, and not to sell when you see a minor dip.  Volatile stocks Climb and Fall ALL DAY LONG.  What you are looking for is a constant gain through the peaks and dips.  Set a limit....say 500$.....If the stock is climbing then dips 200$ don't worry but pay attention.  If it dips to your (500$ limit) sell....ANY gain is better then what you started with.  Dont worry about what you COULD have made had you stayed in.  ANY gain is a gain dont be afraid to sell in your position.  There will be other opportunities in the market and you will learn on the way.  If you feel pain when you lose any amount of money be quick on the sell button to hold whatever gain you have achieved.  At the end of the day you gained.  I love volatile stocks.   Its stressful, but at the end of the day if I'm not confident in the stock, or other people's charts show warning signs I will take my 200$ and run.  Paper handed or not, the people here don't understand your situation.  Some people here got money to throw away ( can afford to lose ).  Take everything with a grain of salt and watch carefully.  Even if its 100$ a day take the win if you are uncomfortable and look for your next move by reading all the posts in here. I wish you luck.  Its a gamble every day, but do YOU, not what everyone else is doing.  Some people will take a 1000$ loss for the day on a stock because they have the DD that makes them confident it will bounce back.   If you are not comfortable BAIL! Read, do research and recommit into something that you are comfortable in.   At the end of the day if you come out with more money then you started you can not go wrong.",1,0,1615363176,hiking4000footers
