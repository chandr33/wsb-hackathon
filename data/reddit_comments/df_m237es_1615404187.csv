1,gqhdkt2,"Friends, fellow smoothbrained retards. I come to you in a time where some of us might be scared and worried about what happened today. I tell you this, NOT TODAY hedge funds, not today. 

You fucked some of us during 2008 and laughed at us while we lost everything. You took photos and drank Champagne and laughed while good average joes lost their homes. 

To this attack that happened today, I said good. You should be fucking scared, because when I fight, I fight for blood. I fight for a finish. My dad didn‚Äôt sacrifice everything so I would be a paper handed bitch. He did it because he believed I could become something that he never had growing up, stability and prosperity and wealth. 

To those of you who opted out of this, your job is finished brothers. Take your gains and go in peace. To those of you still wanting to be millionaires. LETS FUCKIN SHOW THESE HF WHO THE FUCK THEYRE FUCKING WITH. I DIDNT DO THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS, I WANNA BE A MILLIONAIRE. 

BE STRONG BROTHERS, HOLD. PREPARE FOR MORE ATTACKS IN THE FUTURE, ONCE SMOOTHED BRAINED APES, ALWAYS SMOOTHED BRAINED APES",50,0,1615404188,Native_NightHawk
