9,gqbr1ha,"What is the robinhood support email? I can't get in contact with anybody. I had to have the bank dispute my robinhood deposit because on feb 28th i initiated a deposit. They instantly took the money from my bank account. This was the same day they started limiting GME and other stocks so i cancelled my deposit. They never credited the money to my robinhood account but they never sent it back to my bank. So the reversal finally went through, but my robinhood account claims a ""deficit"" as if i withdrew the money, but that money was just the reversal they were supposed to process weeks ago at this point! I'm not standing for this deficit and all their auto responses and FAQ are useless! Fuck robinhood! But i need the support email",1,0,1615297412,deliverydaddy
