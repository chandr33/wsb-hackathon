Alternatively you could set limit sells at prices you would be happy with that last 60 days. Then you can sleep easy knowing you've already made sure you're positioned to sell at a spike.",7,0,1615235727,cosmos_jm

12,gq96473,"I do have a ton of WeBull and Fidelity alerts set, but for some reason they don't make any sound. Just pop up push alerts on screen.
