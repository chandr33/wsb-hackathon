You're right about reading giving you this information, but it sticks better and is easy to remember on practice.

7,gqccu2e,"I will say the comparisons to Blockbuster make sense, but only if you think of an alternate reality where Blockbuster pivoted and went online and bought Netflix. GME is doing all the right things it needs for it to go digital.

What kept me holding when GME went back down to 40 and I was caught holding 14 shares @ 95 was the constant faith in the stock on WSB, RoaringKitty's testimony and Uncle Bruce and his bagels.

Price dipped to 40 and I ended up having bought 4 shares around 75 and had no more capital to invest.

Was at a pretty big loss.

On the way back up I sold those 4 shares to earn back some of the money I'd lost.

Then I sold three more and tried to purchase at market open with a limit order. My limit order didn't go through and the stock ballooned by $50.

Now I'm here with 5 shares in the stock when I had 10 shares before. And kicking myself because thats like $600 I traded myself out of.

I panicked and fucked up, but im also retarded so there is that.",1,0,1615313148,Sir_Raymundo_Rocket

This has been exactly my same sentiment.  I had $10c in amc that I sold when it hit $9.   If I'd have waited..... there were much bigger gains to be had.

Compare that with the people from half a year ago, which were people that already had some experience and knew that they were doing dumb stuff all the time yet profited. So they were actually doing smart stuff...

57,gqddhqo,"These are the lessons I wrote down afterwards:

* Fundamental change in preconditions and assumptions - &gt; get out and reassess
* You can always get out, catch your breath and get back in (on the way up or down)
* Fog of bots and spam - &gt; get out
* Desire to get rich quick - &gt; slow down
* Don't take a side bet subject to the same overall bet
* (Buy the rumour) Sell the news
* Close weeklies and roll over
* 1month fds safer
* Cover downside with hedges
* You can reinvest gains on a slower/longer basis
* Think about what the gains really mean to you (eg a year of laziness, an insane vacation)
* Remember that this could have gone on without you
* Stay sober
* Forget the past. Donâ€™t chase losses. Every day is a new decision to invest. Take profits.
* Be wary of extreme premiums during spikes up or down. Let it flatten a bit and cool off.
* Use an options price calculator [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)",2,1,1615322778,MADE_WITH_REAL_LEMON
58,gqded2g,"Those are very reasonable, get it to the top!  


However, point 2 isn't the best? This more or less is what I did - my panic sells - which caused me losses.  


Add to ""Sell the news"" the term ""Buy the rumor"", just so people can properly google that and read into it  


""Don't chase losses"" is something that depends on the stock. I would add ""If there are losses, check news, and don't chase them if they get too much attention"" - but that's up to you. This point I'm vague on due to missing experience  


*And I would heavily recommend against options and futures with low amounts of experience as well! I've been simulating Options and Futures for weeks and I'm down a lot (on simulated cash)!*",2,0,1615323161,Awoolyx
