77,gqgc3jb,"**This sub and GME rollercoaster we’ve been on together is helping make me whole again after some serious depression late last year.**

I have no intent to pull out anytime soon to grab tendies, but I will say that with you retards this has event and ccommrodiery been *healing* for me.  We put our dog down in October 2020 - was crushed with depression - two weeks later my riding mower broke.. and my leaf blower, same day... then I got ‘the bug’ for a few weeks, was just an absolute shit fall.  Stopped going to the gym even, and that was my place of reprieve.

While I cannot bring my best dog friend back, I can fix my other problems like replacing my mower and blower with tendies that I just didn’t have at the time.  I’ve gone back to the gym and am crushing that.  This has been the right distraction for my wife and I to get our shit back together and snap out of all the crummy stuff.
