3,gqilohn,"Lol. What THE FUCK do you think is making the price go up?! It‚Äôs the same fucking thing. It‚Äôs not all the hedging.

How the fuck is this hard for you smooth brains to understand it‚Äôs literally the same dynamic as what‚Äôs making the stock go up $50 a day on vapor?!!!!

 I already did the math on the specific amount of puts you stated. . Comes out to 150,k shares that would have to be hedged.  It would have taken 75 times that amount of puts to counteract the share price so suddenly and violently. 
 Your claim the gamma hedging 150,000 shares caused the drop is retarded.

So.... genius.  Explain how many contracts of 250$ strike puts you can buy for 4 million dollars.  And then explain whether market makers gamma hedge ALL 100 shares of the contract, or less, and WHEN they hedge them. 

 Funny how you call me a beginner. Bit you don't try to discuss the math or how shit actually works, because either you don't know what I'm talking about which makes you the beginner, or you know what I'm saying is correct, in which case you're intentionally spreading disinformation.
