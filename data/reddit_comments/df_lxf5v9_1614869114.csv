All of that shit got a full measure of spite and an extra serving of resentment that kept me going for a while.

Up until this recent crash. I can say.. there is still a lot of life to live after losing a ton of money. 80,000 was life changing money for me, and was all of my savings from the military. I ate like shit and lived like shit when I was in, and just saved every paycheck for years, and when I lost it all I felt like I lost that much time. However, in the end I realized even though I lost it I still had the skills I acquired during that time. The one lesson I would like to leave with anyone is this. Stocks will go up over time sometimes a lot longer than you want, and you have to be patient. Second, do not ever use leverage/margin. Third, never invest any money you need right now. Pay your bills take odd jobs to make more money and take care of your responsibilities first and always.",6,0,1614870568,d3st1n3d

It is not a sin to invest your money...  If you look at the Bible: 1 Timothy 6:10, it says:  
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

So, it is not money that is evil, but rather the love of money...
