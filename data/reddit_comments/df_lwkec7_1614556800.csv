34,gpi6fud,"I have kind of a similar situation and portfolio. I started investing about 3 months ago. I had a full time job so I was making money, saving, investing. 

Three weeks ago I get told by the company I worked for for three years that I had to take a demotion to part time (40h to about 10h a week) or take voluntary separation with severance due to internal reorganization. I took the separation.

Now that I‚Äôm not driving an hour and change one way to work or GrubHubbing lunch to work on Friday‚Äôs anymore, I‚Äôve been investing that saved capital in to stocks like AMC between updating my resume and applying for new jobs.

This has given me the opportunity to learn from people from WSB, laugh at memes, cry at loss porn, and engage with individuals like you who have similar situations or circumstances. 

In short, I appreciate you and, I, also like the stock.
