9,gq69pmp,"They should move with interest rates, but they're going to make a killing on QE. If you look at the H.8 Data, they're heavy on bonds that they'll be flipping to the Fed at a high premium. These are just cheap dips for them to buy before the 30y double in price.

Especially when lending restrictions are high and consumers are paying down debt.
