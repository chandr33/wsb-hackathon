The same exact sequence of events played out many times over his presidency- Trump says something moronic/controversial/flat out wrong -&gt; defenders come up with excuses to twist his words to explain away what he actually meant -&gt; WH/GOP syncophants picks up the explanation and pushes the same narrative.

It's was all so obvious and overplayed that it's sad that there are still people who even now still fall for it, especially considering that most of time the most damaging evidence was Trump himself saying the things he claimed he didn't mean while on camera.

Rubio was a rising star, Trump will never break above 5% in the GOP primary, Ben Carson will never gain any traction, Jeb! was the clear frontrunner and would most likely win, Kasich being a dark horse that could pull off an upset, etc. I also got lucky by betting on Kamala being the 2020 VP way back in 2015 when she was barely a blip on the radar. That one made me almost as much as betting Trump would be both the nominee and win the presidency when he was at like 3% in the primary polls.
