6,gplqd53,"Yep and outsiders capitalize by seeing where the division is and exploiting it. They see that GME holders are worried that RKT enthusiasts might direct attention away from their baby and they just throw fire on it. It comes from within as well GME holders thinking anyone excited about a different play is some conspiracy. I saw a guy cutting down RKT on another board, looked at his post history, and he was knee deep in GME ;had been posting, literally, all day long on the RKT board ‚Äúsell this garbage‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all gonna be bagholders‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is going to $1.50 tomorrow‚Äù etc. I mean that just makes everyone look like idiots.",1,0,1614821553,Archibaldy3

17,gplt5n2,"Guess what, I bought GME months ago, and I bought RKT weeks ago.

I sold my RKT options today and kept my shares. 20x + investment gain.  RKT is an undervalued company, and I look forward to seeing it grow in the coming months.

What I cant stand however is all the cultist mongoloids on here telling me and everyone else we're not allowed to make money anywhere else. Guess what, there are other Tickers on the Market besides GME, and I personally have dozens in my current Watchlist/Portfolio.

I'm going to hold my GME with My diamond fucking hands till the squeeze happens, but until then I'm going to invest in whatever the fuck I want. The real Autists make money. 

Oh and one more thing. RKT was posted on Reddit  _literally god damn months ago_.  It had excellent DD many times over and it had _nothing to do with Hedge funds_ for fucks sake.

 If you can only afford GME then only buy GME but dont sit angrily with your tiny cardboard genitalia and tinfoil hat, screeching conspiracy theories at other apes when you literally dont even know what the fuck is happening in the world outside of GME. 

When GME goes interstellar you're going to have to find other things to invest in and god help you if you're not learning anything about the market between now and then. 

All that said...

GME to $42069. No stop set, No Limit set. See you in space.",3,0,1614822991,Bathroomious

Alot of times on some small cap no name bs, going from $1-3 or $5-10 or hell, .05-.08. I dont aim for fences. Say if its 1-3, ill set a 1k block aside and set limit buy at like 1.25. And just wait, in 2 days/weeks/months, itll hit. Then i set limit sell at 2.65 or so and wait. I am far from a millionaire. Mainly it gives me bs to read when im bored. But just randomly, passively, shittin out a few hundred bucks always seems to make my day. It happens, and i have got stuck, still holdin a few bags for years. But its made up for itself before that ""block of $"" got froze in time, it grew me a fresh block to play with. If that makes sense...im a half drunk retard from louisiana",2,0,1614830105,Trey-wmLA

88,gpmmhl0,"Ok. I took your recommendation and looked at GE, wow they are popping out if the ashes.  (I worked for GE Cap Welch/$100+ share days).

The is a 3/5 for $14.50 that was only .02 so 1 contract for $2, what do I have to lose?

During the day the chart moved and now the cost is .03

If the stock doesn't hit the break price of $14.52 then I get it, I just lost $2.

If before close bell on Friday say it hits $14.52 or over.  Its then my responsibility to execute the option.  If the stock keeps going up past the strike, im sure its more üçå üçå üçå üçå . 

I understand that in many cases like mine I dont actually own 100 shares so I immediately sell my option

How is the payout figured on this?  One video I watched said  you get the Delta which is listed at 089, less premium x100 so basically the contract would pay $8.70 since I don't have the shares to sell?  If the share price goes say a dime over strike and is exercised then how is the payout affected?

Help me in ape terms this part and I'll have a much better understanding.  I'd also again like to thank you fir yourvl time and GE recommendation.",1,0,1614840292,TheRealFinatic13
