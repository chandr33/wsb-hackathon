71,gqg01xo,"Hoping someone here will answer this even though it's a dumb question. 

I know GME is going to tank again eventually. I hold shares, my plan is to sell as close to the top as possible (I have a trailing stop in place) and buy puts on the way back down with the profits.

But I still don't quite have a handle on how implied volatility affects options premiums, and the IV on GME is super high (of course). So the question is, if I buy puts on the way back down, will the IV fuck me? Or would I not have to worry about IV as much during the crash? 

I'd ask this in the GME echo chamber but there are generally more reasonable people in the daily thread.",1,0,1615383759,KirokeHarper
