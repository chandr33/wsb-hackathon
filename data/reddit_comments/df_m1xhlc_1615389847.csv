I've got my eye on long plays that I want to make, but I'm not acting right away. I'm comfortable with sitting back and watching to pick up on patterns while I do some fundamentals research first. I made some short term moves in my initial excitement that aren't *hurting* me, but still serve as important lessons in patience through volatility (my entire tiny portfolio is all red except GME lol). All else fails, I have a copy of Investing For Dummies that I need to reread anyways... bought it a few years ago, smoked too much weed since.

How is it ""massively"" risky? Risky....sure. But at the absolute minimum, what evidence or DD is there that it won't reach its January high? Genuine question cause I try to conflict my bias as much as possible but I see zero evidence that it won't (again at the absolute minimum) get back there.
