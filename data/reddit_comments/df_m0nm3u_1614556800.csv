I understand the concept of options and what you're doing when you purchase one.

29,gq97avr,"Gotcha so, you bought it for 3.10 or 310 because it‚Äôs 3.10 x 100 shares. So the higher the price goes above 8.1 the more your call is worth more and more right. So because of the premium the lowest/most you‚Äôd pay for the shares is 8.10, because it‚Äôs a $5 strike plus the 3.1 premium per share to buy the contract initially. So, if you‚Äôre good at buying 100 at 8.1 you can exercise any time at or above 8.1 and have intrinsic value of higher market price. Or you can sell the contract, pocket some money, or buy shares of whatever with the profits.

38,gq9qmsq,"&gt;Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Don't know why people keep repeating this shit as if it is true. Without getting too much into the weeds, MMs constantly buy and sell depending on how close an option's strike price is to the actual price of the stock at any given moment. In this way they avoid the inherent risk associated with waiting until the last moment. MMs hate risk and thus hate holding positions for a long period of time. They profit off of small differences in bid and ask prices and have basically no need for risk.

No MM will be waiting until Monday fucking morning to buy shares for contracts that expired the previous Friday.

What's more, the MMs do not even need to necessarily buy shares *at any point* even for contracts that do end ITM. Because MMs play both sides of trades, they buy up both calls and puts, match them against each other, and ""retire"" both contracts, with no actual shares trading hands at any point.",1,0,1615246827,squats_n_oatz
