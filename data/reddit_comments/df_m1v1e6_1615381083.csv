Institutions caught with their dick in a Vice for selling more shares than the company has to offer, effectively promising to buying the entire company a couple times over at some arbitrary point in the future.  They expected to buy back at 0, but that vice got real tight real quick. Now a large and growing group of self proclaimed apes ü¶ç are basically holding to the gears to that Vice demanding $1000+ for their shares knowing they‚Äôre going to get it as long as they stand together and diamond hand the shit out of their shares.
