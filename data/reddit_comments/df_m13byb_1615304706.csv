29,gqcc5yr,"This seems unlikely to me. Unless they play some fuckery at $500 or whenever of course.

By the time we get to $500 it would result in a lot more buying to hedge by market makers, and literally every short would be in the red by that price point since it would be a new all time high. These would put further upward pressure which would further fuel itself cyclically, like the gamma squeeze two weeks ago.

Also I'm pretty sure there have been some shorts covering daily since this started going up, likely being replaced by newer shorts to some extent (lol to their folly). What the ratio is we can't know, but anybody who thinks all the shorts are hanging thight to their shorts all the way to wait until they get assfucked by a sudden squeeze is delusional. Especially those that shorted on the way down in Jan from $400 or $300, which are still largerly in the green, will run/have run for the exist with profits sooner rather than later.

We don't know what the real short figures are with all the fuckery that went on. The pre-Jan 140% SI itself may have been underrepresented, and now they're most definitely hiding as much as they can because the data being public is what got them fucked to begin with it. But this forces us vastly into guesswork territory.

It definitely doesn't feel like there has been much fighting to keep the price down for the entirety of last week, aside for little pushes to get it under some call option thresholds fast when it went above. Which my tinfoil hat finds concerning because if they're not even trying now, what fuckery could they be scheming next? Or the upwards pressure is too much they're not even trying now, between some shorts covering, MM heding, and longs FOMOing, all the while a lot of shares are held in diamond hands reducing availability.

I think earnings will give this a significant push one way or the other, depending on how they are, but they're still at least 2 weeks away and I honestly have no clue what's going to happen in between.

I totally expect the media to misrepresent the earnings to make them look worse then they are. If they're bad they'll paint them as the end of the world; if they're good they'll spend 2 lines at best about that and then nitpick on a slightly bad triviality for the remainder of their articles; if they're good with nothing whatsoever that can be attacked expect $ROPE to skyrocket.

Thank you for reading my sermon. Now while a bot will probably suggest I run for senate, I'll go back to my corner crying for not YOLOing at $40 because I thought it wasn't the bottom yet and that a new upwards movement would have needed some catalyst to start (instead the Feb 24 gamma squeeze kinda came out of nowhere).",1,0,1615306600,PestilentWarmth

That's just my 2 cents, but if I managed a hedge fund I would stay the fuck away from meme stocks right now.

When they do get called in the fund can go bankrupt but there is a chain of organisations who then become responsible for the short, which I think is clearing houses etc. This is the catalyst that can collapse the entire market.

Remember that a bunch of new shorts were most likely opened up in the 200-350 range and the pressure we see now will start to take effect as gme becomes harder to borrow and the margin rates go up.
