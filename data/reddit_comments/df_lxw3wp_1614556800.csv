3,gppjt2v,I like this DD. Longer options look reasonable with lots of potential upside.,3,0,1614898380,scott32089
4,gppjtby,I am a previous Gild shareholder and long time follower.  The stock is like Pfizer.  Trash.  You might get a push just for it to sell off.   It’s a scalp play not a long term.   It’s best days we’re when they were the only ones with the Hep C treatment.  ($115+) Sadly it’s only been downhill since competition stepped in (less than $85),6,0,1614898383,RandomDoctor

6,gppnsok,"That was over 5 years ago. These last few years Gilead has been going on a tear with a string of acquisitions. The catalyst coming up in particular, Yescarta, has outsold its only competitor, Kymriah, by almost double in 2020. If its label gets expanded, which it likely will, that market share is only gonna grow. While it may not go back up to its peak levels of 115+, a more measured expectation of 80~90 seems very reasonable mid-term.",5,0,1614900333,O_RRY
7,gpprl3p,"They were one of the big players in COVID treatment and look where the stock went.  ($84 —&gt; $63). I’m just saying, don’t get your hopes up too much.  I’m sure you might get a push back to the $80s eventually.",2,0,1614902251,RandomDoctor
