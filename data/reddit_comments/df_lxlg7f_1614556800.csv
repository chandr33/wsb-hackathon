67,gpnks4p,"PLTR bag holding has been a bit rough these past few weeks. Growth stocks are really struggling but I'm not concerned about this one. I wish I had a better entry point and had had more available capital for the current price, but instead I'm just happy to hold it. For anyone just eyeing it now, I think the current price is a steal. It's also a great time to sell puts. For anyone else currently selling covered calls on it and wheeling it, please do not get greedy and continue setting your strikes lower to pick up a few more bucks. It's going to fly up and fuck you just like it did me when I had 900 shares called away on its first trip past 30 in Jan. Keep your cc strikes high even if the premium isn't great for the next few weeks and you'll be happier in the long run.
