2,gqirfn4,"1) serves you fucking right for setting a stop loss. This whole sub has been telling you NOT to. 
2) It’s a moot point because GME bottomed out at $172 so your shares would have sold anyways.",23,0,1615427824,ConBroMitch

9,gqis0nb,"It sounds like you set a possible stop order instead of stop limit? There’s no way a stop limit set at 226 would execute at anything under 226 exactly. A stop order would trigger a market sell which sounds like the 233.58 number you saw. 

Now the 226 being triggered even though lowest displayed price was 233 is something else, although I’m fairly positive I saw us dip down to 175 at some point during the short attack.",1,0,1615428126,Dr_Crobe

11,gqise36,"Wrong place to cry to.

#1: Everyone’s been saying to avoid RH because of their shadiness.
#2: People here are telling each other to HOLD, but you tried to sell at measly $226?  You belong in stocks sub, not here.

And before you join stocks sub, learn the difference between stop loss and stop limit, else you will get crap from them too.",3,0,1615428318,ihavequestions987

13,gqislow,"It got all the way to $170. A stop loss just triggers a market sell at best available price. 

I don't like rh but this wasn't their mess up",3,0,1615428429,darksoulmakehappy

15,gqitpve,"Yeah, but if you do a stop limit, you’re not guaranteed that all your shares would sell.  It’s a tricky situation",2,0,1615429008,STONKZgodownonme
