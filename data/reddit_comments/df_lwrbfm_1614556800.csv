Feb earning- .17 EPS, repeat that in May, August, and November and you have a trailing EPS of .68. NOK‚Äôs PE ratio hovers in the low-mid teens. Take .68*14= $9.52. If you could increase NOK‚Äôs valuation to industry standard (basically ERIC‚Äôs valuation) to ~21 that price becomes $14.28.

That is all predicated on them repeating EPS success. If ReefShark really is the silver bullet for them, then it‚Äôs definitely possible.

66,gpjfq95,"Hi again. The problem with that assumption is Nokia will not earn .68 this year. Nokia has been a seasonal company and Q4 eps has been the strongest by far compared to prior 3 quarters in the past. 

Full year 2021 will likely have around .20-.30 Euros EPS. 

Otherwise like you‚Äôve mentioned, we should be around $15-20 with that kind of EPS expectations. 

Having said that even with .30 euros per share, we should be $6.50 or over. We‚Äôll get there quickly with a decent Q1 and positive guidance. 

Include the OM improvements to the Networks division and the double digit growth of Enterprise market, we are talking about .60 or more in 2022 hence my expectations of $15-20 per share. Remember ReefShark shipments are expected to be around 70% this year and every PP improvement to that will equal to higher savings thus higher EPS/share price.",2,0,1614783726,Sonerb81
