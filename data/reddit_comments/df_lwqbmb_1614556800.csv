Unless I go for an option in like January 2022, then maybe I'll go for a way higher priced option.",2,0,1614770510,SlackerFatChoy
13,gpiug1d,Not financial advice but if I had money that I could sit on Jan 2023 $45c and at an amazing price point at ~$730. We know PLTR is a long play and chances are it hits $45 EOY. If PLTR keeps gobbling up contracts and the balance sheet keeps geting better it could be some serious money but also a relatively safe bet. Catch is you have to tie up some capital.,2,0,1614770784,Senor_Cangrejos

16,gpj0o02,"Hi! Please do some more research before you start trading options :) sounds like you’re just buying a few- if you want to buy a few that’s fine but there’s a lot to learn!
You almost never exercise (not execute) an option early. You sell it. If you want to stay invested you roll it up to a higher strike or out to a later expiration. 
Also whether options are “cheap” or “expensive” really is a matter of implied volatility not dollar price.",8,0,1614775578,Verb0182

20,gpj6nz2,"No problem I get you, the benefit of a 30c June call for example is if the price rises and hits 30 in the next few months you have lots of extrinsic value or ‘time value’ left on the contract. You might expect to make 100% gain or more on your contract if this happens where the the percentage gain of the underlying PLTR would of only had a gain of 20% therefor making a greater gain than buying the shares. You could then sell the contract and use that money to buy shares or LEAPs as mentioned by someone else. Or if you are still bullish on pltr short term you could use profits to open up a new call with a strike further out. Or just sell for a tidy profit period 

If you are long on PLTR then LEAPs or shares are a good idea. If you are bullish short term on PLTR then your 30c June calls are good but I would sell the calls for profit down the line then reevaluate again as to what to do (new calls/shares/leaps) rather than exercise early.
