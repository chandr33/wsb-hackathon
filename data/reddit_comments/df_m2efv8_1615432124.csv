I had to tune in to Uncle Bruce' channel... and apes there helped...so I bought more. The stock's fundamentals alone is worth $600+ so it's still a great bargain at current price.

Then for some godforsaken reason I check my phone at the WORST fucking time today. Did I panic sell? Worse. I think I'm smart. 

Its dropping like a goddamn rock, but I'm still barely in the green. I'll sell now, and when it hits $100 I'm right back in it right? FUCKING WRONG. By the time my shares sell I'm out at $180. Great haul today. Made $30. By the time my screen refreshes that shit has already bounced back to $230. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Gotta buy in pronto. Can only afford 2 shares now, but goddammit I'm not out of this ride yet. Once again, by the time the purchase goes through I'm in for 2 at $270. Alright let's blow through the roof!

WRONG AGAIN FUCKER! How about we sit out the rest of the day at $250 huh? Jesus christ. Why couldn't I have looked at my phone 2 minutes later? Hell, 5 minutes earlier and I wouldn't have given it a second thought for another few hours.
