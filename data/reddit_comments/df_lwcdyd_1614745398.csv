Hope to recover my 5k loss on Monday as I had to sell 2000 @ 5k loss due to margin call yesterday due to short squeeze on a microcap :(",2,0,1614754283,readitleaveit

17,gpk6y8m,"Thanks!


So my one contract  never got filled, and now the premium is about $138 instead of the $10 I somehow got last night. I booked it after hours and it still hasn‚Äôt been filled, but I‚Äôm also still stuck using Robinhood so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.

I wonder if the app glitches, because the premium fluctuated from $.08 to $.38 or so and back to under .$10 when I bought it, so I wonder if that wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen.",2,0,1614795512,Bummadude
