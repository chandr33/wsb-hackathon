I guess, none of the individual parts of an ML/AI model are all that complicated, they're just stacked together in ways that might not have been feasible before powerful computers. A lot of the really cutting edge theoretical stuff is beyond me, though.

This is mostly just speculation, but to me it feels like the most logical direction is to be flat or keep going up, although it's hard to know how many new people are jumping in. Probably a rise up and a fall back down as people ""rush for the exit.""

I expect it to be extremely volatile intraday at the very least. 

In the immediate term my guess is there is probably going to be some downward pressure (I'm not 100% sure if gamma squeeze is the right term for it) as the delta on some far OTM options (the 800c has a delta is *0.02*!) decays more and more towards tomorrow.
