With VA legalization bill looking super probable it looks like $CCHWF could be a good buy. The way they have the regulations written previous medical weed suppliers are poised to profit the most off of complete legalization in 2024. Looks like $CCHWF is gearing up for it and they just scooped up a smaller medical provider in Maryland to strengthen their position in the VA market. Could net you some fast cash as more announcements are made but is likely a good investment for a long play as well.

Literally any green stock other than GME is a result of hedge funds buying up all the ladders at home depot and leaving them out front of local Gamestops.
 
In all seriousness, I laugh at the suckers celebrating their ""win"" with ""super duper serious stock"" RKT. You made 75% gains in a single day? Really? You *sold* your GME for gains before the drop like a *dumbfuck*, pumped it into RKT like a *fool*, and you think ""oh, look at me, I made a lot of money today and that's a good thing!""
 
Think again, bucko. I'll have you know that on the rare day that GME isn't lying motionless during missionary, my girl is dropping *as a trick* so that you money making paper hands get out, buy a new stock, and more than double your money.
 
You fucking morons don't see what's happening, do you? I'd laugh if it weren't so sad to see. You're sheep and don't even realize it. You think that being down on GME means I'm doing worse than you with almost 100% gains? You think I'm jealous with my 10 shares of GME @ 350? You think it bothers me *at all*?
 
We don't even *think* about you non believers in the GME thread. We care so little that we make sure to tell each other ""wow RKT is stupid"" or ""RKT is such a distraction I can't believe Melvin started paying shills with the promise of mooning RKT so when do we go up guys?""
  
I'm going to laugh in my dreams tonight thinking about how happy you stupidly feel to make a shit load more money than me today. Congratulations on forgetting that the only stock that existed before this week was literally Just GME.
