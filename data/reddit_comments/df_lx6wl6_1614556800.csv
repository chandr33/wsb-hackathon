6,gplkpe4,"This looks promising, gonna do some more DD and maybe start building a position. 

UNFI seems to be making only minimal profits or slightly losing money atm but a market cap of 1.59B vs revenue of 27.17B?",3,0,1614818285,davewuff
7,gplna0h,"Yikes. I own a grocery store and we use to use UNFI (Unified Grocers before etc etc). Horrible friggin company. Every order from them was a disaster. Completely disorganized. I watched their losses with us to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars with mistakes. Poor service. All of our good account reps quit the company because they couldnâ€™t take it.

The only reason theyâ€™re still in business is there are not a lot of independent grocery suppliers. But thatâ€™s a dying business as a whole anyways.

Up to you but from what I know of the operations run like the wind.",2,0,1614819885,HygrenEnergy
8,gplrl6d,Agreed! Iâ€™ve unfortunately been dealing with them for the past 14 years or so. Every time they show up itâ€™s like oh no what will it be this time ðŸ˜‚,3,0,1614822180,Froz3nMan
9,gplrrja,"So you have some details wrong. 

 Unfi bought svu which was formerly UG. So if you used UG it had nothing to do with unfi untill after the acquisition. 

Integrating their two systems (warehouses, employees, delivery drivers, unions etc..) in terms of ordering and fulfillment caused a total and massive headache. Those first few years totally sucked. We would frequently receive pallets labeled for other stores. Disorganized and generally shitty. This has changed in the last two years and things are running very smoothly. That's also part of why I'm yolo unfi. I have seen nothing but KAIZEN from them and they continue to improve.",6,0,1614822270,reddit_eats_tidepods

11,gpm2w03,"No, I donâ€™t have my facts wrong. We stayed with UNFI after the buyout and it didnâ€™t get better. I know other owners currently with UNFI and theyâ€™re still having the exact same problems today as we were when we bailed. Itâ€™s fine if you like the stock but I canâ€™t stand the company.",1,0,1614827847,HygrenEnergy
12,gpm9ld0,"Nice to get your insider industry perspective. Thanks for sharing! Itâ€™s like UNFI will become a monopoly given their large coast-to-coast coverage and dominance in the market place. I see UNFI as very undervalued given its financial position and earnings. Posts from folks in the industry like this give me comfort holding the shares. Options are another story, but shares never expire and can live on forever. Lots to be excited over.",6,0,1614831493,gpech
13,gpmgp0w,"Totally right here. Unified, to SuperValu acquisition, then UNFI acquired SuperValu.",5,0,1614835941,Wanderingirl17
14,gpmhfhm,"I think you may have a point in the Goldman comments. I think youâ€™re right on Amazon, I donâ€™t think they will lose them. 

However, QFC is a shiny penny, not a lot of product from UNFI, hereâ€™s why:

Kroger and QFC primarily distribute through their own distribution centers. They donâ€™t carry a ton of dsd product anymore. Kroger and especially QFC streamlined their product lines in the late 2000s to increase efficiencies.  Itâ€™s then that they started making better margins and profit. I was with QFC at the time.  QFC doesnâ€™t have nearly the selection they once had.",2,0,1614836448,Wanderingirl17

20,gpnr4qm,"Ye supply chain issues are not easy to clear up, I used to work as a supply chain management consultant. Having said that, it's not impossible to do with the willpower to really cut loose baggage (bad managers opposing change etc.) and I think there are things about the UNFI stock that could drive up that have very little to do with the fundamentals.

My 2 cents Position: threw in a few hundred dollars into UNFI shares for fun.",2,0,1614870562,biggusdeekus
