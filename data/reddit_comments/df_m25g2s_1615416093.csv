Edit2: It doesn't matter if it is at closing or (in the day) at the opening, as long as it drops 10%. Finra suggested the regulation the SEC proves or not and once it does it reinforces the rule. The SEC also made an extension to the previous Finra rule suggestion that is:

‚ÄùThe alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) approved today imposes restrictions on short selling only when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day. ‚Äù

‚ÄùShort Sale-Related Circuit Breaker: The circuit breaker would be triggered for a security any day in which the price declines by 10 percent or more from the prior day's closing price.‚Äù

So, if you side to bail out the elite over the little guy once again, especially after a year like this last, then I've lost all hope in our government and the future of this nation...

We cannot sustain with this polar lopsided dynamic, because without fair trade our market crumbles. The manipulation of the market by these HF's have been exposed, seriously the cats out of the bag, and people are peacefully revolting through GameStop. Most importantly, we have done nothing wrong.

My particular beef with it is that people in far off lands basically get shafted by it, regardless of their nationality.  So Joe Schmoe who happens to live in Korea right now because of his job automatically gets screwed out of being able to have a normal trading day on his time.

And why should New York City be the local time of the world's largest stock market?(Yes, I understand that it is the ""New York"" stock exchange; I'm saying the name is no longer a descriptor for it, but rather is vestigial).

see it makes sense because it has very little to do with GME. There are theories that if GME does go up, market goes down so SQQQ wins there (some days it does correlate, some days it doesn‚Äôt. Check it out). The other great part is that this doesn‚Äôt help fund shorting GME and is mostly speculative on the market crashing in general, which it most likely will in the next few years if not this one. 

So Don‚Äôt get your tard titties. If GameStop wins and happens to crash the market while doing so, I win double, if not, I get GameStop tendies as long as they don‚Äôt crash the market.
