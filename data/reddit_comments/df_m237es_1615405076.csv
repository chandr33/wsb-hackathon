Sell part of your shares to get even so you don't day trade back and forth. This day trading may dilute your gains and is simply not worth it considering where price can go to. Also. Daytrayding is what HF hopes for with those dips. You saw many posts here going from 4 to 400 and back to 40 all the way they held. Want to get rich with other fellow apes. Take example from them.

I think nearly everyone knows someone who has personally experienced hardship as a result of opioid addiction. And even if you don't think you know anyone suffering from this addiction, there's probably someone in your life who's functional and hiding it. It's horrific.

I don't think a ban is necessary, since CBD/weed/etc. don't work on everyone's pain (mine included, haha, fuck me), but I do think we need to look at alternative treatment methods and figure out how to support people struggling with addiction.

It's so shameful. I don't understand how someone can sleep at night knowing that they're being paid to shill opioids to a naive and trusting viewerbase.",2,0,1615405093,EmpathyInTheory
