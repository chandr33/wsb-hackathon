15,gqdeold,"You would have to pay an exhorbitant fee firstly, its something ridiculous like $500 per certificate, and it would take weeks for you to actually trade those shares to other people as you would have to mail the physical share.",2,0,1615323298,Tepllhcgftwhdg

I found one of the links, but I can't find the research paper:

21,gqdoox0,"It's a given that any system you care to think of its manipulated and controlled as tightly as possible by certain monied interests. It's fun that fucking GameStop, of all things, is shining a light into these dark recesses, but they will never, ever let anything jeopardise their hegemony. These people are literal psychopaths and they were bred from generations of psychopaths and they head hunt the best psychopaths to be their underlings. You can't imagine the evil that lies in the hearts of those men.

Fuck if though, yknow? Scum will rot, stars will spin, galaxies will collide and it'll all be over before you can blink...so fucking get yours now.",4,0,1615327746,Lazybopazy
22,gqdtuj9,Thanks for this DD! So insightful. I only have 2 GME stocks and I wish I'd bought more last week. Do you think it's too late to buy more now? You think there will be any kind of dip before it takes off to the moon or should I buy some after-hours shares in Fidelity right meow?,2,0,1615330189,WhyAreUtheWayThatUR
23,gqdu8xl,"First of all, I am not a financial advisor, simply a dude who likes the stock.

To answer your question, I have no fucking clue, it could go up, down, left or right and I would probably be wrong trying to predict it. My two cents are, there is no better time to buy than the present, because how can you predict the anything accurately, let alone the price of a stock affected by thousands of individuals+organisations.

That and it is only another week and 3 days until the 19th of March explosion that people talk about, and so I would rather be on the right side of this trade than the wrong one.",2,0,1615330383,Tepllhcgftwhdg
24,gqdvued,Sounds like a perfect buying opportunity with some profits back into the market,2,0,1615331169,BluntBeaver83
25,gqdwby3,You're exactly right... Off I go to buy more stonk! Thank you for the inspiration.,2,0,1615331415,WhyAreUtheWayThatUR
26,gqdwloi,"Anytime! if it helps, I have bought at dips and highs, my average is fairly low because I realised what the floors for the value of the stock would be, but I wasn't flawless. 

I think the main thing with GME (or anything in life) is not to maximise payout, but to minimise regret.

Do your DD, smoke your weed, fuck your hoes (or loving wife idk) and make your decision. Not my decision, not the subreddits decision, but yours alone!",1,0,1615331554,Tepllhcgftwhdg
27,gqdyfao,"This counters my arguement that causing the stock to enter prices that would call for liquidity in the trillions to be unreasonable.

Now i see there is a possibility that someone out there can spend that much to buy us apes our bananas.

Wouldn't it be easy to tell counterfeit stocks if the amount in the market exceeds that of the company?
For instance: if a company should only have 10 million shares but enough places show they own a combine amount that exceeds that mean there are counterfeit stocks?",2,0,1615332485,Psypho_Diaz
28,gqdyt33,"Yes it would be, and that is currently the case with GME and institutional ownership showing near 100% ownership despite retail potentially owning up to 50%+ of the float as well.",1,0,1615332681,Tepllhcgftwhdg
29,gqdz1p1,"Honestly, i was trying to find a short % and came across a website that claimed higher than 100% for institutional ownership and right under had insider ownership. I was confused but discarded it as it wasn't the short % i was looking for. I will look for it again and pay it here as an edit.

Edit:[yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

Edit: institutional ownership is 122.04% and insider ownership is 27.33%...... Retail ownership is high so what is going on?",2,0,1615332807,Psypho_Diaz
30,gqdzdmv,"IDK about any websites reporting as that is often fiddles with, but look for the Bloomberg terminal posts and you can often see instituional ownership in excess of 100% and that number will have been fiddled with as well",1,0,1615332975,Tepllhcgftwhdg
