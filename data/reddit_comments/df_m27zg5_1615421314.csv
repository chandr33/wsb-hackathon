In one sentence you say the big investors don't read Marketwatch, but then are surprised when I say retail is reading Marketwatch.

38,gqifahh,"**I‚Äôll tell you a tale called ‚ÄúThe Tears of the Bears‚Äù,**

**And how the warriors drank it by buying more shares,**

**Of an outdated company that once sold us games,**

**Millions were rallied, though I know not their names.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Brethren they were, as the fight raged on.**

**Days turned to weeks, then to months and upon,**

**One morning‚Äôs waking, the red field turned green,**

**And the end of the battle, or so it would seem.**

**But to stop fighting when your foe‚Äôs on one knee,**

**Is not the play when trading GME.**

&amp;#x200B;

**We bought more, and loaded the wagons full,**

**And replaced the donkey‚Äôs with a half-man, half-bull.** 

**We needed the strength to push and to pull,**

**All the shares bought from the paper-handed fool.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**And what was the name of this beast on the cart?**

**DeepFuckingValue, whose prophecy did start**

**the battle, he was there before the war came.**

**He answered the call when the Gods spoke his name,**

**And said to go and stand against the proud bear,**

**Whose rainbow flags now waved in the air.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And now he pulled the cart, as the enemy fled,**

**Their positions in crumbles, and tendies they bled.**

**They retreated behind stone walls in shame,**

**But we pursued, until to their gates we came.**

**The beast shed his cart and ran at the wall,**

**With a shattering Crack! the Citadel did fall.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And like a dam, water spilled from inside the place,**

**But it was not water, for it had a saltier taste.**

**Twas the tears of the bears who had drown inside!**

**Crying all together, they drown in the tide,**

**Of all the bear tears that together they cried,**

**That was the day that all the bears died.**

&amp;#x200B;

**We drank, o we drank, our fill of bear tears,**

**And to DeepFuckingValue we now sing three cheers!**",20,0,1615421431,oldcloudswhitepath
