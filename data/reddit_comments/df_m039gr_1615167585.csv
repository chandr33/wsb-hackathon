0,gq5xcr4,"I’m just taking a guess at GME. I know any business can have their goods registered to be delivered, but typically we think of food being delivered and customers are expected to tip. 

With GME merchandise, it changes the “delivery mentality” as to like Amazon or any other delivery system where you aren’t expected to tip. 

I could be totally wrong, and some people only associate tipping for pizza as the only delivery service worthy of tipping.",1,0,1615167623,0ptimusPrim0
1,gq5xi6v,"People are dying to go back to the old ways of commerce ( actually going out to eat inside a restaurant ).   Its an experience that you can't replicate with delivery.   By the time your food gets to you, even if its still warm, its never as good any more.     
If you ever watched Hell's Kitchen, you know that great restaurants time the exact delivery of every item on your plate so it arrives perfectly cooked and ready to be enjoyed immediately.    Gordon is constantly tossing stuff away and making them recook it because another portion of the dish wasn't finished in time / too early / ect.   Granted some of this is drama for TV but its also true.

So now imagine after all of this, your perfectly cooked dish gets to sit in a warming zone for 15-30 min to get delivered to you.   No thanks.

Also, unless you have free doordash credit from work or something, if you factor in all the fees and driver tip.   You're paying more to get food you'll need to reheat at home or have been sitting warm in a bag .. rather than eating in at restaurants and getting the full experience for cheaper.",1,0,1615167704,lampstax

There is somewhat of a “maybe”  longterm bull case for them if they have a huge change in business. but it’s currently propped up by covid sales and insiders who got in before IPO know that and will definitely cash out when their lockup ends. 

It might still recover, possibly even on the day of lockup expiration, but at least on Tuesday it will definitely drop.

48,gq65x3g,"Down 9.6% in the past week and 18.5% in the past month. It’s very easy to believe that a lot of this sell off is priced in (or at least half of it). They did well in earnings and with $1400 about to hit Joe/Jane Sixpack’s bank account, consumer spending doesn’t seem like it will slow. The economic damage of the COVID pandemic did not really ravage DASH’s primary customer base, middle to upper middle class white collar workers. COVID, and the (overstated or not) panic about it is far from over. The media seems content to wind up the public about it until at least June. 

Then we get into the interest rate risk. Everyone is worried that at some point the Fed is going to have to slow the speed of money through the system by raising rates. This “we are fine with inflation above 2% for some time” is political pandering by JP. They run a couple of consecutive quarters above 2% and they’ll be back at the table. But that’s not necessarily bearish on DASH. You could buy puts on ARKK and better ride out all of tech getting seemingly getting punched in the face with a rate increase. 

Of course, one expects a dip when a lockup expires. I believe that the potential swing for DASH may be a bit overstated. If you look at options pricing for puts, you still need the stock to shed quite a bit more value to be making real money.

There’s a few things I don’t get in the sheets (i.e., how are they sitting on a mountain of cash,1.7B, but still have a -1.2B book value?) but overall I have to agree with OP. I put the price lower based on net sales compared to GH, and I think GH may be a stiffer long-term competitor if the acquisition by Just Eat succeeds. I also agree that Uber and Lyft (which also has a deal with GH) will not experience the same pullback due to coming out of COVID lockdown. So, yeah, they have big challenges to face, in my opinion.
