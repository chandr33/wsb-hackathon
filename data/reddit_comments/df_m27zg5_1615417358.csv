So come on. I don't know what is going to happen. Neither do you. **And neither do the hedgies**. There are no guarantees. So enjoy the ride.

And if you have risked far more than you should have ever risked and a crash would cripple you, pick your moment and get out. Maybe leave a couple of shares in. Leave the rest to us. Bon chance",25,0,1615417397,MyDogisDaft
