9,gqebpvt,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615339499,VisualMod
10,gqebvwg,"Same as before. Be patient. Buy the dip. 

Iâ€™d expect a squeeze to be more dramatic. Might be hedges testing to see who will paper hand at what price points. Then they short it back down to lower levels as a scare tactic for more paper hands.",1,0,1615339589,alpha-zach

12,gqedcbp,"You have over 11k in profits from selling (not including previous profits from selling cc's). If the 200's get called away that's 24k profits, the 600's get called away that's another 52k, and if the 800's get taken that's another 72k. 

If you buy back the 4/16 800c that gives you 100 shares to ride up so you don't regret selling calls if GME moons more. But if it drops are you then going to ""miss out"" on the loss you just took buying it back? If it manages to hit 1000 a share that's another 200x100=20,000 - 2955 (buy back) = $17,045. Are you going to miss that $17,045?

Now if it goes to 100k a share, that's a whole different story.  **ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**",1,0,1615340362,kenkenster
