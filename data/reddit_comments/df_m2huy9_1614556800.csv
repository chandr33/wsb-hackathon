88,gqjdlzz,"I appreciate your time and effort putting together this DD, unfortunately there's one major criticism I have with it. When looking at the 1 day charts, you can see the pattern emerge that resembles the sockeye salmon AT FIRST GLANCE. However, if you get real close and use extra green colored crayons, you'll actually see that the pattern more closely replicates A CHINOOK SALMON PATTERN. The fundamentals are the same, but I am unsure if the detailed analysis will still work mathematically, so I'd appreciate some feedback and insight.

Furthermore, there are a few variables that may need to be taken into consideration. First, we must consider the concept of seasonality. If the salmon were in season, it may be likely that they are traveling upstream naturally as opposed to downstream. In addition, we would see a significant increase in impregnated salmon, thus our roe index would drastically increase. The roe index is INDIRECTLY related to the stock's MACD.

Lastly, I'd like to point out a potential fallacy in your logic, as we end up in an impasse. You see, following the classic bear-trap stockeye salmon trend, there's a fatal flaw. Stockeye salmon also attract the eyes of another feral beast. The cat. And who do we know is not a cat? DFV. So logically, this type of movement would attract a cat as well as a bear. Given that DFV is, in fact, not a cat, following this logic, he should not be attracted to this stock movement. BUT HE IS! His Twitter activity within the past few days has increased far more since the emergence of this nautical trend. Moving forward from here, I think you bring up many valid points, but it may be risky to incorporate the fish ladder attack in the off chance that the the F in DFV actually stands for feline.",2,0,1615440656,IkeaMicrowave
