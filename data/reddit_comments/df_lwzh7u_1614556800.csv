0,gpk2423,"Thor Industries ($THO) is the ticker typically used for RV plays.

Word of advice though, the whole boats/RV/outdoors (YETI, THO, etc) was hot for a while last summer, but it's already a pretty well known trade.",2,0,1614793438,KimchiCuresEbola
1,gpk62om,"Ya,  they are trading at an all time high, and it's in an industry that doesn't exactly Moon, they probably aren't going to grow a ton. More room for downside than upside given the people going back to work and selling their RVs on the used market, thus making people less likely to buy a new one.",2,0,1614795133,SuSpence11
2,gpk73yq,"I don't really see millennials or younger people buying NEW Winnebagos. Their vans are nice, but being constantly surrounded by vandwellers I have to say that most of the interest comes to fruition as 1) people custom building their own vans on the cheap based on used Mercedes, Dodge, and Ford fleet van models or 2) people with more money paying one of dozens (hundreds?) of van builder companies to build out a really nice and expensive camper van based on a new or used a Sprinter platform. I have seen maybe 1 new Winnebago recently, based on the Sprinter platform.",1,0,1614795579,th3t1nm4n
3,gpk7lli,"Everyone I know that got into RVing bought used. They have highly inflated ""list"" prices,  depreciate like crazy (more than a top-of-the-line GM luxury car)  and used ones are as easy to find as a discarded face mask.

RV mfgs are their own worst enemy with those crazy high list prices. Even a lousy negotiator can get 20-30% off when buying new but people who aren't already familiar with RVs don't know that, so many potential customers figure it's too expensive to buy new and that's one less potential sale.  Salespeople steer them to used. Good for the dealer, bad for the mfg.",1,0,1614795791,thatburghfan
