20,gployqv,"In mid January someone recommended I buy BNGO. Passed. Big regret. But last week when more good trial news - I think about Saphyr - came out they rocketed up and are now back to 9. I donâ€™t know what this stock has short term. Long term, yeah, Saphyr might be so affordable that these guys kill it on a leap

Important to note they donâ€™t sequence genomes. That would be insane for the price per test.

Iâ€™m so wary of biomed stocks after CRSP bubble but I think your earnings play calls are reasonable. $10-$15 is achievable",3,0,1614820839,ezrasky

22,gpmoho6,"In this market, it all feels like a coin flip since volatility is has gotten a hold of it, but I do think that tech is going to take a beating and biotech and several other sectors still have room to go this year.

Is it possible  that BNGO goes lower on earnings? Sure.

Do i think with all the good news there will be some run up? Yes.",1,0,1614841974,ElegantEntropy
