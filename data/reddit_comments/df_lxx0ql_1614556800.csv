4,gppgtuz,Don’t rely on teenagers on here who’ve been trading since Jan. 1 2021 with 100% portfolio diversity to tell you where to invest your money.  Read something like One Up on Wallstreet by Peter Lynch.  Do your own DD.,13,0,1614896962,yogipera

18,gppt73g,Get on your Google box and learn how to trade options.  Start with small money because I promise you're gonna lose a lot if you jump into it and don't know what you're doing.  Practice with little money and work your way up.  For the love of God though do not move on to big money immediately after you make your first big profit on a good call.,3,0,1614903079,Philip_McCrevasse
