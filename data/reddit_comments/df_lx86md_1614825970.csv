5,gpm057g,"It seems that the newest members of this sub has accumulated are awake to the reality that each ticker is in a very real competition for our naive retail dollars. Because the markets are so volatile and valuations so absurd, people are losing and making money by posting and voting on tickers alone. If they own it upvote, if they don't downvote. It has nothing to do with the quality of the content on here anymore. 

This sub is at its worst when people start attacking each other because they think that if you aren't with them you are against them. The truth is GME isn't against the hedge funds, it is the hedge funds. Most people on here are self selected money obsessives and gambling addicts so expecting them to care about anything but self promotion is probably stupid anyways.",1,0,1614826433,jamez_eh
