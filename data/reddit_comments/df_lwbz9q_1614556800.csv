7,gpgma5c,"I know doordash just recently bought the food technology company Chowbotics.  
I'm banking on them transitioning to more partnerships with large chains for ghost kitchens and automated technology to speed up service or pick up centers for multiple orders. 
Curious on your thoughts bc I agree that the current model is not sustainable with the razor thin margins restaurants have already.",1,0,1614720363,Joeschmo90
8,gpgmc43,Remember the lockout period for certain employees to sell stock ends on the 9th as well. This could drive the price down if those employees want to take their tendies and run. I  still waffling on buying some puts for the 12th myself.,2,0,1614720386,And-he-war-haul
9,gpgqgza,I think the cost for ghost kitchens and autonomous driving is an investment that would take at least a decade to pay for itself over just paying drivers and restaurants. Plus even if it works I'd rather just buy a week's worth of shit I can microwave at the grocery store for the same price as one meal made by a robot.,1,0,1614722196,No_Age8611
