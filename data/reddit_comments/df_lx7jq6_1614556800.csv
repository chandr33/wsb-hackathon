11,gplglom,"I never short anything but I go long volatility when the shit's really hitting the fan.  You could collar your position, sell a deep OTM covered call about a year out, buy an ATM put a couple months out, that's a net credit, spend the rest on UVXY 15.00 calls a couple months out.  If shit pops off that's kind of the best outcome if you're set up like that, and if you're wrong at least when you get assigned you lose your shares at a reasonable profit.  Something to consider

Edit: I tried it on AAPL, 180.00C Jan '23 would pay me about 1100, an Apr 120.00P would cost me about 600, and I could grab 6x UVXY 15.00C.  If UVXY popped to 60 those UVXY calls would have 4500 intrinsic value each, or I could cash in for a total of ~30k off my ~12k stake in AAPL.  Or, in 2 years I get assigned and lose my AAPL at 50% profit.  Jacked to the tits",10,0,1614816046,Bcron
12,gplgqs1,"There‚Äôs nothing wrong with liquidating everything to stop the bleeding. I had to do that a few weeks ago... it made me feel better, but it didn‚Äôt prevent me from continuing to throw my money into losers. I guess you have to liquidate and then ‚Äúpatiently‚Äù wait out the volatility... I‚Äôm incapable of being patient, unfortunately.

To mitigate that, I have 2 strategies when I‚Äôm struggling. The first is putting my eggs into multiple baskets. I find it better to spread yourself out into many small positions in various sectors when the market is like this. You only need 1 or 2 big hits to keep your portfolio green that day. Keep your position sizes really small and take profit when you get it (usually in the morning). This strategy ups my chances of getting lucky. If I have a basket of 20 stocks, at least a few are gonna pop on a daily basis. I had 2 RKT options yesterday that completely helped the rest of my portfolio. I wish I had more, but smaller positions in this market can work just fine. It allowed me to stay in the position longer than I normally would. And if shit hits the fan, it‚Äôs easier to exit a bunch of small losers rather than massive loss in a single name. 

2nd strategy is using equity instead of options. Will I still bleed out? Yes, but much much slower. And I can still find momentum names that move well and make a decent amount. Sometime I do a combo of both (many small positions plus equity) until market calms down.",5,0,1614816118,starfirer

Don‚Äôt listen to the sentiment, everyone normally hates bulls and I‚Äôm actually normally bullish. This is different.

I just commented in another post about inflation, but they say nobody is buying bonds right now. Simply put that could make things a lot worse, and I think that may be the real reason stimmy is being delayed.
