2,gpog4ef,"Unfortunately, this would be great if it were a normally shorted and retail buying stock on its first trip to the moon. However, the dynamics of the price direction have changed and will most likely exhibit the behavior of GME now. Looks like a good base has been formed in the low to mid 20's. Options will be used to secure their positions along with delta hedging for manipulating price. GME was pushed back down to 50 and traded there for at least 2 weeks before a sudden spike up to 200 occurred. Once this volatility subsided to a new trading range, then it's been held in the 110-135 range for almost a week. Will it spike again? I believe so. When and to how much? That's not easy to be determined now. It's merely a hold and sell when your attrition has give and are satisfied with the gains. Waiting for the ""short squeeze"" may be started from the combination of buy back, dividend, surge in huge volume buying, and another gamma squeeze. If those don't initiate it, then the probability decreases. It doesn't rule out some good gains from other jumps though.",9,0,1614881369,robertleeblairjr

Edit: I'm a dumbass, need to own it on the 7th or before. So tomorrow is the day. Sorry guys I can man up and say I was wrong. You're right, it's the 7th. Ex-dividend describes a stock that is trading without the value of the next dividend payment. The ex-dividend date or ""ex-date"" is the day the stock starts trading without the value of its next dividend payment. Typically, the ex-dividend date for a stock is one business day before the record date, meaning that an investor who buys the stock on its ex-dividend date or later will not be eligible to receive the declared dividend.

Base on your article: “The dividend will be payable on March 23, 2021, to stockholders of record on March 9, 2021, with an ex-dividend date of March 8, 2021.”

The ex dividend date is 3/8, if shares are bought on 3/8 those buyers will not qualify for dividend. You would need to buy before ex dividend date to be settle on record date.",6,0,1614883243,danielitsme

My hunch is someone tried to get the stock there right after open, when we plummeted to $25.38 -- just $0.18 shy of the goal.  When they didn't get it, they probably settled for buying back their stock and avoided the attempt.  Either that or a short decided to cover there.  Who knows?  That's definitely our battleground for today.  If we don't get below it today, I don't think things look so great for tomorrow.  I'm also new at this.",3,0,1614883990,userforce
