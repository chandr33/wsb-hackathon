0,gppnxwx,They only have to buy shares if they‚Äôre naked calls and the majority of calls are covered and those shares never see the open market when exercised. A contract buyer cannot know if the contract is covered and the contract seller cannot know if the buyer is hedging their own shares or just interested in the price swing of the contract itself.,0,0,1614900406,garthywoof

""Beautiful Volatility. What you saw just now with $GME $AMC is when a prime broker recalls shares from a client (e.g. hedge fund), the client isn't able to deliver, and so those shares are bought open market. Sprinkle in a dash of catalyst and a pinch of FOMO chasing.


Ryan tweet may have brought in volume but the buys were not overwhelmingly retail. They were professionally executed with a pattern of risk mitigation. This is trench warfare. The longer this goes on, the more time Ryan has to prepare his salvo of catalysts. Smoke them out. $GME""

49,gppq6of,"The answers you've gotten are all wrong or greatly simplified. MM's buy based on delta exposure and WILL buy based on the delta of the option in question. A delta of 1 for an option means for every 1 dollar the stock moves the option moves 1 dollar. When an option is well ITM it has a delta of 1. As a option moves ITM the delta increases till it maxes at 1 and moves exactly like the underlying (ie. 1 dollar move in stock = 1 dollar move in contract x100, plus extrinsic value based on the other greeks, like theta which is time value). As far as for a stock this volatile, I'm not sure. MM's may be more careful, but they're still not out to just hold stock around and lose money.

This is why a gamma squeeze requires a fast and UNEXPECTED movement up or down with heavy open interest all the way up or down. Otherwise IV causes options price to ramp up so fast buying drops off unless it's literally rocketing past strikes. Buying high IV you can lose in either direction without serious momentum. 

MMs try to neutral delta hedge. Therefore if for example, if there are 10x MAR19 200C that have a current delta of 0.2 (no idea, just guessing for the example) MMs will NOT buy 1000 shares (100 shares per contract x 10 contracts), but maybe only 200. However, as the 200C come more and more in the money then they will buy enough to continue to stay delta neutral. This means they may hold stock before the option is in the money and liquidate as the chances of it becoming ITM drops (ie delta drops), or pick up more until they own the entire amount of stock to hedge the option at a delta of 1 (in this example 1000 shares at a delta of 1 for 10x contracts). Finally, it takes a stock to be deep ITM or decently ITM plus close to expiration to have a delta of 1. Just cause a contract is 1 cent or even a few dollars ITM doesn't mean it will be delta 1. 

This is why a gamma SQUEEZE, needs to be fast and violent with a lot of outstanding contracts stepwise up the call chain. Any big gap will stop the squeeze. Gamma squeeze are rare because like I said, it has to be fast and unexpected, and a lot of what people called ""gamma squeezes"" have not been. The initial explosion had a gamma squeeze to kick things off and maybe the rise from 40 to 180 seen earlier this month MAY have been a gamma squeeze. 

Regardless, even if tons of open interest and a rising stock price don't SQUEEZE the stock it can still buoy the price and potentially lead to a pretty good run up.

I will say, it seems like if GME rockets there is a good chance of a real gamma again to 200-400, BUT there is a gap on the way to 800 (where there is another large ladder of open interest) AND we need a spark to start the rise.

Edit: I'm not a pro so I'm not sure if all MM's must do this or if it's general good practice or any other considerations that may run counter to delta-neutral hedging.",182,2,1614901534,FTRFNK

There is literally no way they aren't doing this - I mean, if you were going to do this for one stock, this is the one you'd be sure to do it on.  Still doesn't mean we don't have nice upside if the price keeps going up and the delta hedging continues.

Isn't put volume another consideration here?  Seems like the easiest way for MM to hedge is to buy puts.  Guy A wants 100 calls at 150, Guy B looking to sell 100 puts at 150.  MM completes deals with both, then remains delta neutral without having to touch the underlying shares.",1,0,1614901659,somedood567
