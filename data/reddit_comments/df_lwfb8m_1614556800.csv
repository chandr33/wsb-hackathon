3,gph100x,"Most posts I‚Äôve seen, have been about just people who had money in RKT, myself included, I put money in R KT back when it was 14 bucksAnd I saw explode today immediately sold it when it hit 40 bucks and threw those gains and everything it was worth into GME

5,gph17e6,There are thousands of stocks.  Every time another one goes up it‚Äôs not a gme distraction.  Lots of people called rkt last week for a lot of legit reasons.  Take your blinders off,7,0,1614727326,tech1983

7,gph1aaw,This made-up war with the hedge funds is the most delusional thing I‚Äôve seen on Reddit. And sometimes I read posts from r/relationshipadvice,0,0,1614727367,BigZard
8,gph1qh4,I have very little writing in this space but I promise I‚Äôm ape like you lost 12k two weeks ago on PayPal calls and tanked 3/4 my portfolio. Had to live with 10 shares of GME to start and a maxed portfolio outside of a few calls hanging out there yesterday and today I have done exactly what you speak of out of sheer desperation. I put my all into calls yesterday and was handsomely rewarded. I cashed out this morning and reboot the same calls and also plus upped 4 more shares of GMe bringing me to 14 total. Later today at peak I sold two more calls and bought 9 more GME shares and holding now another 1.5k for tomorrow to either go back in for more RKT fuel to get me to more GME tendies but why wouldn‚Äôt I? I think we are too quick to scream shill or bot. I get it I don‚Äôt trust much on here at times but this was the way for me and I will keep printing until it is dry but believe me I support you all (us all) apes and eventually when it dries up all my bounty is coming right this way. Went from 2.5k and 10GME to 7.5k and 23GME this is the way! I like the stock sometimes it is what it is... ijs,2,0,1614727592,shinarsos1
