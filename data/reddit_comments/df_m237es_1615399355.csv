35,gqh1guj,"&gt; Not a conspiracy guy

You should be.

Conspiracy literally means the idea that there are some people somewhere working together to try and do something, generally nefarious, because of the secrecy.

The CIA in the 70's created the stigma attached to 'Conspiracy Theorist' as a result of the general population finding the original documents and the 'One Shooter' Theory to be largely hogwash.

People act like the species that mastered Teamwork would _never_ work together to get more tendies. While ignoring the whole of human history and the _countless_ conspiracies that have transpired since Cain tried to cover up Abels death.",1,0,1615399358,Tsund_Jen
