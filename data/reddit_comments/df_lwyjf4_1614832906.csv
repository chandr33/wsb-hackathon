20,gpnwv83,Miss out on this DD when it was originally posted. Got in on the same yolo Call and 200 shares. Good luck and thank you.,3,0,1614873084,weechigo
21,gpnxuqf,"I bought on these reasons that came to mind, all speculative and may/ may not happen:
- natural foods on the rise, structural trend
- 21% FCF yield, very cheap in my book
- Constantly profitable (unlike meme stocks)
- Could be a potential target for an acquisition
- PE of only 8-10x (super cheap)
- Insider purchases over the last years
- Real estate value of &gt;1bn, potential sale and lease back = +1bn in cash
- Repurchase program of $176m available (6m shares = 10% of outstanding)
- 6x EV/EBiTDA, wow",7,0,1614873516,ProteusAxe

44,gq3qq0w,"Just be aware that earnings reports generally cause a dip in share price, regardless of good or bad reports. The ER is 7am Wednesday. So if youâ€™re going to play this, I would do it before or after ER. 

You could also buy in Monday morning, and close your position Tuesday before close to lock in profits. Then buy back in with the dip",1,0,1615130807,Buddha_is_my_homeboy
