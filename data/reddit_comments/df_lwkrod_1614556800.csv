The issue has been pushed (for better or worse) as a civil rights and justice issue.   The discussions when the 2020 More Act passed the house was that minority communities have substantially higher Marijuana incarceration rates despite equal use across all socio-economic lines... therefore, legalization is a justice and equality issue. 

 Believe me, it will pass.
