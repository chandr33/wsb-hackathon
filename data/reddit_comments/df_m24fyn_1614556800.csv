15,gqhrf4o,I've been following GM for some time.  They have heavy resistance at 57.  I gave up on my leaps (GM220121C60) I bought several months ago and sold at cost (7.70).  Of course this just solidifies the stock will go up.  You are welcome.,1,0,1615410074,fakeuser9999

21,gqkpt5i,"GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles.",1,0,1615472713,pinkmedmug
