It's got a 13% short float.  13%!  Those *hedgies* sure will be mad when you buy it!  Were gonna squizzle their squozzle amirite fellow apes?

Ha ha, yes!  Anyway, be sure after you buy to HODL until Noon on Friday, me and my other friends will definitely be HODLing until then as well and *not* unloading our position on Thursday.

And then, once you've gotten your tendies at noon on Friday, you can just go back to whatever other stock you like (GME was it?) and buy back the stock you sold, plus a lot more shares with all those tenders you printed!  It's called *averaging down* all the pros do it.
