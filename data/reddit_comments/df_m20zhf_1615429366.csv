31,gqjxw33,"I fucking hate hedgies fosho. Looking into some of these claims I'm very skeptical though. I understand no one here is rooting for hedgies, but lets think this through. If the short seller alleges that XL is lying on reports and inflating its sale orders on EV there are serious consequences to such a statement. 

If the hedgies lied they can be on the hook for market manipulation lawsuits out the ass. If XL lied they can be on the hook for a lawsuit of lying to investors.

What information do we have to go on that XL has not lied because quite frankly if anyone has more to lose its XL, if anyone has more to gain by lying its XL. Hedgies suck yes, but does anyone have solid evidence other than both accusing each other of lying?",1,0,1615453785,Siceless

33,gqk1imm,"Law firms don't give a damn about the truth, they jump on any opportunity to ask any shareholder who lost money to grab what's left of their money in order to make a case. You can see law firms piling up on almost every SPAC / tech / EV / space-related stock that lost 10% plus during the last 30 days.

If you think hedgies take any a risk by manipulating the market, why Citron gives a $60 target while Muddy Waters shorts it? At least one of them is wrong and should be sued in this case for stocks manipulation, knowing how strong their impact was. Do you really think it will happen? I don't. Because it has happened again and again multiple times during the last 15 years.",1,0,1615456667,edouardh

37,gqk32ga,"For sure the SEC is asleep hard at the wheel. All I'm getting at is that from a Utilitarian perspective, either the company lied to preserve income or they did not. Either the shorts lied about that or they did not.

Who does does impact most?

The company gains more investors, more potential clients, more public standing, more public valuation and so on if they lie. If they weren't lying they gain at best, preservation of their small EV market share with upside potential in many larger companies as fast as they csn manage to provide.

The shorts gain at Best airing the horn of known verified fraud or airing the horn about fabricated, non-existent fraud. Certainly in their case announcing publicly fraud is more beneficial because others could verify it and join in the short position, thereby making them money. At worst, they fabricated the entire thing against a very strong upside potential company with deals in major companies.

Don't you think it clearly (prior to evidence which no one has yet) makes more sense that the shitty hedge fund has less to lose than the company? Doesn't the company have everything to gain by lying?

Still disagree? Why aren't we seeing hedgies lining up to simultaneously short this company? Certainly if manipulation is the game, more of players in the same corrupt vein make for more gains right?

Certainly if HeGiES lied they have no threat from the SEC and at worst, domt get a spot back on CNBC for a while. 

What I'm trying to drive home is this. If the allegation is false, time reveals that. If it is indeed true then time reveals that. Wait 1 month, we'll have the answer garunteed. I could certainly be wrong and welcome that possibility.",1,0,1615457846,Siceless

58,gqkw53h,"Looks like XL is being sued right now:

  [The Schall Law Firm](https://pr.report/RErH2n4o), a  national shareholder rights litigation firm, announces the filing of a  class action lawsuit against XL Fleet Corp. (""XL Fleet"" or ""the  Company"") [(NYSE:XL)](https://pr.report/ATSLkx1s) for  violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission.  

 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading  statements to the market. XL Fleet pressured its salespeople to inflate  their pipeline of potential sales to artificially boost the Company's  backlog of orders. Out of the Company's 33 customers, at least 18 were  inactive and hadn't placed orders since 2019. The Company's technology  benefits were overstated, offering fleet savings of only 5% to 10%.  Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and  materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market  learned the truth about XL Fleet, investors suffered damages.",1,0,1615475717,curunir

Make a vehicle run on water and now your talking but they are doing nothing original and don't have the capital to scale production for maximum profit margins. it's just not that great of a product either. Not to mention it sounds like you have to spend money to retrofit your vehicle to produce 25% less carbon.
