85,gqeatfw,"I‚Äôll have to locate the sturdy DD for you, but basically at this point we name our own price. How? Because hedge funds shorted way more shares than exist. Eventually, they HAVE to buy back these shares multiple times over, and every time they do, they drive the price up. It‚Äôs compounded too. You add this simple fact with all the people holding on to these shares (making them more scarce, which is basic supply and demand), FOMO (fear of missing out) causing more people to jump on the train buying up more shares as the price increases, AND the options chain, which is a whole other Pandora‚Äôs Box I‚Äôm too dumb to explain. It‚Äôs just a perfect storm. Really, a PERFECT storm that will never happen again, most likely. All in all, the longer you hold, the higher the price goes.
