9,gpfozcu,"I got mine in already too, if you hit submit manually online as soon as it opened you actually submitted before all the people who filed early. 

All the major tax services decided to submit you tax filings at midnight of opening day rather than 12:01 in the morning of opening day. I submitted mine during the day so it got sent before everyone else who filed early and just checked the box to have them send it in automatically.",2,0,1614706114,TheFondestComb
