3,gqj4on1,"Terminology and exact types of orders vary by broker, but basically it's a way to set conditions that if the stock falls some amount from the last high, then sell.


However, the risk with this type of thing is that you aren't placing an order on the exchange order books with a guaranteed price - you're telling your broker's system to create an order once the conditions are met, and depending on the speed of your broker, this can royally fuck you (especially for stuff like GME where retail is playing against institutions with high-speed algorithmic trading capabilities).



I got dumped out of the first GME spike in January at ~$270 using this type of protective order. I'm still ok with that, I made $20k on it and got out before the retail brokers forced buying halts.",2,0,1615435126,lnslnsu
