5,gqglo2n,100k is the floor and it'll likely go higher. Anyone selling @1k when it gets there is likely to be FUD given that it will be the hedges last chance to salvage their position. They will likely be unable to afford to short substantially at that point but will be counting on you to be their substitute by selling. WSB allows loss and gain porn liberally so that'll be where they'll make their attack. 💎 ✋,15,0,1615393547,TriglycerideRancher
