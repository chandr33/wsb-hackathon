11,gpib5vb,"This whole chip crisis is fake as hell. Automakers account for 3-5% of total chips produced. And none of the execes in these automobile companies know shit about how they are used as they come as a combined product from suppliers. When Covid hit, they used loopholes in agreements and returned/not used combined parts in general causing a backlash and chip shortage for themselves over next months starting dec. There is demand for sure but level of shortage portrayed in media is fake and especially from automakers side.",3,0,1614753041,shyrambo

Itâ€™s all about value and making money. So I expect stagnation for quite some time with AMD being one of those stocks.",1,0,1614786016,Ahhhgghghg
