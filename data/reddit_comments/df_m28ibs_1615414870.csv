That wasn't a stop-loss sell off - if it was you would have seen waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay bigger volume.  That was someone injecting a huge chunk of shares into the market all at once.  Looks to about around 2 million or so followed by a major correction.

Either a big player cashed out their stake, or someone took a big short position.

My bet is on a big cash-out.  If there were posted buys for everything from 340 down to 180, then this person could have averaged around 240, and pulled almost $500,000,000 out of the market.  Someone took their tendies and ran away.",8,0,1615417133,DingusSwarm

Their attacks come in the form of shorting even further, but they don't have to have shares to sell, they've been creating synthetic shares (if you read ""fake"", ""counterfeit"", congrats, you have a brain). There are more outstanding shares than there are genuine shares.

It's bad for them that they can barely scrape together the funds to short the volume they've been shorting. It's not bad for us at all. We just keep being offered shares for cheap, and buying them. Their objective isn't to sell us cheap shares, it's to make us all *panic* over the falling price, and try to cut our losses by selling (which would lower the price further, creating more panic, and more selling, more panic, etc). The low volume is great, because hardly anyone has to buy those cheap shares to drive the price back up.
