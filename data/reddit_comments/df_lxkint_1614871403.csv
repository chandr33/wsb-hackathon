It's triggered when a stock falls at least 10% within one trading day. There's POTENTIAL for it to help price increase, but seeing as how the laws and fundamentals aren't applying to GME right now the SSR might not make any difference.

Working theory is this was some unidentified institution or whale shorting 100k shares then immediately covering in order to get GME short sale restricted through the next day to set up a gamma squeeze.  The short seller HFs still had some tricks to get around this, but it apparently did hamper them enough for the jump from 40 to where we are now.",1,0,1614871446,SkyKirasagi
