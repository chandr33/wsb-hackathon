28,gqnna2k,"I‚Äôm kind of cringey on this because I‚Äôve had to do data analysis for many engineers and they are often more of an obstacle than anything else. Extremely intelligent, very A+B=C and thus, horrendous at statistical analysis. If you asked 90% of them to run a financial/economic simulation, you would get better results from a college freshman. There‚Äôs a reason they suggest MBAs for engineers-helps with real world thinking. Again, some of the most intelligent people I‚Äôve ever met, but as mentioned by someone else above, they struggle when psychology comes into play/ when things aren‚Äôt textbook cases. My dad is an engineer, and do you know the only two college courses he got C‚Äôs in?  Accounting and Statistics. His hardest classes, according to him.
