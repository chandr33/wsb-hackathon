Edit: they've barely dropped during this sell off. That should say something",3,0,1614882722,Tookie_Knows

7,gppbokj,"Shorting LYV is a terrible idea.  They are sitting on $1B in cash with a $1.5B line of credit.  Their debt covenants are pretty favorable with little restrictions.  

I don't particularly like the company, but they are surviving the nuclear apocalypse of live events and are positioned to come out stronger than they were before.  

I saw a lot of bearish sentiment but it's simply not supported in the numbers.  I wrote a detailed bullish argument for LYV here: https://goformike.com/the-bull-case-for-live-nation/

Also this ""A lot of people are cutting deals directly with venues and selling tickets on their website cutting out middle men"" shows a terrible understanding of their business model.  What does it even mean?",2,1,1614894631,mikethewalrus
