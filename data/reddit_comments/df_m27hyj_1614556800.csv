8,gqhpg4y,"So when the price was at ATH 513.12, and you wanted to calculate the next-low target.

At that time, 513.12 was the Previous High, 2.57 was the Previous Low.

513.12\*2.57=1318.7184.

The square root of 1318.7184 is 36.31.

And the price crashed all the way to 38.5.",1,0,1615409238,geniusevj
