4,gqiugup,"Let me ask you something, who is going to buy GME at 100k when SI is 30 percent? Under SEC rules naked shorts or brokers or MM would have had to buy it at any price. Since you are seemingly running against option spreads, rather than naked shorts, no one will be forced to buy anything. Someone would have to buy an overvalued GME share at 100k with no upside of their own volition.",-11,0,1615429404,JimCricket99

42,gqj76vg,"There's no we or our. We are a collective of individuals. To exist otherwise would be illegal. The following is not financial advice:

No, there's no way to buy a stock higher than the lowest available sell price.

Theoretically, if every sell price (bid price) was at 100k, then the only way to buy is at 100k. Once purchased at 100k, the buy price and sell price are theoretically 100k. If nobody ever sells less than 100k, and you can't buy less than 100k, it's worth 100k.

Unfortunately, not every broker allows listing the stock at 100k when the current price is so much lower.

This is why I will put in my sell order at 100k, and work my way down incrimentally until the sell order no longer gets rejected by my broker.",2,0,1615436691,atrivell

Since they understand WSB people buy and hold, they have figured out a way to make money off of call option premiums, and mitigating their losses.
