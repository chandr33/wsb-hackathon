9,gplnepx,I said from the beginning.  The sub should have gone private the second they published that fuckin’ article about it.  1 million to 9 million.  That’s the size of a large city.  zjz is literally the gatekeeper of sanity.,14,1,1614819961,Surprise-Chimichanga

17,gplpcvq,"See, the trick is his Killbots don’t have flaws, like [preset kill limits](https://youtu.be/EF3g4Ua5e7k).   Automod can strike them down faster than they pop up.  I just wish the noobs and whiny fuckers would give the mod team a break and tuck their tinfoil away.",7,1,1614821041,Surprise-Chimichanga

19,gplqey2,"Yes.  But at least when there were **only** 1 million whiny brats running around we had some semblance of order.  Now you have morons posting tickers under gain, as if they had any money at stake.  I wanna hit the children, can we please start hitting the children?",5,0,1614821578,Surprise-Chimichanga
20,gplttxb,"But but but

My $15,000 “YOLO” on a long is just as meaningful as DFV’s millions. #15KLivesMatter or something /s 

Seriously though wsb is about actual yolos, massive loss porn, and wins that make people dizzy while day dreaming. Nobody in this sub gives a fuck that it took a month for me to be up 20%. r/investing, r/stocks, r/several others do so maybe people should get their validation their? Just a thought",3,0,1614823328,LDSpaghettiMonster
21,gpm1ta2,"WSB is “Guh!”, it’s the Cult of PRPL, it’s dudes blowing $30,000 on SPY puts with 0DTE.  It’s not some dumbass buying shares of AAPL and sitting on them for two years.

This is a fucking Casino.  WSBers don’t need validation.  They just want to rub it in other people’s faces.

This newer wave of hand holders is beyond frustrating.  Instead of people telling you they’re hot shit, and you’re lucky they’re sharing their stock tips with you we have people chasing the dragon and whining when they go bust buying high and selling low.",3,0,1614827289,Surprise-Chimichanga
22,gpmc89j,"so many bots talking to each other (I use bot as a catch-all for all the automatons spreading misinfo)
