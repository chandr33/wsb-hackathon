15,gqffmby,"It kind of is a race. I‚Äôm going to have to pay for my own health insurance (or out of pocket, even worse) right after the end of this year.

Besides that more time sensitive emergency (SSRI withdrawal is one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever heard of in my life, I‚Äôve already dealt with varying degrees of side effects, and I think being on this shit for so many years may have wrecked my brain and body) I just want to start my fucking life.

I need to break free of dependence on my family, but not just that, live MORE than the life I never got to live, before my 20s are over.

Why would I need 40K upfront to make 50-100K by the end of the year? A year ago (when I knew LITERALLY NOTHING about any of this) GME was $4 a share. $4,000 would have bought 1,000 shares. Those 1,000 shares would have been worth $483,000 at the high this year, and still $260,000+ right now.

That would have been from just $4,000, and only a year later (which could have also meant less taxes out of the huge 6 figure gain).",1,0,1615367368,wokeinthematrix

If you truly like gme and want it to have long term success and be able to be a customer into the future you want them to raise capital cheaply to fund growth and their new e commerce strategy

Issuing shares is the cheapest possible way to raise capital especially when your shares are waaaaay overpriced.
