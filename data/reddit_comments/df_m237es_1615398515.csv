1,gqgyze6,"So here's what I don't get: yes, the flash crash will suss out all the paper hands, but if anything, the majority is all diamond handers now from the FIRST huge crash from $400. We're not selling. So other than encouraging the diamond handers (who again, are the majority) to buy at these amazing discount prices, what on earth do the hedgies think they're accomplishing here?  


Like, we didn't sell before, so we're not going to sell now, and at the end of the day regardless of flash crash, the hedgies are going to be in the same position they were at the beginning of the day - they've got to write a cheque that their shorts can't cash. So what's the point?",10,0,1615398516,SaucyJ4ck
