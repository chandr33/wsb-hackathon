2,gqi4bqt,Did you just cross the $2000 threshold? This can allow for x2-x4 margin depending on broker. Just don't use the margin. If buying power isn't the figure you want to look at there is usually another number for cash balance or similar.,5,0,1615415873,icanadd

We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615417893,VisualMod
