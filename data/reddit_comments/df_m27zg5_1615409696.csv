29,gqhql28,"**Just sent a letter to my congressman about the manipulation today. Please do the same! Feel free to use my template!**

Dear Congressman,

Today the GameStop stock took a rapid plummet of 40% of its share value after a steady climb for the past week.

However, a journalist named Wallace Witkowski with Market Watch published an article speaking of it's rapid descent on March 10, 2021 at 11:55am EST. The stock did not fall until 12:18pm EST.

This is clear evidence that mainstream media is siding with the Hedge Funds to try and spread fear while getting people to sell, thus further dropping the stock price so that shorts can be cleared at lower trading prices.

I implore you to please look into this. Pressure the SEC, DTCC and your peers to get to the bottom of this price manipulation. This is not fair, free-market trading, and these coordinated attacks cannot go without consequence.

Here is a tweet from DavidNIO, who documented the publication when it happened. As expected, the article has since been re-released at a later time that fits the time-line after the stock's price fall.

https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061?s=19

Thank you for your deep concern in this matter. I know you are on the side of fair trading, and look forward to hearing your thoughts in future hearings.

Sincerely,

**Edit:**

**For those who are doubting, here is a copy of the article prior to it being edited / resubmitted at 12:43pm**
