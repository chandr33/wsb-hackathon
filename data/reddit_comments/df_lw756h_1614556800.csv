4,gpfnuqc,"They  absolutely can.  Another DD  covered this before.  

Shorts can make it appear that they have covered with ootions.  For the shorts to make it appear that they have v covered a short position  they need to WRITE (sell) call options.

A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.

The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.

Basically the reason they sold the 800 calls is because they are the least likely to go ITM.

If the price actually hit 800, they would be double ruined. They would be forced to cover the shares bought up to cover the calls, AND still be left with their short positions.",2,0,1614705623,hyhwang90
