10,gqds5yg,I don‚Äôt think AMC even has a short squeeze situation. GME did because they were short 140%. I don‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind AMC apart from the fact that it was held short by hedge funds and that they were hoping it would be crushed into the ground. But it looks fine now. The party is sort of over for AMC. Unless you can explain otherwise?,1,0,1615329389,DawudM
