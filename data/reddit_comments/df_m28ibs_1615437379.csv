63,gqjkyak,"It's actually good. If you have low volume it is easier to move the price. The price can only stay low after an attack as long as there are sell orders around that price. As you can see from yesterday the paperhands got wiped pretty quickly and we rose back afterwards with low volume and nice discounts.

It also means that in the event of the squeeze the price will go up much more violently. The low volume on GME is what makes all this possible in the first place. You can't pull this off with something like silver (as they tried to disctract us in january)",1,0,1615445001,ensoniq2k

I'm not an expert and don't know what that point is and you should decide for yourself, but any out of tge money calls that i have within a week of expiration i sell and buy what i can afford with around a 3 to 4 week expiration. I sometimes cheat and deviate if i get greedy but that's usually my ideal approach for this situation.

Not advice. I hold positions. My risk may be different than yours blah blah blah. Otm calls this late are too much of a gamble to yolo the amount I've gained to this point.",1,0,1615446578,good2goo
