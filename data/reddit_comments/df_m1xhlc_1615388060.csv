19,gqg8le2,"Unbounded growth without support is going to be fun for technical analysis when it falls. It took two days in January for the stock to go from 40 to 400, and this transition from 200 on up is scarcely slower. Yesterday started with a mass sell off of small transactions, likely retail ""diamond hands"" that only stopped when a single large buyer picked up 200k shares for roughly $43M 15 minutes after open. A similar large buyer spent approximately $3M to jump the stock to 240 the first time.  


This is a house of cards, and at some point the large buyers are going to withdraw, and there will be a lot more bagholders this time than there were in January.",-45,0,1615388066,BackgroundSearch30
