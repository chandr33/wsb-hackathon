So I contacted my gp and went in for a check up. Turns out my diamond hands have been rubbing off on my dick. I asked both my doctor and my broker what this means and basically I'm 3-7 trading sessions away from becomming a diamond dick.                

Obviously this isn't all bad but I feel like people should be aware of this risk.
