9,gqg6dh8,"To everyone here. 

Do your best. Hold them big old 💎🙌🏻. Hedgies don’t care about anyone’s: Background, ethnic group, religious beliefs or anything else that more often than not causes people to not get along. 

For GME, In the past, the present and until this MF blasts through the moon the only thing you and they care about is Red and Green. 

People holding hundreds of shares are doing as an important a job as people holding fractions of shares. It’s all fuel in the tank.

11,gqg6det,"20% gain or loss in a 5 minute period is required for a halt and we just haven't had that, most of the big movements have occurred in premarket which has no halts. Also, we're gonna see gradually fewer halts as we move to higher price points because 20% now is nearly a $60 movement while before it would've been like a $12 movement.",1,0,1615387025,AVeryHappyTeddy
