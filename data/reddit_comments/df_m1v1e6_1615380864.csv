33,gqfvbmg,"I've been too deep into GME to read DD on other stocks so neither GE nor UNFI are something I'll invest in. But DOMO Capital has been advocating GME for _months_ before it exploded. They even had 1 on 1 talk with RC. They even tried to talk with Cramer lately pretty much blatantly stating ""Hey buddy, if GME won't talk to you, talk with us because we don't assume to know their plans, RC told us his plans"".

And their YoY returns have been amazing since their inception.

Since they exited GME they have nonstop been advocating for UNFI and honestly, I'm pretty sure they know what they are talking about after seeing how they handled GME.

So I think UNFI might be a very solid investment!
