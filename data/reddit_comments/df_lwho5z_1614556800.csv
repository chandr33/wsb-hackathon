2,gphf3ef,"Super simplified version. 

You think a price is going to drop. So you borrow my shares. (for a small fee). Then you sell those at current price. Later when I want my shares back, you buy shares at the presumably lower current value.... And give them back to me. Therefore you sold some at a higher value, but repurchased to pay me back at a lower value.",1,0,1614734463,Nerdso77
3,gphf7fb,"You “sell” shares that you don’t own at the market price therefore collecting the proceeds.

You have to buy them back at some point in the future.

You hope the price goes down.

Example:

Xyz is currently trading for 100 per share.  You short sell 10 shares and collect 1000$

It then goes down to 90 per share.  You buy back the shares at a cost of 900

You made 100",1,0,1614734520,baii7
4,gphf84a,"You sell a stock, you don't even have and gamble that its price will drop in a certain time, then you have to buy it back, no matter what price it will be.
So let's say you sell 100 shares for 10$ and after a period of time it hits 6$ and you buy it back.
That makes 4$*100 = 400$ profit.
That's how I understand it, I am kinda new and my English sucks. 
So sorry for that. 
If it's not correct, someone pls tell me I am gonna delet it.",1,0,1614734530,CrueL_Sun79
5,gphfjtz,But understand the risks!  You have a potential for an unlimited loss because a stock could rise to a very high level.  Look at GME.  It was a very low priced stock and rose to crazy levels...hedge funds lost a s ton,1,0,1614734697,baii7
