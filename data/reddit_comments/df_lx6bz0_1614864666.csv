0,gpngeyt,cant tell is its wsb algos or not though.  News is pushing that skt is the next wsb stock which makes me skeptical. Maybe they pushed it onto wsb to begin with,5,0,1614865236,dmc1l

5,gpni6ll,"Oh gotcha. There was a thread yesterday with a few hundred upvotes calling out SKT. I think it's a legit play. Decent fundamentals, recently reintroduced dividends, hot real estate market, it probably bottomed out recently... and super high SI which we know is a target around here.

If there are sentiment algos buying based on that they probably made a good trade.",3,0,1614866172,singluon

9,gpnlaft,"The drop at 9:15 corresponded to a new 50k short that happened.  There wasn't a drop for the 150k short that happened at 9am, which means it's likely going to tank at open, at least for a little while.  Same thing happened to RKT yesterday.  If it's similar it will stay down most of the day.",2,0,1614867799,realaccountforsure

47,gppi6m3,Way too many Yahoo articles about this to be legit. Be rational. Tanger Outlets? It's an aborted fetus of a company with no real route to adaptation. It's an outlet store for christs sake. That's the lowest ring of the retail ladder. Best case scenario is they get bought out by Amazon and don't hold your breath. You're better off burning your money.,-3,0,1614897607,WhiskeyInSpace
