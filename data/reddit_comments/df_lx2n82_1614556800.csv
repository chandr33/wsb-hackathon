If you were cool with **buying GME at $100+** ***in January***, then **YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM** ***BUYING GME at $100+ NOW***

***Line of order (losers):*** Melvin &lt; Citadel &lt; DTCC &lt; Gov't &lt; Global Economic Collapse

This is ***TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS***

THINK PPL

IF WE'RE SAYING TO **THE MOON** ETC (As for me, I'm thinking more ***intergalactic travel***)

THIS STUFF IS LIKE ***TRILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY***

LETS BE ON OUR:

STAR TREK

STAR WARS

ETC

BUY HODOR

**FOR THE SQUEEZE:**

***Limit Sell Order: $999,999.99***

As of now we‚Äôre all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you‚Äôre unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you‚Äôre concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!

$999,999.99

Let‚Äôs ALL get THE BEST PRICE!

My addition:Gamestop needs to get into the anime/manga industry. It only keeps going up,so selling anime and manga could benefit them,as well as related merchandise (action figures,pc parts with anime themes,themed clothes etc).

Maybe they can start their own streaming service,e-tournaments and other shit down the line. In a few years,if all goes well,they might even reach 1k per share. If Amazon can,so can Gamestop (the video game industry is worth billions of dollars and it only increases.If they include the manga/anime one,even more).

Also,an online store akin to Steam,which of course will include their other products as well. Key feature: doesn't require a launcher. You buy the game and that's it. Digital downloads are good.

My ramblings could be absolutely stupid,but correct me if you want,I don't shy away from learning more about shit that interests me.

25,gpl0k8k,"The next big GME move to look out for is probably going to be the current CEO George Sherman ""resigning""

Before becoming the CEO of GameStop, Sherman was the CEO of Victra, a Verizon retailer that runs brick and mortar Verizon stores.  

His tenure at Victra was extremely short, leading me to believe he wasn't the easiest person to work with and found a home in the pre-Cohen GameStop swamp.  Not to mention that a CEO that specializes in B&amp;M locations is the polar opposite of the future vision for GME.

The news that Sherman has ""resigned"" is going to be an insane catalyst, things are only looking good from here on out",60,0,1614808333,talascio
