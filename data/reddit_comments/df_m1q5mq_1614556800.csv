10,gqf28vh,"and here I bought at $300, sold at $90. Loss of $60,000. I'm actually getting sick watching this price go up. Lost 60k in two days. And hardly a month later it's back to $300. I have never been this close before.",1,0,1615355382,redditprofile1234

13,gqf31in,Well take this as a learning experience. Stock market is very unpredictable. This is why you hold. You donâ€™t lose money till you sell. I been holding at 257. Now Iâ€™ll prob hit the green.,1,0,1615355996,App2918q

16,gqf3mh5,Just think about the panic you would have had when the price hit 30$. And it stayed that low for weeks. It is okay that you sold - NOBODY knows how stonks develop in the future.,1,0,1615356456,VollbierJo

22,gqf56rw,"Yes but that was not easy to trust in when you are 90% down. The fear holding through losses that high can be crushing.
Not everyone is made for this and thus it was a good decision to sell at a 60k loss instead of selling 1 week later at a 90k loss.",1,0,1615357733,VollbierJo

32,gqfce6i,Yea not everyone is made for it. Because there were no events or news to counter or discredit any of the points in favor of gme turnaround. Selling was emotion. There was no reason to sell if you were investing in the company. A squeeze was hardly the main reason to get in on gme. It just became the cherry. Even now the person could jump back in and at least make their money back. What do i know. Not financial advice,1,0,1615364221,Shwiftygains

60k is not too bad but just enough to convince you to not partake in shit like this again (high risk), get you to switch up your strategy (after consulting w more experienced traders, or to lay off trading for a while (mental health &gt;)",1,0,1615368021,shala0
