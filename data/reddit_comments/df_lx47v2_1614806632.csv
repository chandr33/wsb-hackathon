But the whole point of the DD was to point out that the big guys want the shares by March 9th because of the special dividend. If we can get RKT up tomorrow and Friday and execute our in the money calls it will be tendies for everybody. Don’t be so damn fickle. I like the stock,16,0,1614806704,IcE802
