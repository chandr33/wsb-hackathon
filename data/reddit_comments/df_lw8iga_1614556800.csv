6,gpfuyds,Dumped 2k in RKT. This thing is about to blow. They are giving a $1.11 dividend on the 9th. Fundamentals are strong. RKT is worth at least $45 even without the hype. With the short squeeze it's primed for lift off. ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€,4,0,1614708717,swhichcoin

10,gpfv48v,"I bought 2@29. Read the DD and was sold. I'm not rich. Just doing small swing trades to trade up to 1g. I've made 23% returns in a month so, so far so good. Rkt is up 12%+/- just today and should push higher given how thorough the DD was (the DD comments in there were also solid). Just holding for that dividend and then selling. 

If GME offers a split I'll go back in on that too.

For full disclosure I'm only here for the profits no joke, and I only owned two shares, so me diamond handing didn't mean shit either way

Edit: I'm a janitor. Any scalp or swing I can make I need to take. I live in CA and have a side hustle as well. I am not by any means even rich enough to buy more than a few shares of anything at a time, although the memes have been great and I appreciate this sub for interesting me in trading, I literally can't afford to not take the profits.  can't",1,0,1614708788,BeeBoopBot
