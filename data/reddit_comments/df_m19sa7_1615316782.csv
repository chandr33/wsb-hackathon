Sorry to poke holes, but if this is accurate, holy shit bro.

If short seller A sells short a share and short seller B buys that share to cover and close a short position, wouldn't that transaction be included in the short volume, but not add anything to the open short interest?

If that's the case then even a daily short volume ratio approaching 100% doesn't *necessarily* mean an increase in short positions. (It probably still does, just not in an easily measurable or verifiable amount.)

&gt;England kept marching in lines against american rebels that adopted the native american battle tactics.

An oversimplification on a few fronts.

* Colonial forces continued to engage in stand-up fights. The hit-and-fade fighting was just one part of the conflict and a valuable one that kept a lot of deployed British forces occupied. But it did not fix and force surrender either.
* British forces had fought irregular forces many times. Recall that Washington himself fought in the French and Indian War just a decade prior. They knew to fix and destroy the logistical and basing locations of opponents which engage in hit-and-run tactics as well as seize routes of supply and strong points. To supply guns and men, one needs depots and logistics.
* The British were professionals and the Colonial forces had plenty of weak points, logistically speaking, they could strike at. The issue is that the British were not facing a purely unpracticed opponent. They were facing an army lead and trained by experienced professionals. More over, the Colonial forces were not the only combatant in the room. The British could ill-afford to go all in while the French sat just across the channel and a whole, globe-spanning empire required defending.
* The war did not just wage on land. The better example of such tactics put to good use is seen with the privateers at sea, where neutral ports can be relied upon for supply (or any of the thousands of backwater estuaries) and the British forces relied on a very exposed supply chain that crossed thousands of miles of ocean. There is a reason the island nation focused on its naval power for centuries.",3,0,1615317682,JustAnotherQubesUser

48,gqd2dxc,"I already replied to this in your post in the other sub but for visibility sake:

While I'd love to agree with this as it would confirm my bias that gme is going to Pluto, using short volume is not a good indicator for calculating SI. The main reason being is that MM are constantly adding liquidity so that trading does not pause buy selling shares they don't own and then milliseconds later buying them to keep liquidity flowing.

What does this mean? It means that they facilitate transactions by selling shares that they don't necessarily have that second so that trading doesn't go kaput. But Essentially they are buying the stock the next second later. It looks like a short buts actually a slight bid ask spread for MM to make sure there's liquidity in the market. 

That being said I would take your methodology and apply it it several other tickers to see if GME is an outlier. If you can show other tickers have vastly different short volumes then perhaps your methodology is correct. 

Otherwise what you are calculating is basically MMs adding liquidity by borrowing shares to sell to bidders and then buying them from askers within a fraction of a second. Technically this is not shorting but it does show up as short volume. 

Always compare to other tickers as general rule of thumb to make sure that what you are seeing is actually an outlier and not a normal mechanism of the markets.",3,0,1615317789,Cstooby
