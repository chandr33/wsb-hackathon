14,gqhs8mv,"Possibly, the Deutsche Telekom basically has a sort-of monopoly as an ISP in Germany. 

For example, even if you've got a different provider such as Vodafone, when issues arise it'll be Telekom technicians that handle it due to Telekom owning most if not all of the infrastructure if I'm not mistaken",1,0,1615410432,DanPhyronix

23,gqi8m19,"Yea I suppose thats true. But those are quite expensive and I am but a poor student. 
A leap costs almost five times as much for the same strike.

Another stupid thing is I have to sell a winning position atm. I also have options in ING and they have been gaining me an average of 100 euro a day.

But yea I do see ING go to a max of 13 and DTE should hit 25 easily. 

So im gonna do half and half
As in fuck ING and half leaps half 21 may.",1,0,1615417975,NosPhoenix

28,gqj3211,"Anecdotally I lived there for a couple years and signed up with their rival for phone service and regretted it from my experience versus my friends' who had Telekom. Their service signal was noticeably better.   


Their internet on the flip side was a pain in the ass to set up, so pick your poison with them.",1,0,1615434087,ljstens22

32,gqrjusp,"I think what DT does in Germany vs what tmus business model in the US is a bit different. Through my career I’ve had mtgs with DT Innovation division in Silicon Valley, US, but it never dealt with TMUS. Sure there could be some impact on tmus business, but not sure how DT business correlates with TMUS.",1,0,1615606276,Retard_2028

35,gqzwssu,"&gt;This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years.
 
This is honestly one of the biggest reasons why germans don't do much with stocks. There is quite literally a trauma as you said. When asked why German don't do stocks much, most people refer to the Deutsche Telekom",1,0,1615801856,KittenOnHunt
