The last time GME hit 450 it did it in like 2 days. When it happens, it happens fast, it will happen right before your very own eyes. Be patient and hold, this will hit 1000$ +.

67,gqf189r,"I’m just a new ape holding 2 GME, broke af, convince my wife and her boyfriend to let me throw some change at GME when it was $50. But from what the text-to-speech said, that last spike was in response to halting calls, most of the shorts haven’t covered, and still more calls have been placed. So they staged off the game squeeze, but the majority of the short squeeze still hasn’t happened. On paper, nobody knows for sure how far this thing can go, but I think that the bottom of that guesstimated peak starts at where the last spike ended...$483. And if that’s the bottom, those hope of $1000/share don’t seem that ludicrous. The bigger estimates of $4000 and $5000 might be possible. I know Jack and shit, and Jack paper handed at $55 and left town...it could go to $420,420.69 for all I know. When it starts to get high, and people and institutional holders start seeing dollar signs, that’s when shit gets squirrely. 

All I know is I have 1 share to hold, and 1 share to ride the roller coaster and buy the dip (if there ever really is another meaningful one before the moon) to hold some more til we shoot past the moon to Mars and beyond.
