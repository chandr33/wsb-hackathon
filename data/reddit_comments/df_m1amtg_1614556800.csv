14,gqcxchb,Lots of Chinese companies are empty boxes. Half of them just rent an empty office room in some village and tell u they have a massive manufacturing facility. Not worth the risk imo.

25,gqdk422,Not tryna be racist. Mostly sarcastic based off the sheer number of Chinese companies that go bust after their numbers get exposed. Sorry if u were bag holding lucklin and u weren‚Äôt one of the chosen ones who got to see their stores,0,0,1615325655,ErectoPeentrounus

30,gqdmvg0,My sentiment is more or less is that I don‚Äôt trust Chinese companies on their numbers and I see nothing racist in that.
