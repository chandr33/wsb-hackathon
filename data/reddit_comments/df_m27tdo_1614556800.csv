44,gqhzwwx,"Geesh, not everything is a conspiracy. 

$348 was a price ceiling. Lots of traders had sell orders in that range. 

The higher the price rises, the lower the % likelihood that it will continue to rise, because Ape brains require reference points to make predictions.

$348 was a historical resistance level, so lots of traders set sell orders slightly below to lock profits. 

For people that bought at $50, selling at $345 is a 700% return. 

But to continue holding to $400 substantially increases the risk (of not hitting 400, and then missing a sell opportunity in the 300s), because historically, time spent above $300-level was very short lived.

So this resistance point executed a lot of selling activity from traders that wanted to reduce risk.

Possible we'll still hit $400, but it could take several weeks to get back there.

Lots of longs exited, so that ground will need to be covered by new players to keep the momentum increasing.",-2,0,1615413804,SuicideIsSoSexyRrrrr

47,gqi4r2u,"When fundamentals don't matter, the next indicator is group sentiment. 

Group sentiment is determined by historical prices, momentum, and floors. 

The problem with group sentiment, is each person in the group has a different risk-tolerance. So as price climbs closer to the previous ATH, you'll get more members dropping-off, reducing momentum.

So calculating a top requires determining which range the group would start feeling SELL sentiment, and then calculating where that sentiment turns into SELL FOMO.

I had sell orders set weeks in advanced at $339. I missed the day's top by $9.

My guess: tomorrow is a bloodbath. Group sentiment does not like large drops. Spreads fear, increases SELL FOMO. Could see floor drop for 3 days.

Started at exactly 12:17 and ended at 12:41

Isn't the government PPT supposed to usually do their work during the lunch hour? Did they somehow fuck their job up? Or was their job in this instance to tank the momentum so that a squeeze couldn't happen?

Because humans are pattern driven creatures and begin to panic in the unknown. 

If a price out-of-pattern happens, like a new ATH, it exists briefly before dropping again. We need to see that new price tease several times before the group is comfortable enough to trust it as a floor.

We probably won't see a direct run up to $1000. It will be multiple new ATH discoveries with lots of regressions.

I've been watching the same thing with cryp coin price for years now. Without fundamentals, the price is driven by group psychology.

Personally, I don't trust groups. There's always a point where predators will leave the group as bag holders.",1,0,1615456832,SuicideIsSoSexyRrrrr
