17,gq9gq0l,"You can blame them, and you'd be correct, they should have.   


But you can't ignore the fact that we have a culture and government (see unlimitted borrowing capacity for any field of study) that has pushed people into this situation with the promise of a better future.   


I put myself through college with nearly zero debt, and managed to graduate without it. I chose a field of study that led to a job, in an industry I'm still in today.   


But the act of pressuring people as a culture, and sponsoring people as a government.. That isn't nothing.   


Your argument could be applied to the 2008 financial crisis: People shouldn't have borrowed on sub-prime mortgages they couldn't repay, they crashed the economy..   


Or lenders should not have made sub-prime mortgages... Both should carry responsibility, but it only ever seems to be one side that suffers from it...
