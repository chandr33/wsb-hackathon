Yeah, obviously AMC and GME were the two big stocks (along with the fringe ones that we don't mention here) when everyone was learning what a short squeeze was, so I can get why they were cranking then. I'm wondering now, though, why people are acting like AMC is a LT play? Unless I'm missing something, it seems like the only similarity was that they were heavily shorted.
