84,gpni82s,"I spent 2 years sleeping under a bridge because of heroin addiction. The years prior to that I spent living in a trailer with no plumbing. At this point nothing really phases me. I've been sober for almost 3 years and as long as I stay sober, things will literally never get worse than they once were. There's nothing that can happen to me that'll be harder than that. I've had to detox from heroin while laying on a concrete slab in 30 degree weather, having shit like that happen several times changes you. So, even if I end up totally broke... Who gives a fuck? I could end up with dick cancer and it'd still be preferable to relapsing on dope because at least with dick cancer I keep my dignity. 

That's something that seperates us from a lot of the hedgies. I've been baptized in poverty and grief. If I suddenly lost my life savings and got kicked out of my home, I would not give a single fuck. As long as I stay sober, I'm fine and shit won't phase me. I've had to dig food out of garbage cans before, I've had all my belongings stolen from me while I slept outside, there's really nothing that scares me anymore aside from relapsing. But when it comes to the issue of relapse I feel like I have üíéüíé‚úã because that's just not an option.",101,2,1614866193,Scipio_Americanus_
