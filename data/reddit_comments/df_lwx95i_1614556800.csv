13,gpjq3yl,"Starting This is a good time to buy the dip in my opinion. Yesterday there was a little dip and we started  new thread which pushed to 43. I think it will hit 40 today. this is not a stock we are only doing a short squeeze with. This is a stock that has factual backing such as:

1. They are going to pay you to hold. There is a dividend coming soon where you will be paid. I am holding till then and buying more. I will make $11000 at $1 a share which is huge on Friday. I bought 11, 000 shares. 
2. This is a stock that is making a huge profit. None of the other short squeezes had quarterly reports showing large profits. It increased over 8 million in last report.
3. There is a great forecast as the housing industry is going up big time.
4. Great leadership

This is the best and least risky short squeeze you will have.

31,gpk8phd,"Melt down of RKT we have seen today from $47 in pre market to $28s noon isnt for oversold position by retail investors.  High open Short sell interest is still intact. My broker portal Interactive Brokers shows â€œno stocks available for lending, and Stock borrowing interest rate od 58% APR, which is more than 54% oc yesterday.

Then why the melt down?

Margin call triggered options closure resulting in Gamma Ease (opposite of Gamma Squeeze) that resulted in less shares required to be maintained for remaining option OI.

Example, one option contract closed = Gamma ratio releases 100 shares

Since short lending interest is still 58% and no stocks avlbl to borrow, short sell narrative is still intact.  Hold on.

Some 40k contracts OI with strike price of 35 and 40 this Friday.  

Then 80k contracts (requiring 8 million shares) OI with strike price of $50 expiry 3/19 is a promising story.
