3,gpgh10w,Sell and take your gains.  I wanted to earlier but I've traded to much and can't trade.  Holding (not intentionally) for a moon landing,1,0,1614718150,Dadpool33
4,gpgh2ak,"You can google an options calculator, or just estimate.  You can estimate using the option's delta, looks like this one has a delta of around 0.8.  So if stock goes up 10, your option will go up roughly 8.",1,0,1614718164,joja0206
5,gpgh62b,"Well I originally had 3, I sold one for 1k so Iâ€™m currently up 70 bucks from my deposit yesterday. Iâ€™m either gonna sell 1 and hold 1, or hold both.",1,0,1614718209,m4vis
6,gpgh6fd,Use the Greeks delta is how much the option is expected to increase per dollar rise in price,1,0,1614718213,ecrane2018
7,gpgh7vn,You can go to https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/ it's not exact but it gives you an idea.,1,0,1614718230,johnnyg085
8,gpgh7ti,I am holding like a fool,1,0,1614718230,SpyderKoz
9,gpghcj6,Dude if you are asking this question you should absolutely not be trading.... That being said yolo,1,0,1614718284,petesafaggit

11,gpghepb,"I mean, I was told this was a casino",1,0,1614718308,m4vis
12,gpghghi,And you have to subtract theta also,1,0,1614718328,nvanderw
13,gpghlu7,Yes. Casino. Correct.,2,0,1614718389,INKWENSU_Wocha
14,gpghq2r,Carry on I suppose ðŸ˜¬,1,0,1614718438,petesafaggit
15,gpghvqj,I already sold one so Iâ€™m slightly in the green even if my current options expire,1,0,1614718504,m4vis
16,gpgin6r,This is just an estimate...and 8 is correct,1,0,1614718821,joja0206
17,gpgjhem,"8 is not correct.   A call is a right to buy 100 shares at specific price. So delta of .8 corresponds to a .8\*100 increase in the call option. This is why options at the money usually have a delta close to .5.

It is one thing to be a retard and forgivable, but entirely another thing to spread wrong information. Seriously. It is a 2 minute read on investopedia regarding delta.",1,0,1614719180,nvanderw
18,gpgjzil,"The option price goes up by 8 dollars. Profiting you 800 more dollars on the trade.   go look up an options calculator, come back and apologize when you're done",1,0,1614719396,joja0206
19,gpkpyvk," I don't have to look up an options calculator when I can use greeks to calculate options myself and I have bought and sold tens of thousands of them in the last year.  

Btw now you are contradicting your original comment. By original comments logic, you would profit $80  (8 \*10).",0,0,1614803737,nvanderw
20,gpkq2cc,The fact you even need to use option calculator makes me question your ability to do mental math at all.,0,0,1614803779,nvanderw
