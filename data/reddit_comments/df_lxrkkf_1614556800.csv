5,gpom1pz,"RKT has no squeeze stop thinking it does!  Itâ€™s a long term vest.  The volume isnâ€™t there nor is the ratio.  Itâ€™s too low.  Donâ€™t be fooled.  This is a long term not another GME.  RKT, BB, NOK, Silver, BBBY, AMC are all distractions to try and get you to sell GME for another cheap buy in and squeeze.  Well it wonâ€™t happen.  Those arenâ€™t being shorted enough.  Buy them and hold on the fundamentals only.

BB is supplying software for smart EVs.

NOK is leading 5G in space and on earth.

BBBY well, they might be sinking slowly.

Silver is silver itâ€™s precious.  Supply and demand only.

AMC may rebound when theaters open but look at the history, the highest was like 36$ in 2015!  Good luck but Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s a buy low and let it grow and sell when it levels off.  Unless AMC changes itâ€™s fundamentals itâ€™s going to stay a small traded stock.

GME is getting all this short selling attention so yes it was a hype but now with a new COO and incoming CFO and a change in business direction there are fundamentals to believe in.  GME is a short gain right now, but once the hype is over and the dust settles buying low and letting it sale might be a good option if you believe in the fundamentals.

RKT is insurance and mortgages mostly.  They have been traded around 20 for YEARS!  This has become a distraction and a pump and dump stock.  What are the fundamentals?  Did they do something different?  No!  Itâ€™s a distraction from GME only.  Just like the rest have been over the last few weeks.  Buy it if you want but itâ€™s a long term investment only.  Itâ€™s not another GME.

None of this is financial advice, I just did a little bit of googling for fundamentals and looked at yahoo finance for there 5y streaks.  Do your own research.  Yahoo finance, finra.Morningstar. something.  Do your own research.",-17,0,1614883849,Chewdog316

20,gpoxnd1,"I honestly believe that if that big spike right to under 30 hadn't happened at open, it would have ran higher.  Despite being called RKT, it falls hard after launching it seems.  There were huge walls holding it down below thirty, and the volume has dried up since lunch.  I'm hoping for some upward movement AH, but the momentum got killed real early today unfortunately.  This is one that I can easily justify switching to a long position if it doesn't run up again before EoD tomorrow.  Looks like it's going to be held at &lt;27 due to a 20k+ wall I just noticed, so we'll see.",3,0,1614888646,bigsoftee84
