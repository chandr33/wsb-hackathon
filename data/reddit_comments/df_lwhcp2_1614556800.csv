17,gphfpso,"That's only a small part of the overall potential here. One big thing is the dividends. As the 10yr rises, a lot of institutional investors move out of traditional ""growth"" stocks...think Apple. Why? Because Apple has mountains of cash and inflation is bad for cash. Dividend stocks are used as a defensive move to generate income, and also have potnential for a stock price increase.   


$TGT is an excellent play in this space because it fits several criteria:  
1. reopening  
2. Dividends  
3. strong E-commerce growth",5,0,1614734781,WallStreetWarrants

i'd want to see more about how reopening helps them though. Like semes like it would hurt them... thought they are brick and mortar, so could get a few sales off of amzn poeple who are going out more... but wouldn't those people just keep buying essentials on amzn, groceries from regular grocery stores, and then spend extra money on going out stuff???

also ecommerce seems like prolly not a bad idea but are they really gonna move in on amzn space??? seems more defensive to prevent drop then anything else",1,0,1614735747,linc007

Retail shares seems to be falling. That's ok but I don't see it shrinking much the next quarter. May just be rotation I'm general. I'm long Walmart, Target, and Costco.
