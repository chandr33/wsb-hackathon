49,gpm8gnw,"Type slower please, I'm dyslexic.

I googled 'SPAC' but what does that have to do with this? Does that mean it won't do jack? Would I be better burning $1,100 in singles for heat?

This thing says that an SPAC has no commercial applications, so it's basically just a thing people dump money into?

Would that be why it's been trading at $10 since forever?  


EDIT: Yeah, so I see this article says they trade at 10.00... so basically... okay what the fuck does any of this have to do with Friday? Uhg... I get the feeling buying calls would be meaningless now... am I wrong? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!!!!

The portion of the chart where it just stagnates at 10 dollars is the period where the company was listed as a SPAC. All the recent volatility was when they announced their acquisition target and after the ticker changed to UWMC.
