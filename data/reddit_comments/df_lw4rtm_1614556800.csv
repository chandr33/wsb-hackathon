1,gpfae7g,"Kinda... bought 25 shares at 269, went up like 7k or so , then Robinhood pulled their bullshit and it crashed. Held as long as I could but sold at 40 lol... shoots back up days later, but back in at 7 shares at 137... 

So not a huge commitment but still ya know",2,0,1614699676,ObJuan13
2,gpfaeqq,"I FOMO bought a single share at $246 early on in the initial spike. I calmed my ass down, did research for about 3-4 weeks, and got another share at $48. Honestly if I never recoup on that first share, I feel like putting some skin in the game got me a very valuable ""trial by fire"" style education that will help me a lot in my future investing. So I'm not counting it as a real loss. Plus this was play money anyways.

Learning to keep things in perspective, and making informed, sound decisions is worth every penny of that $246.",1,0,1614699683,Rynofskie
