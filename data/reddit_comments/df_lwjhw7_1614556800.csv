57,gphxmt9,"Ehhh theoretically “efficient market” blah blah blah it doesn’t matter. You could argue a) yes it’s better your strike is lower or b) once this goes ex the trade is over 
I have no idea. But just wanted people to be aware. Don’t think “oh I’ll buy puts and I get an extra $1.11 in my favor bc it will fall by that amount.” 
Also I’d be wary of getting in complicated spread trades, sometimes liquidity dries up after a strike adjustment

59,gphywvb,"I agree that the screams of market manipulation get old on every drop of every stock. I also understand that sometimes things seem fishy as well. When it was picking up steam big this afternoon twice it hit $42 or so and crashed hard into halts. You are talking a +$4 drop in short time window to trigger that. Those were huge selloffs that fortunately didn't hold and it takes some serious volume to do that.

It rebounded nicely from both of them and there was huge volume all afternoon so the price seems to have support. I still think the original thesis around RKT this week is solid but whenever we get these extreme upswings it makes me nervous, but anytime you throw momentum in with some catalysts it can happen. I would definitely not complain if we see a 70% gain again tomorrow though.",4,0,1614744822,jlschwefel
