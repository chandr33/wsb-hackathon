2,gphbt1a,Earnings call will be a dumpster fire surrounded by a prayer circle,4,0,1614732756,watchthegaps
3,gphbz5n,"The downside: the Announcement will likely not be bullish.

The upside: AMC has survived this pandemic and will emerge stronger and primed to make us all a fuck ton of tendies.

We need only wait for the inevitable windfall.",6,0,1614732842,sandygws
4,gphc24q,Ha. More apes will probably just buy the dip. I did have 50 shares at $2 and sold at $4 should’ve held till $8-10 and it was too volatile to trade out at $20 it would’ve dipped before i logged on.,2,0,1614732885,lonedrifter1989

6,gphcngb,I went on their site today and they are doing a live webcast for the earnings call. Might be retarded but why would you do a webcast for a shitty earnings report?,2,0,1614733189,boogeyman616
7,gphco2y,"You’re not wrong. The actual earnings are probably complete shit. But honestly, the earnings weren’t going to have much influence on the price anyway. Everyone already knows the earnings will be complete shit. That’s no big secret. 

So any price move will based on what they have to say about the future. AMC has, thus far, staved off bankruptcy and the board has even deemed it reasonable to pay out millions of dollars in bonuses. So I would say, at a minimum, that is a positive indication about what Management thinks the future holds.

Now I’m not saying AMC is a rocket ship, but it could move higher if Management has a solid plan for the future.",6,0,1614733199,McPowPow

9,gphdy63,All that matters is if earnings are better than expected. And everyone knows they weren’t open so expectations are low. Beat that and it is a positive.,1,0,1614733867,HoosierUnderTheRadar
