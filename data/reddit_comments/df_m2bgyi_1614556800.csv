They are propped on hype, you can‚Äôt DD them.

18,gqibi7o,I think they hoped if they tanked all the meme stocks then a bunch of degenerates would all get margin called. Then they get liquidated and it precipitates the price further down all while picking off stop losses and shaking out paper hands,3,0,1615419436,holdmetendy

If I was a whale that wanted to start the squeeze, what do I need to overcome to get there?  Shorts maybe?  And how do I stop the shorts?  The easiest way would be to sell a bunch of stock today all at once, dump the price, and in doing so get GME onto the Short Sale Restricted list for tomorrow, then buy like crazy in the morning.  Boom, squeeze initiated.  That could be why it's trading flat tonight as well.  Saving up for tomorrow for the biggest impact.‚Äã",5,0,1615419618,chiefoogabooga

31,gqidrvo,"I was thinking, which is rare.

But, what if shorts were buying since Monday, why the steady rise in price.  Then today they paid back a buttload of shares and whoever they paid them to promptly dumped them at 1220.

The would also account for the steep rise today, as they bought up the final lot they needed to pay off their borrowed shares.",4,0,1615420626,WizzingonWallStreet
32,gqie3xk,"Maybe, but whoever did it, it was intentional.  Someone with enough cash to have that many shares is rich.  And rich people generally aren't stupid.

https://www.sec.gov/answers/shortrestrict.htm

&gt;	In February 2010 the Commission adopted a new short sale price test restriction, which is commonly referred to as the ‚Äúalternative uptick rule.‚Äù  The alternative uptick rule is designed to restrict short selling from further driving down the price of a stock that has dropped more than 10 percent in one day compared to the closing price on the previous day.",1,0,1615421019,nerd4tech
