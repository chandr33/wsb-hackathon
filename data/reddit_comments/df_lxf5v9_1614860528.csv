73,gpncqpk,"I think you're right about the symptoms but you've misdiagnosed the cause. Back in those days, you could stay with a single company and manage your bills just fine until you retired with a nice pension. Now, though, chances are you won't stay at your first career for more than five years (at least if you want a decent raise that keeps up with cost of living) and you better hope they match your 401k contributions if you ever want a way out.

It just doesn't feel like we're working *toward* anything anymore. There's no end in sight for most of us, and we are working in these atomized roles where we don't even see the fruits of our labor, let alone how our labor makes society a better place. 

Where do we go from there? That's what we all have to decide, I guess. I think that this will necessitate a greater focus on worker's rights, but I know this isn't likely the place for that discussion.",11,0,1614863084,grapefruitmixup

88,gpndc3x,"See, I considered taking that choice once. Worst night of my life. There was exactly one person left who I felt actually cared about me, and they were powerless to help. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I didn't go through with it. I didn't have to tell the emergency operator to send someone to take me to the mental ward. But I did, and I'm here. 

Frankly, after suffering through all of the bullshit up to this point, I'm determined to make it worthwhile. I'm finally back on my feet now, and I don't hear no fucking bell. 

If you're suffering right now, understand that there are people who have been there. Go to bed and get some sleep, and understand that everything will be just fine, alright? You'll wake up tomorrow, do your research for your next course of action, and start working toward your future. There's nothing else for it. 

Someone has been where you are, and there will be a solution you can use and mistakes others have made that you can learn from. The internet is a fantastic resource. Take a day or two and chart your course. Call your mom. Hug your wife's boyfriend. Breathe. Overcoming this will be something you look back on with pride.
