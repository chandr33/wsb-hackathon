12,gpkkk6h,"Do you even know what the fuck you're talking about? There's a difference between the two, and you can't have both.

An IPO is when a company issues new shares for the public, which is underwritten by an intermediary, usually an investment bank. 

A DPO is where the company sells existing shares directly to the public without needing any intermediaries by allowing existing investors and employees to sell their shares to the public.

In that same article, if you actually read through it, here's what it says:

*""...The business had planned a traditional IPO but the SEC approved a change in the IPO rules to allow direct floor listings without underwriters...* *In the Roblox direct listing, the business will sell 198.9 million shares of common stock on March 10. The DPO means that Roblox’s opening price will be set by the buy orders the exchange receives rather than underwriters setting the price.""*",2,0,1614809063,ChillOUT_LoFi
