2,gqhnntp,This should have been discussed months ago but sub rules prevent most of these from even being brought up. 1000% gains on several of these in last 6 months.,7,0,1615408487,Churningfordollars

6,gqhqhfr,"If you‚Äôre just in it for the money then ignore me. But if you care deeply for these substances and the future of their use, then I share a lot of my concerns in a video here https://youtu.be/-l-WyBjJsNw if you‚Äôre interested. Namely worried about how for profits could negatively affect decriminalization and accessibility, open science in psychedelic research, and quality of psych therapy.",2,0,1615409670,nu-hippie

Edit: I watched it and skipped around, I couldn‚Äôt really sit through it. If you were just bouncing your own mind off the camera then that‚Äôs fine, but none of your arguments‚Äîif there were any‚Äîwere convincing. You could flesh out more of your moral grounds other than ‚Äúcapitalism is bad‚Äù. I think you contradict yourself when you advocate for decriminalization but then broadly put down any attempt at regulating HOW it will be managed on the large scale, which is inevitable. If you are going to fly the liberal/moral flag, I think it helps to ground the idealism a bit more. I know I watch other YouTubera with an open mind to learn, but, again, if you were just sharing your own personal thoughts and that‚Äôs it, then cool.

Also, your comment above: what you mentioned as the main concerns of the video I don‚Äôt think were addressed at all, it was more you just complaining, I think. (Not in a rude way, just expressing your dissent for capitalism)",2,0,1615411280,cagreene
