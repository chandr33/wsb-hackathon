17,gpj1530,"Medicare advantage health care companies‚Äô revenues are based off of their star ratings and how many gaps they close. A gap is when a patient is not optimized, like when diabetic patients aren‚Äôt on the right medications. Clover is trash. https://cdn.cloverhealth.com/filer_public/3f/a2/3fa2a3d9-7edd-4e50-885f-39a7e13f5479/h5141_20ex016l_stars_eng_v3.pdf they aren‚Äôt even close to a top performing MA plan. They are an extremely poor performer. Look up ‚Äúinsurance company‚Äù star rating to see how the overall plan measures based on objective assessments. Aetna, UNH, literally every other health plan performs better than clover. 

The other way they increase revenue is by increasing membership. 

Many of these MA companies are geographically isolated and have a really hard time expanding outside their primary coverage area because of how aggressive and protective they are of each other. 

There are non geographic competitors like devoted, oscar, chenmed and too many to name. 

Their EHR platform and ‚ÄúAI‚Äù analytics are just buzzwords. AI is standard of care in this level of analytics. All companies, including incumbents like aetna/UNH, use them.",-2,0,1614775895,INeverHaveMoney
