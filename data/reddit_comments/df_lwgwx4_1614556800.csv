18,gphe2kc,Problem with that is my go to is usually tesla and I ain't fucking around on margin.,1,0,1614733932,slampig3
19,gphfzu4,So the rule is there b/ it‚Äôs not actually your money. When you buy and then sell you have a couple days befor the clearing house does it‚Äôs thing and you have the money back. The broker is fronting you In the meantime of you have a margin account. If you keep your account to cash (note RH doesn‚Äôt count b/ that‚Äôs actually a margin act for the outposts of this) you don‚Äôt have any limitations but you will run out of money quick if your trading a big % of your stack). Hope that clears it up. It‚Äôs still a stupid rule but that‚Äôs logic behind part it‚Äôs purpose.,2,0,1614734926,KyFly1
