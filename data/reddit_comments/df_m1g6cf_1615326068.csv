34,gqdl4sl,"You buy the option to purchase 100 shares of a stock at your strike price. That doesn't matter though, most retards here just buy it and then try to sell it back to someone else once the stock crawls up and the premium goes up with it.I would say that probably about 95% of the people on here have never even or don't even know how to exercise a call option. so if I were you, I would just go ahead and buy a call option. You basically spend a certain amount of money which would be considered this call options extrinsic value, and then you hope that the extrinsic value increases so then you could sell it. What you have to worry about is theta decay which is the extrinsic value of the call option reducing over time as well as intrinsic value which means the stocks overall price going down. But honestly, if I were you, I would choose a somewhat cheap stock like BB or AMC, and then buy a call or put option and then see where it goes. You will naturally pick up on the flow of things as you lose money lol, or maybe you'll pick a winner who knows",1,0,1615326111,barelyrolling42069v2
