7,gqf7kwl,"I've found an unlimited money cheat code for GME. Buy OTM calls on Mon which expire on Fri, then sell them. IV doesn't even matter because of the time crunch and insane daily spikes. Then sell them Fri. Rinse and repeat. Do this until the squeeze ends. 

Is this beyond stupid? Absolutely. Only the most insane, risk-tolerant apes should do this. NEVER sell your GME shares to do this. Only use the money you're already making off the calls. That's money you should be willing to lose anyways. It's a high-risk, high-reward play. Time to gamble.",1,0,1615359783,Xadma24
