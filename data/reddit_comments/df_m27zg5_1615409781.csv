2,gqhqqv1,"i can't get over how insanely conspiracy it sounds, but these ups and downs are without a doubt the HFs doing what they can to scrape every last penny out before the end. highs, lows, sideways, none of that matters, they're criminals and they'll keep doing it until it blows up again. HOW IS IT NOT MANIPULATION when i can just 'borrow' shares and tank all the momentum in one minute, coordinated with news outlets, as we've seen the examples. and not a single peep anywhere else, how is it ok that they can just stack all this against us?",61,0,1615409782,Average_guy_here

It dropped so quick and halted so much I wouldn't have even been able to sell if I wanted to and any stop limit wouldn't have hit because it plummeted below the limit too fast. The whole thing happened over like a 20 minute span. Like if u just didn't look at the chart you'd think ""nice a 10% increase on the day"". So wierd.

This makes them willing to shill for big money. First they published articles on Forbes calling us predators attacking a cornered and defenseless animals. (We're the bad guys for preventing a predatory hedgefund from killing off a company by shorting the shit out of it for profit), then they dont report when we're up 60%, but they immediately report the 40% drop. 

And marketwatches Wallace Witkowski even managed to fuck that up by putting the articles online minutes before the crash even happened. Proving collusion between Wallstreet and financial media.
