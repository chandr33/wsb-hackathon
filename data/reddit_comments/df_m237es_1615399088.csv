## We are going to hit the all-time-high repeatedly.

## They need to cycle the same shares over and over to close all their positions since they're over 100%.

## So they're dumping the shares to drill the price and using puts and calls to play both sides.

## Basically, I think we are going to have a bunch of multiple ""short squeezes"" rather than one massive one

## So going forward I'm going to be playing this stock under this assumption.",24,0,1615399090,lurkwhenbored
