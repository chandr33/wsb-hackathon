3,gqhso4t,"Easy solutions:
- don't sell until we squeeze. 
- don't get tricked into a stop loss, either be prepared for all or nothing.

I bought 100 more shares at around 200 when the halt lifted.",28,0,1615410623,woods4me
4,gqhszyw,The problem is they will never cover at 350 when they can manipulate the price. They have too much control to let this work. They hold far to many shares for this to work that‚Äôs the difference in this and VW. VW wasn‚Äôt telegraphed allowing the shorts to hold shares and manipulate the price. They only needed a 400k volume to drop the price from 350 to 190. They‚Äôre laughing in their lambos,-6,0,1615410768,Wiletj1

7,gqht5iu,Need that stimulus money now!!!!,2,0,1615410835,Blitzkreig11930
8,gqhtf8b,Yes but they made over 100% and are doing it by tossing us 6%. We can never win when they know our plan. No war has ever been won by telling the opponent your strategy. They win and we think we are. They‚Äôve already made far more money than 10k$ a share would make us.,1,0,1615410955,Wiletj1

11,gqhtvia,Dude we‚Äôre fighting a losing battle. We had this whole thing won and they said fuck the rules we will just pay the 50 million dollar fine (IF they even get charged) to make BILLIONS manipulating the market.,2,0,1615411155,Wiletj1

13,gqhu0ek,It‚Äôs not outsmarting them that‚Äôs what they want. They‚Äôre making money on the way up and on the way down and laughing at us thinking we‚Äôre winning. He who controls the price controls the market. Today‚Äôs swing proved they control the price.,-2,0,1615411215,Wiletj1

18,gqhukjy,Are you fucking retarded or do you have any idea what the rule changes are? They are going to be forced to pay up or be consolidated. Not to mention 3/19 is a quadruple witching day. They're panicking right now cuz time is running out. They're fucked and you're dumb,4,0,1615411459,hdavis42
19,gqhunpo,"If you‚Äôre here to make money, congrats you did, and will probably make more tomorrow.

If you‚Äôre here for war, you‚Äôll probably leave with a gaping asshole. We all saw what the big boys are capable of in January.

24,gqhvbdu,"Not gonna lie I paper handed 1/4 of my shares, doubled my initial investment and still have skin in the game. If you aren‚Äôt playing the game with the Hedges you deserve to hold the bag.....brain is smooth like a grape, no advice just opinion",0,0,1615411783,Football-Financial
25,gqhvlq4,I held from 350 to 40 back to 350. Call me a shill all you want but people need to know they‚Äôve already made more money than the short will ever make. There is no move the game is fucking rigged.,0,0,1615411906,Wiletj1
26,gqhvp7r,It‚Äôs the reality. The game is rigged. They make money up and down. But shares let us drive the price up then short and sell shares causing a sell off then cover and buy more shares and repeat. It‚Äôs so blatant yet I get called a shill.,0,0,1615411948,Wiletj1

29,gqhwu6c,I‚Äôve been in this thing since the day before they restricted trading. I spent thousands in fees to liquidate my Merrill Lynch account because of this bullshit. I dealt with multiple 20k loss days. Why can‚Äôt you just realize that I‚Äôm seeing how they‚Äôre winning these fucks are making BILLIONS on trade volume alone. I could give a fuck less if you hold or sell I hope every retail investor makes millions but we also need to see when they‚Äôre fucking winning.

32,gqhxm2d,Thank you man. It‚Äôs ridiculous I‚Äôm getting called a shill look at my post history if you want. I lost close to 100k because of these fuckers rigging the game.

33,gqhxm4w,"Negative. You're not on my team because there is no team. I don't know this pimple.
