3,gqdit77,Realistically “when this is over” you guys think anything over 20 is possible? That might be my cashout too. Earlier this year DURING the pandemic it spiked in late January at 19.90. I might be able to see it go higher but not for long at all,-16,0,1615325080,AKA_DavidKoresh

And you're not helping your case by saying what it hit during the pandemic; it'll only go higher outside of the pandemic.

11,gqdw294,You do what you want to do. If that’s $20 then sure. But I’ve been in these squeeze situations before and there always is a point where you think it’s not going ok info more than 100% gain. You do as I once did and sell at a good profit only to be unable to buy in again because there is no more dip and it 10x’s before you know it... and you don’t have any more shares to cash in on it.,2,0,1615331279,jdrukis
