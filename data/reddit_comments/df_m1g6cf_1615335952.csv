49,gqe56o5,Correct. However if your call goes in the money there's a chance your broker could exercise it for you at market close on the expiration date. In that case you could get rekt if the underlying stock price drops in value the next trading day because you are now a proud owner of a shitload of shares. I've never seen this happened but when I was new this is how it was explained to me. Just make sure to sell your contracts before the closing bell on expiration day.
