9,gpg6oy1,You can't fill an order when market is closed. By open this morning the value had changed and cost way more than your bid,2,0,1614713725,DefiEconomics
10,gpg6q6b,Yeah by time the market opened your bid was was too low. Option prices don’t adjust in the aftermarket so you shouldn’t expect for your order to automatically get filled.,1,0,1614713739,BBWInvader

31,gpg7mm8,"Difference is that if the options trade even 1 cent above your limit, you will NOT get it.  Even if you hit the price right, the people ahead of you will get filled first and there may not be enough left for you.  If you place a market order, it will get filled without waiting.  Danger: MM will punish you once in a while being that aggressive.....  i do place market orders 95% of the time. I do not like limit orders.",1,0,1614714130,oilbossman
