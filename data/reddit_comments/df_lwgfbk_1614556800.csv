55,gphclk3,"I highly recommend doing your own DD. It‚Äôs not a good idea to just ‚Äúfollow the pack‚Äù when it comes to investing. Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the ‚Äúwe talk‚Äù you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. 

If you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. 

As far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. 

I have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. 

Another major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren‚Äôt realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It‚Äôs great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it‚Äôs not real.
