97,gqejhbi,"Seeing the consumption levels go up, having more people trying it as it becomes normalized,  and especially having more young people is what scares me the most. It probably wont be worse on lungs or cancers compared to cigarettes but the mental issues could turn out to become a problem. Hopefully not. 

Its hard to link these two not knowing much on your situation but it is known that it can trigger some mental issues some mild to some wild ones, even scizophrenia for the people who are pre disposed to these conditions. 

Im a weed smoker in the process of stopping, failed my last attempt, and after over 20 years im pretty sure it may have affected the way my brain works.

Like,  I like that it can boost my serotonin, but if im always artificielly high on serotonin from weed, the day i go back to normal levels, im probably going to be in a bad mood. And then, can my brain even produce enough of it on its own. 

I know for sure that there are many upsides to push weed for its multiple properties but im really not so sure about how it will turn out in a few decades. 

As if peoples brains werent fucked enough already with the repeated micro dopamine boosts from social networks, now well see how it does with normalizing weed.
