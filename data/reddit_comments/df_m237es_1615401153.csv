13,gqh657r,"laddering involves selling small, odd lots back and forth at below market price.  You can't effect huge changes with a ladder attack because if you drop it low, other limit buys will snatch the orders up.  Laddering down applies constant downward pressure.

Dumping 4.5M shares in 15 seconds is not a ladder attack. It floods supply side which tanks price.

But if they published at 12:43 it likely would have had to gone thru some sort of proof reading and editing process I would think.  

It really does bring up the question of how did the author know it would be halted 5 times between that time frame when they were likely done writing around 12:30pm  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)",1,0,1615401156,Damiklos
