Personally, I feel the stock is going to remain volatile for another month or so regardless. I am smoothbrain",14,0,1615321404,Tailend22

14,gqdiaz3,"To some degree, the % of short interest doesn't matter.  Theoretically, a 1% short interest can still squeeze if no one is selling at a price below the short target price. However,  that scenario is highly unlikely. The higher the short float %, the harder it is to cover all the shorted shares, as the short sellers need to find more stock to buy at reasonable prices. So high short float stocks are most vulnerable to a squeeze, but it comes down to a certain ratio of short float % vs. the number of shareholders willing to sell at a certain price point. Also, most short sellers borrow their shares, and are under contract to give them back by a certain time. So they have to buy the shares back at some point. If the price hasn't dropped to what they expected, then they have to pay more to buy back than what they paid to borrow. Multiply this times millions of shares and the price sky rockets as more and more investors in short positions have to buy back to limit their potential losses.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: Low short float % stocks can still squeeze. The higher the short interest %, the more likely there will not be enough sellers to for the shorts to cover their calls at low prices by the time they have to pay the shares back.",1,0,1615324859,balynevil

16,gqdqz39,"I like that here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true\_short\_interest\_in\_gee\_em\_ee\_could\_be/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  we have a post going DEEP on short interest, edging everyone with big numbers üöÄüí¶, and then the top comment basically just says nah that's not how it works. Top comment account Verb0182 has some interesting comments in interesting threads if anyone wants to try to DD on their DD. Again, I'm not shilling, me and my 13.1 shares would fucking love a Lambo, but I'm just trying to make an informed decision for myself on the future value of these shares. I knowww these guys are literal criminals that will do anything to hold onto their private jets and the manipulation/artificial shares are real, but I'm still not sure I can buy into the case for a second short squeeze. Contrarian views seem to be that the squeeze has indeed squozed but now the big boy $ players are just riding the hype wave to see how high they can push it and taking us all along for the ride.",1,0,1615328830,davymont
