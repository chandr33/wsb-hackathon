12,gqe1kbo,"AMC is likely opening back up in LA next week, so it *should* continue a gradual climb, but I too am a smooth brained ape so who knows.

Wish I had bought more than 35 shares @ $8.10, but gainz is gainz.",3,0,1615334111,TurdsforNipples
13,gqe1lrg,"Bought 10 @ 14 last time around, picked up 40 more at 8 this time around. Looking forward to the 9:45 dip tomorrow to hopefully pick up some more, they just look juicy and tender at the moment to me.

I personally don't see a point in selling them. I like their long term outlook.",2,0,1615334132,dullsmile1

18,gqe1nyv,Holding 100 @ 4.65 sold some 3/12 $8 and 3/19 $10 calls this this afternoon for some gains.  Bought some protective puts incase this goes tits up.  Will add more shares in the AM and hold for all my retarded brothers and sisters that are sitting on unrealized losses right now.  I'm hoping shitty earnings after hours tomorrow doesn't make 🧻🙌 bitches start selling.  I just like the stock. Good luck retards.,0,0,1615334165,ContestImpressive
