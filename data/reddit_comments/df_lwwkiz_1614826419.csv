18,gpmvgcb,"I’m genuinely confused. All the GME DD I’ve seen is bullish. Any bearish ideals I’ve seen have been comments like this. 

I would 100000% appreciate someone like you posting bearish GME DD. I think the community would be better for it. 

If all you’ve got is a sentence or two, I understand, but I’d love to see an opposing position to all this 100k is not a meme shit. The shill spam is getting old. Post your DD, and thank you.",2,0,1614848352,heavydisme
