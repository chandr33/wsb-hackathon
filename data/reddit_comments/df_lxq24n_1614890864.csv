49,gppfk6r,"Lol let's see total returns 5y from now... RKT will kick UWMC's ass. Think I'm wrong? Look at my comment history and you'll see I actually know what I'm doing. I was in GME months before 99% of people here and used those gains to get lots of RKT. And you know what? I bought more RKT today... Will remain minimum 20% of my portfolio until it hits $50 within 12 months and will rotate back in following any significant weakness during the housing off-cycle IF Rocket Auto hasn't already grown enough to counter the cyclical risk in the stock by then. UWMC might have a good run in the next 6 months but we will exit the hot housing cycle before long and that's when RKT will continue to add share, increasing gains when the new cycle hits. Rocket Homes will expand and not only take originations from UWMC, but also cut into Zillow as well.

Feel free to down vote me since UWMC gang is being misled and everyone is an ape in the sub now, but you may want to listen if you like money.

Looks like UWMC is about to go to war with RKT. This should be interesting. And its a fairly smart play of theres. Since they primarily deal with brokers. I did talk to my realtor and asked if she has ever had any experience with them and she said they close fast and typically people are happy with them. So I got my confirmation bias.

87,gppu4bj,"As someone who as worked at both companies I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with all you are saying regarding the companies (not talking about it from a stock price short or long) but typically when rates go up, broker volume declines. UWM is all brokers. Yes QL is a refi shop,  but they are diversified with other relationships like morgan Stanley, State Farm, Schwab and they do relocation. QL margins are banging compared to UWM because as you indicated originators get a percentage of the loan (bps) but that‚Äôs the broker not the agent at UWM. At QL they pay by units to the loan officer on top of their ungodly margins. I think UWM has ascended to a point where they are not going anywhere given their growth over the last 7 years, but QL will be in the black during hard times where UWM might suffer more from margin compression in a more competitive interest rate market. At the end of the day mortgage stocks have historically been shit and no one wanted to trade them so everyone going public is really just an attempt to cash out after a record year and likely buy back stock when rates are 5% again.
