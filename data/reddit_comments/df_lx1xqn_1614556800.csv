5,gpkgbfk,"AMD is undervalued but Intel is a sleeping giant and it’s biggest issue. So while I think it’s undervalued, not by much. All tech stocks are taking a shit right now. I assume because of the talked about “microchip shortage.” I think now is a great time to buy tech slanted stocks. I believe AMD will see some growth but be eclipsed and left in the shadow of others when the supply/demand areas of the market start to settle.",1,0,1614799567,iThinkBlue

As a long term hold, go nuts chip IP holders have the world by the balls and will always be worth something. Short term? Other guys are winding up for the next punch, proceed with caution.",1,0,1614800212,beauchh
13,gpkhuq3,"It really depends on what happens in the future in terms of new chip sets and cards. The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.

Looking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.

With the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well. A stock price of $250+ is not out of the question imo.",6,0,1614800213,italiangreenbeans

19,gpkjcj1,"I think it’s overvalued and will likely return to similar pre-covid levels. The market just started the correction, most think its a crash but it might not be. Two states have already reopened and the rest of the Republicans will likely follow since they’re cucks. While this may fracture the rhetoric and blur states may stay closed, with the vaccine being ready by may, we will likely be fully open by June. I’m betting 70$ AMD price. Was 60 precovid, but I don’t expect a full sell off.",-1,0,1614800854,Ahhhgghghg
20,gpkjqrm,"AMD used to be undervalued. They may be slightly undervalued now due to people cashing out during this mining craze in preparation for the inevitable flood of used cards coming back into the market and killing revenue, but they're still floating around the right price looking at TSMC's capacity and AMD's forward projections. AMD themselves are looking at 2025 before they grow past their current value. If you're just talking memes I guess they have room to grow but I think sentiment has been turning against them due to absurd GPU prices.

Saying amd is the most innovative graphics card company is just plain crazy. They caught up to nvidia in raster performance thanks to completely dropping their compute architecture in favor of raster performance, yet they're only about nvidia level of performance even after losing significant efficiency in compute. Meanwhile you've got nvidia slapping on RT/Tensor with every gpu, codeveloping PAM4 memory and somehow managing to still provide similar raster. Catching up to your competitor by stripping utility is not innovative.

If anything AMD is being carried by its innovative CPU designs pushing chiplets years before intel while intel is praying 3dstacking closes the gap. Their GPU division however just constantly struggles and has yet to ship a competitive instinct GPU. They've basically given up on competing with nvidia in enterprise and instead are taking intel's scientific compute market with high FP64 gpus. It's led to some big supercomputer wins but overall their GPU division hasn't pushed the envelope since the 290x. Honestly I'm surprised that cray believes they will ship Frontier on schedule since AMD's instinct GPUs barely even exist, but they said they're on schedule so maybe AMD's gpu division has bigger improvements on the horizon for 5nm.",3,0,1614801026,topdangle
21,gpkjz0d,"I own a few Ryzen chips. I like AMD as a consumer. But as an investor they don’t stand a chance against Nvidia or Intel respectively. Intel has been relatively quiet in recent years while it slowly perfects its smaller nm chip process. And, nvidia really changed the ratio of price to performance for the better with the 30series cards. Tough world out there for AMD. Not because they suck but because those other two companies are fucking amazing at what they do.",1,0,1614801125,iThinkBlue

33,gpkp85a,"I’m very bullish on AMD and I plan to hold shares on it for a long time but my only problem is that they need to solve their production issues before intel releases their own CPUs that are on par with the current AMD CPUs.

Every expert's opinion that I can find points to INTC failing to compete with AMD until 2023 at the earliest.  The only question is, can TSM keep them in chips?  From the GPU standpoint, they are the best bang for the buck that you can get.  CPUs are pretty much the same thing except now they own the higher tier product and are getting better margins while INTC settles for lower cost, lower margin CPUs.",2,0,1614813266,Ben_Frank_Lynn

&gt;Graphics cards are in extremely high demand right and AMD is one of the only companies with the ability to provide that commodity. I understand there are other companies producing the same product, but AMD has the highest rate of innovation among all of the graphics card companies

this demonstrates both a lack of knowledge on WHY they're in demand and also their competitors.
