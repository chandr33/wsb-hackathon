4,gpnjrve,"I was with you till you said the fed would issue bonds. Huh, wha? Since when does the Fed issue bonds? The Fed buys bonds, thus inflating their prices and lowering yields (interest rate paid on the bond). Prices move inverse to yields. The Fed needs to do this, because if they don‚Äôt, the treasury starts paying much more in interest. Remember those variable rate mortgages that fueled the housing crash? Same concept. While you can afford 1% interest just fine, at 4% you‚Äôre fucked. That‚Äôs the problem for the Treasury and Fed. There is no good way out. It‚Äôs inflation or sovereign bond crisis. So far for the past decade, they have chosen inflation. My bet is that even as inflation goes up, they won‚Äôt do shit to stop it and when rates creep up, they will respond to lower them. The alternative is unthinkable.",1,0,1614867016,VtechX
5,gpnkx13,"The reason behind the ROR being so high is that it was such an unknown. Few people knew about it, and fewer still believed in it as a store of value.

6,gpnlgo2,"Yes, rising rates means lower valuation of existing low-rate bonds relative to new higher rate issues, driving prices down and yields further up. The Fed issuing more higher rate bonds will not create new cash inflows, but will move cash out of existing bonds into new higher rate issues, contributing to further yield rises (as outlined above). An ETF however is not holding a bond, but a selection of bonds. A US bond ETF's value relies on both the valuation of the bond market and the relative value of the dollar, as well as market confidence in the Fed's forward looking policy, its constituent holdings and its management. You are exposing yourself to bonds held by the fund manager, rather than owning the bonds themselves, so you can be somewhat protected from duration or default risk, however you remain exposed to fluctuations in macro market sentiment and do not have the guaranteed principle as when holding the bond itself (an ETF can lose 100% of its value). The underlying manager has the capacity to trade in bonds while you hold the same ETF, so its relative success versus the market depends on the activity of the manager. This depends on the riskiness and activity level of the Fund. A less active fund with lower risk will generally trade less outside its benchmark and in fact be more susceptible to market-aligned losses. With bond ETFs they will also balance the duration of their bonds or be fixed duration (10y, 5y, 30y etc) meaning they will be valued differently.

The likelihood is that the value of the ETF will fall as the market panics (already happening) and leaves the market or opportunistically moves into higher rate issues, but that the manager has the potential to reduce loss with trading activity depending on their philosophy, fund design and outlook.",3,0,1614867885,BaconPancakes1

Wouldn't increasing the interest rate then increase his much the US national debt is growing?  I thought that the bonds interest rate was the same interest rate the US pays on all of it's debt.  I have been thinking that the stock market has been inflated because interest rates are hot garbage and, as you said, investors make no money on bonds compared to stock, so everyone and their wife's boyfriend has been dumping their money into stock vs bonds. 

With the US national debt increasing by ~$10T (I think) due to covid, I would imagine the feds would want to keep interest rates low, since higher interest rate means more debt. 

I'm not disagreeing with the assessment that rising the interest rate would allow people to shift to bonds, but I'm wondering the increased national debt plays into your ideas.

Interestingly though, now we see inflation but only in certain sectors. Collectibles (Hockey cards, pokemon, classic cars etc), housing, stocks, some building materials like lumber. We have not yet seen inflation in food or everyday goods so it doesnt appear that we actually have inflation, but we do, its here.

What OP pointed out is that when money velocity picks up, inflation runs rampant. So when vaccines roll out and everyone starts going back to normal, inflation hits hard and fast. Inflation has barely moved so bar because the money velocity has decreased so much with covid.

43,gpo69mw,"1) We have not been in deflation. The rate of inflation has been surprisingly low given the extreme amount of monetary and fiscal action in response to two recessions and the wealthy demanding tax cuts

2) Yes, Covid increased deficit spending but even before then Trump increased the deficit from $400-600B (whatever base year your ideology sways you to choose) to over $1.6 TRILLION prior to Covid and during a period of growth. The complete opposite of what you should do. Even then, inflation barely budged. 

3) The velocity of money has shown to be a less and less essential variable over the last 10 years (I believe a factor of income and wealth inequality). We‚Äôve seen enormous injections of money into the economy, but it‚Äôs not flowing to the average person and thus not increasing velocity significantly 

4) Housing prices increased because of an extreme housing shortage. The rate of 20-40yos who make up the housing market is at its lowest level in a generation. Maybe even two. 

Your point that once Covid is done, the increase in normal spending will resume and increase the velocity of money thus increasing inflation rapidly runs in complete contrast to what we‚Äôve seen in the last decade. It‚Äôs again, people who have the most basic level of understanding of economic tools (QE, FED actions, federal stimulus, formulas designed to help students understand how inflation works in the context of vacuums) ignoring the variables of our current economic condition

Right now yields are higher because the economy is expected to recover. People buy bonds when they lose faith in equities thus moving the price of the asset up and decreasing the yield. There are other buyers who always buy because they are forced to buy bonds since their retirement fund has a mandate to do so or because it's better than holding cash. Banks were forced to hold bonds according to rules since the 08 recession which count towards their reserve requirement (so fed could buy it back to print money) but all that got thrown out since covid and may not be back for ages since the Fed realised they do not actually have to securitize their debt. We're getting into modern monetary theory so let's leave it at that.

You are hearing about the yield increasing becoming a problem because if they become high bonds become desirable again and/or nobody will loan you money for stupid cheap since they can get that risk free. Fed does not have to 'raise' anything and they won't as said many times. Fed has a dual mandate, stable prices and full employment. If you read the Fed minutes from Feb they are expecting inflation in the short them which will average to their target inflation in the longer term. They specify that they won't stop easing for years and until they are happy with the unemployment rate. They can also cap yields if they want to issue more bonds.
