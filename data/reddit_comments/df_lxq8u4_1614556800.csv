1,gpohghx,"Well the *current* price of GME is $120.50 so.

Point is none of us know shit about fuck. We're making a **bet** and we are confident that our bet pays off. But it's still a bet, and it's based on a lot of assumptions that are based on information we have no way of knowing is accurate (mainly short interest), because the market for some reason doesn't have to disclose accurate short information at any point ever.",78,0,1614881929,AJDillonsMiddleLeg

6,gpojbsa,"I wouldn't be so naive to say I think the price would never go below $124, but I do believe it will quickly gravitate back to $124, and consistently close within the proximity of that baseline, and eventually higher. Specifically, as long as this big dawg has \~$116MM attached to that price point. 

Considering half of the market is seeing 10% or more in regression today, I don't think this whale, or anyone else long on GME should be very concerned about a \~2% drop.",41,0,1614882707,BigBrainBets

15,gpoqidv,"Read the post I linked. Or take the smooth-brain approach and look at the timestamps on the purchases here:

 [GME Biggest Options Trades 3/2 - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qp2phEm) 

 [Gamestonk options 3/1 - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/8ZCd3b9)  

They are all block purchases executed at the same exact time or very close in proximity, all purchased from the same exchange, and there are no other similar transactions for deep ITM calls of this magnitude.

Thus we can infer its the same buyer. Sure, it is still possible they aren't all the same buyer, but that's much less probable when considering the data we have, IMO. Particularly the ones executed at the same millisecond.",11,0,1614885715,BigBrainBets

21,gpoxf2l,"To be honest, I don't. No one except the buyer knows.

But I think the issue with shorts engaging in this type of activity is the immense amount of volatility making these ITM options so expensive. For example, our big player here forked out &gt;100M for just the opportunity to buy 942,500 shares.

If my math is correct, they would lose somewhere around \~$1M every time the price drops a dollar below their break even..... I don't think this makes any sense for a short who wants to acquire and subsequently dump shares. Although, as they offload shares it would be a staggered decline in terms of loss for each sell, depending on how the market reacts.

Even if they have to buyback shares, is that worth it? I guess it could be... For example, if they took a loss of $50M on an options bet like this but were able to influence the market enough to start a big sell off and save money on their current short positions. But that seems unlikely, and extremely tough to predict given the way retailers and Apes have continued to hold strong, and continue to buy more on the dips.

That being said, I think the only person/entity who would make this type of play, and assume such risk, is someone who is genuinely confident in going long on GME. Likely someone who knows it is bound to rise well above their $124.01 breakeven.",18,0,1614888547,BigBrainBets

42,gppk1v0,"Only the calls denoted with an * expire in over a year from now; a very small amount of the overall options. The vast majority expire next month on April 16.

The buyer will lose give/take ~$1M for every dollar it drops below $124. If, as your hypothetical proposes, it drops to $40 anytime soon, this buyer will be massively fucked if they have to pray the price returns to $124 within the next 40 or so days. 

With that in mind, they'll vigorously defend that breakeven threshold to keep the public sentiment up, thus, saving themselves from the pain of a massive sell off. In the meantime, this holds the line while they wait out the presumed squeeze which they probably envision taking place before their metric-fuckton of options expire on 4/16. 

This is extremely bullish for anyone long on GME.",5,0,1614898495,BigBrainBets
