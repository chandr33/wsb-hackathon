1,gqcllqo,They held it down below 8 on friday for sure.  It crossed below 8 like 10 separate times in one day.  I had options expire worthless too.  I was so fucking pissed and got double fucking pissed when it gapped up monday morning.  I have a strong feeling the big boys were accumulating last week.,1,0,1615310170,stilloriginal
