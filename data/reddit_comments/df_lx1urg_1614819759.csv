2,gplouau,"What? I'm talking about the posts and the way people talk. Also you're just wrong, RKT has a 110m float, the other 1.9B are just insider shares sitting in Gilbert's portfolio, and they aren't going anywhere. For the purposes of a squeeze, they don't exist.

The point is if you look at anything with the mindset of conspiracy, you'll find something be suspicious about, when usually the true explanation is just something simple and boring. RKT had awesome DD, and what happened was basically what people had hoped for and predicted. No conspiracy. The media covered an extreme share price spike that involved reddit hype in the exact way you'd expect them to. No conspiracy..",6,0,1614820776,CoachKrab

21,gpp7t13,Lmao imagine thinking that the majority of the market dipping is indicative of the value on two specific stocksüòÇüòÇ,1,0,1614892935,Ethburger
22,gpp80do,Never said that at all. But it‚Äôs a good indicator that GME isn‚Äôt bearish like the market. And there‚Äôs only one. GME,1,0,1614893021,Solid_Adeptness_5978
23,gpp8aur,"Bro stop pretending like you‚Äôre not trying to be an asshole when you so clearly are. That just makes you a pussy as well. An ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù after a market dip is just childish. My argument was never that GME was bad, just that it isn‚Äôt the ONLY play. Once again you prove you‚Äôre an idiot on top of being an asshole and a pussy",-1,0,1614893148,Ethburger
