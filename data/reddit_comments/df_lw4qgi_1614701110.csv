With the rise of cosmetic dentistry and online invisiline, it finally forced dentists and orthodontists especially, to show some actual critical thinking and listening to patient concerns.  No more simple standard copy and pasting out of the dental book to give everyone the same ""correct"" smile.  

I had braces multiple times and every single ortho kept focusing on having a smile that looked good instead of functional bite.  Took me years, but finally found a dentist that listened and recommended a ortho that did, too.  
Do you research, know what you need, and try to find one that trained in korea (some cosmetic experience).  Good luck.",1,0,1614701144,apoliticalinactivist
