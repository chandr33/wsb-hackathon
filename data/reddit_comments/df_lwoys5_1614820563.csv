1,gpltj2q,"Yeah we've all but given up honestly. Think we're just going to use this time to save more $$ to have more cash to put down, it's either that or rush buy something we don't love in a shitty neighborhood. I'd rather just keep renting honestly, at least we don't have to deal with repairs/maintenance",1,0,1614823177,GottaQuitSometime

13,gpmfv3j,"Awarding you for the brilliant suggestion that anyone who wants to circle jerk about GM3 go to a dedicated sub instead complaining that it is too hard to brigade this sub and gaslight one fucking ticker all day, everday. 

This shit is borderline Heaven's Gate. I'm sure the next big idea will be if it doesn't hit $690 by 4/20 is to collectively $ROPE and will cause your spirits to be broadcast to the starlink constellation where your tendies await.",1,0,1614835390,xcheezeplz

21,gpo6qyf,"Would you chill out? I used customers in the sense that if you start a reddit thread, you obviously want traffic. In that sense, traffic is a contribution in the eyes of the people running it. I'm not saying I or anyone who participates in traffic is from their perspective making a contribution or a sacrifice or a payment or is equivalent to a customer of a store. I thought it was pretty straight-forward what I meant. I meant only in the sense of driving away a large portion of your traffic seems bad not good. 

You seem to only be able to discuss this in terms of including me in every example rather than discussing it as a concept lol. Why the need to make it perosnal?",1,0,1614877364,AdWorried102
