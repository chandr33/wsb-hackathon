Disclosure- I hold neither, sold my RKT today at $40, never owned GME but still holding AMC...
How about a compromise, RKT has NOTHING to do w GME.  the only thing they have in common is that both popped and were good investments.  I am curious though, does holding GME cause self absorbed paranoia?  Just to be helpful, not everything (actually almost nothing) is about GME or GME holders, not everyone is out to fuk GME holders (most of us don't care about them at all).  We honestly wish you the best of luck and all tendies you can take from the market, but none of this is about you or GME.
