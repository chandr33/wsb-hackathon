94,gqdywnm,"Remember the mortgage backed securities crisis in the housing market collapse ? Remember how bad that was? Synthetic CDO’s... CDO of a CDO and so on creating securities out of thin air assuming the underlying (people wouldn’t default on their mortgages) would never collapse ? 

There are parallels on naked shorting and synthetic longs here. Here, the assumption is that the underlying will never go UP so we can leverage our short positions 10 times over. Because we don’t know and it’s not publicly reported, some estimates calculate the short interest on GME to still be HUNDREDS OF PERCENT today, even more than January. I don’t know for sure, you don’t know for sure and it all sounds like conspiracy theory to the common person. 

But you can never rule out human greed. 

Just like how your call option can technically have unlimited profit, the loss on a short position can also be unlimited. 

What happens if people hold GME so hard it goes to $100,000 a share, $1,000,000 a share? 

Melvins prime broker is Goldman. The lending goes all the way up the financial supply chain and banks get loans from the Central bank. 

There is real incentive within the system not to let this run because it can spiral out of control just like the housing crisis after the collapse of one bank (Lehman) virtually overnight and like a virus the loss starts to go spread throughout the financial sector. What if that happens? All the other stocks banks own will have to be dumped just to cap losses and the market will plummet with mutual funds and pension funds invested in the market to lose value or disappear altogether, just like in 2008. 

I am all for GME and literally only have GME and what this stands for but Ive come to recognize why there is so much incentive for market manipulation besides pure greed. Because to the system, that is the lesser of two evils the way they see it. Prevent apes from trading to possibly prevent a collapse of the banking sector. If it does get that bad, the government will bail them out, people will lose their pensions and retirement savings, and It can and will ultimately come back to the every day investor.
