Solid strategy MIGHT BE Deploy 10k at a time, you get to do this 30 times.

If you buy on 10k at a time on solid dips, you grt to catch 30 dips.
Maybe split half on GME and TSLA. Or make your basket 3 eggs. 100k for each pick.

Edit:

If one were to split 300k into 3 eggs and buy 10k slots in each eggs dips, that‚Äôs still 10 dips to buy in each egg. Solid cost average opportunity unless something moons dumb early in the 10 dip cycle buys",1,0,1615311051,Oh_FuFu
