26,gqflq28,"$EPD $15 Million Insider Trade and 20% Undervalued - To the Moon

Bullish on $EPD Enterprise Products Partners - a natural gas and crude oil pipeline company. Massive insider trade of $15 million took place on the 4th of March. This along with a fair value around 20% higher than the current price of around $23.03 means price could go to $28.73. Enjoy them tendies.

Key reasons for optimism include:

Covid vaccines combined with government stimulus should boost the demand for natural gas and oil.

They are buying power from solar projects under a PPA on their way to running 25% on renewables. This is good for a power company because if the price of energy rises - their revenue increases but their cost base (at least the portion powered by solar) stays steady.
