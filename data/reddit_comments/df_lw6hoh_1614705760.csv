25,gpfo95d,"I personally was on the fence about RKT yesterday and decided today I was going to buy it (obviously too late I should have bought some yesterday at close when I made up my mind.

I'm in only 40@29.00 (I also have some stake in GME)

I am a little concerned how much this stock is being ""manipulated"" or ""trending"" with GME. If you look at their charts they are following the exact same trends which is bothering me a bit, and I typically don't like to be a part of anything Cramer talks about as well.

I am going to let it ride until at least the dividend. I realize RKT is an actual real company with a positive business model (vs GME which has some upside but it is very risky) so going long is maybe worth it, but the link to the GME is still worrying me a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

edit

I don't get why there is hate from GME or RKT people either side. They are separate stocks unrelated...if people want one or the other or both why hate....

I'm also in with 500 shares CB 22.15 up 32% since Friday at the time of writing.

I got burned with RKT last year and wheeled my bags for months making modest premiums (premia?), got out at $23 to throw in with GME, now back into this ship because the situation is developing. Literally the only other time I've seen my account go up by 4k in a day before was GME, so not sure why all the hate....seems like the newer 8 million cohort? Fuck it, I love the GME squeeze, funniest shit I've ever seen here, but money is money and this week RKT prints for sure and GME probably is more modest.

Also no more covered calls for now...don't want to miss out on a potential gamma squeeze, although that's not why I bought the shares...think I'll hold these for the time being, might sell half if it goes to $50 this month to lock in gains.

EDIT: So I checked out the user profiles of everyone who used the word ""distraction"" in this thread, and more than half of them were profiles a month old with fuck all karma. These are shills.
