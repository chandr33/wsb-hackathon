Why did it drop to $20 in 2019? 

Every time it hits new highs it really seems to dip right after.
Will have a look at the options tomorrow but good work on the DD.",2,0,1615242997,kmaco75
3,gqbzhrc,"You missed something very important here. Winnebago is not just in RV sales, and way beyond the old school campers most think of.

Where this will go who they heck knows!",1,0,1615301584,SloDrop
