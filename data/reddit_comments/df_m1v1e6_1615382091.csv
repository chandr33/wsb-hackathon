I can't think of a better signal than when NPR's All Things Considered --- a very general interest show that lots of gen Xers and boomers listen to --- had an full-length story on Roblox yesterday evening that was super positive. Talking about the explosive growth so far, plans for massive expansion, even interviewing creators who are going all in on the direct listing. All Things Considered hardly ever covers individual stocks, they usually leave that to Marketplace.
