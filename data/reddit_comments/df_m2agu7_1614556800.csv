12,gqj3ym9,"Spam. This shit is about to take a big dip. Nov 18 to March 10 has double top formation which can lead a big drop. I wouldn't dare buy calls unless it breaks through 28 with significant volume. If it stays under 28 tomorrow, puts might be the best play for march 19th expiry",2,0,1615434638,MarcusAngely

20,gqm6230,"my TenCent stock is doing great wish i had bought more back in the day. 

$IQ im not so sure about, so much piracy in china they probably will just go through the same cycle as here. pirating is the norm, people pay to watch on platforms because of the ease, the market is split between multiple platforms where you need to pay for multiple services (pretty much current situation), people go back to piracy.",1,0,1615495800,worktillyouburk
21,gqnp80h,"Thank you for advertising $IQ on WSB lol.  Ive been holding a very large position in this stock for over two years now and it's been one hell of a mostly unpleasant ride. I'm a regular user of the app and the original content they make are legit (to an Asian user at least). I know people wouldn't dare to invest in this company because ""China Bad"" and I don't blame them. But Iqiyi's recent drama was the first ever chinese drama that ever won a international award so thats pretty innovative right üòÖ. Anyways, I like the shows so I don't feel too bad about my investment.",1,0,1615524202,Hophop1228
