The FED has been buying short term bonds to drive interest rates down, but they haven't taken steps to squash the current speculation (a.k.a printing money, QE, whatever...). So, today, JPow said the market is acting like a retard, so stonks go down and he didn't comment on stopping speculation on bonds, so speculators pushed rates up more.

55,gpp2q8c,"I follow Steve Van Metre pretty religiously and he's shown that past QE and papers from the FED have stated that deflation is the mostly likely path right now. If you have a chance, listen to lectures by Richard Koo, he was working with Japan during their market collapse in the 80's and he has amazing insight into expectations. Overall, the FED's goal is to drive bond interest rates to 0, which will cause stonks to fall. The Eurozone and Japan have been exporting deflation and our companies have not been able to pass on inflated prices of raw goods onto consumers lately, so this is hurting companies right now and consumer prices will fall soon (also deflationary). 

The only way we get inflation is if the banks open their doors and start lending to everyone right now (which they won't, given the current unemployment rates). So all this QE money will stay locked away within the banks and stonk market (unless the GME bubble super pops!) until further notice. This also causes a dollar shortage (see M2 velocity &amp; remember companies not accepting dollars &amp; banks not issuing dollars last year?), which will also lead to a dollar rally and will cause yields to drop (and the stonk market).

TLDR: Deflation is certain until banks ease lending restrictions. The FED has already stated what's going to happen, but people don't listen/understand what they're saying.",128,0,1614890782,Camposaurus_Rex

75,gpp5x04,"Inflation happens when the M2 expands (banks lending) and the money reaches the economy (M2 Velocity shows how easily money is exchanged between hands of business and consumers). I'm not sure I understand what the overturn of money means. However, when people pay down debt, money is destroyed in the process. The data has been showing people are paying down debt, which is likely why the M2 has remained relatively flat for the last few months.

If you have the time, I found this video to be super interesting and enlightening on the banks' role with the money supply. I also have a massive distaste for the central banks now.
