2,gpjc99w,"The 40% number alone isn't the whole story, it gets worse for them...

&gt; a total of about 113.9 million shares -- would be eligible for sale. 
That represents about 35.8% of the total shares outstanding, and could effectively more than double the public float.

4,gpjdlih,"Pick a date for after lockup expiration. They cut driver pay to try to force their paltry $0.09 profit last quarter (435x annually adjusted P/E lol) and now they're offering big bonuses to sign on new drivers. The regulatory environment  is getting more unfriendly and they're certain to lose some of their business as vaccinations rise and vulnerable people can go back to getting their own food. Their insiders know this and are going to dump many of those shares as soon as they're out of lockup. 

I'm looking at the Mar 12 $155 put...just let it bounce back today so I get a reasonable price :)",13,0,1614782741,Solar_Nebula

14,gpjt61l,"My friend who works at Papa John's has the worst stories about app based delivery. Drivers collecting food then cancelling the order in the parking lot just to get a free meal. Drivers demanding that they give them spare sticker seals so that they can ""inspect the order"". Some drivers are trying so hard to min/max the system that when they go to pick up an order, and it's still in the oven because, you know, it's a custom made Papa John's pizza that has to sit in an oven for 6.5 minutes and not a McDonald's hamburger that gets assembled in 20 seconds, they'll just walk out the door and cancel the order because it's taking too long. They just cancel and go pick up an order from Taco Bell instead because they can min/max their earnings that way. So then the app has to locate a completely new driver to come by the store which delays the whole delivery.

App based contractors can be so fucking shitty it'll be amazing if the Doordash brand will survive once restaurants all reopen. Sure, they can downsize, but that'll screw all the drivers even more than they're already getting screwed.",6,0,1614789638,Cryptzoid

20,gplaqbe,"I had the exact same DD and play. Am already up 200% on my puts from Monday. I think it will continue to crater next week. DoorDash is only the market leader because it has been bleeding money like crazy to claim that spot. There is nothing intrinsically better about it than Uber or GH, both of which are strongly positioned to make a comeback. 

Everyone at DD is itching to sell their shares.",3,0,1614813076,Mister_Twiggy

26,gplc2rx,I was an idiot and hesitated to jump in when it was trading $20 higher but those are my thoughts exactly. Why is DD trading at a $55B market cap on $3B of revenue when Grubhub is trading at $6B on $2B of revenue?  I think once the underwriters of the ipo cash out of their shares this is going back under $100 easy,5,0,1614813748,Florida_Knight77
27,gplqv9i,Lol nah. Price dropped too fast today and the stock would have to drop to like $125 to make any money right now. While that might happen I'm going to look for a better entry point tomorrow.
