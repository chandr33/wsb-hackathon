58,gqer07r,"It's possible to make a very bullish PT 100+ (people have made a case), but at growth valuations with higher p/e multiples, or through a ""VC perspective."" And it's not like a departure from fundamentals is unique to GME, in this market, and definitely not in this sub. So it's curious to so often see the same people getting so hung up on ""fundamentals"" who are buying Tesla calls at its ATH or some shitty weedstock because ""Biden.""

But yes I agree - what is happening now has moved way past all that, which mostly just partially justified the upside at 30-40, not entry at 200.

I wouldn't rule out a short squeeze as a piece of the puzzle, though. Your ""demand"" is a balance of forces netting this upwards, prodded by institutions and hedge funds who have positioned themselves to benefit from the upwards movement and volatility, utilizing a diamond-handing base of retail + buying momentum on catalysts, gamma squeeze, short squeeze, MSM, etc. to help prod the thing along. Retail alone couldn't do this, which means the net of forces beyond retail is facilitating the movement.

The losers will be the poorly positioned funds and retail bagholders, as per usual.
