7,gq3rnij,"your right about the math and the possibility of that happening, as far as every call option getting exercised that’s a little off its realistic to assume out of the 1,000,000 shares possible maybe 100,000 or less will get exercised, causing a stock to go up a little but also causing a sell off or mini correction if the stock becomes over bought. as far as extremely over shorted stocks like gme that’s a different story imagine instead 10,000 were talking about around 55,000,000 short positions that took place, you could assume in this case way more people will exercise the calls they bought, but keep in mind there’s a lot of paper hands out there, hope this helps",1,0,1615131312,gooddaysir_
