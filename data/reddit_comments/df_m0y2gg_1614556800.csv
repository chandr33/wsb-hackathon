10,gqajt66,"Okay, I am just a dumb ape, but from the quick perusal I did, I think these are preferred shares that the company can force you out of (but you can not force the company to exchange). They can change out your preferred shares for common shares. It also appears they can change out 1 preferred share for $50.

The reason the preferred shares are trading so much lower than either of those values is because there is no reason for the company to do either of them. Just my guess, so don't take it to seriously.",-1,0,1615262894,wyle_e
11,gqak4s6,"From your PDF:

      Each fixed conversion rate will be adjusted from time to time as follows:

    (i)
        If we issue common shares as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of our common shares, or if we effect a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a reverse share split) of our common shares, each fixed conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula: 

			
  	CR1 = CR0 x (OS1 / OS0)

        where,

            CR0 = the fixed conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date (as defined below) for such dividend or distribution or immediately prior to the open of business on the effective date for such subdivision or combination, as the case may be

            CR1 = the fixed conversion rate in effect immediately after the close of business on such record date or immediately after the open of business on such effective date, as the case may be;

            OS0 = the number of our common shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such record date or immediately prior to the open of business on such effective date, as the case may be (prior to giving effect to such event); and

            OS1 = the number of our common shares that would be issued and outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination.



NBR did a 1 for 50 reverse last year.  Each preferred is worth ~ 0.129 shares of common right now at conversion.

If I read the old table correctly.",2,0,1615263089,ahminus

17,gqaksyh,"You're wrong.  You missed where last year the common stock reverse split 50:1.  So instead of 5.3763, it's now 0.1075.  if the prices don't move you will lose $4/share.

21,gqaonm1,"Please go read the 10Ks, after splits the conversation rate is closer to 0.1144x, the preferred shares are actually currently valued HIGHER than the conversion rate, because there is still some distributions left, trust me, read ten years worth of SEC filings before allocating a large percent of the portfolio to this last April",1,0,1615265957,MitMassUndZiel
