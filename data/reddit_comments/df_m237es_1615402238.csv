56,gqh8vqc,"Ok so here is what I am seeing fellow retards:

The chart is very similar to the last super-pump, with the exception of bigger numbers all around.

Our last pump played out just like this - pumped to around 150 before dumping to around 60, before ultimately going to 350.

In this case, we pumped to 350 (previous ATH - massive sell wall here, makes sense we dump when we hit it) and then dumped to 180.

We are now in a tentative recovery - sitting at 200-300.

HERE IS THE KEY THING TO LOOK AT:

- If we dump back to sub 150, and we don't pump back to 250+ by the end of the week - the pump is most likely over (for a while at least)

- If we sustain current levels of 200-300 for a few days, 400-500 becomes almost a certainty.

- If we just pump right back up to 350 and break it, I'm thinking 500-800 is easily on the table before a MASSIVE dump back to $100.

I think Scenario 1 is most likely, unfortunately.  Scenario 2 also has a good chance of playing out. Scenario 3 is least likely. I don't think we will break 350 again today.",-1,0,1615402250,alexisaacs
57,gqh8vqr,"He didn't sell. An investor would slowly sell. 1,000 sells of 100 shares over a few hours no one would notice and price would stay even and they'd make 350x1,000x100.
