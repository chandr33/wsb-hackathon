Hey guys,

I am an Ape from Mars. I just recently learned how to type on this computer. How can I increase my portfolio while banging my ape missus and her friends by the corner?

Thank you in advance,

10,gphjs9u,With my profits I started a mid size in NIO. Long term or looks good.,0,0,1614736885,DeepBuddy5
11,gphk34o,You are right.... during the same time RKT was booming GME sure did have a lot of sellers on the volume going out. Where did they go... to RKT. No rocket scientist needed to make that correlation. But if you want to say no it's all good. GME holders have diff view points.,-11,0,1614737043,DeepBuddy5

15,gphnnkb,"Ye it was obvious ""Day traders"" going to make a buck ,or 2 . I cant say I blame anyone on easy money. If you dont like to make money on stocks  that is ok to. Day trading is up since COVID, as much more money coming to the markets since last spring , summer, fall  &amp; present. I will be returning to work soon from this Covid mess . I intend to do more day trading with my extra income . Not to say I dont play the long game because I do. I am extremely back new at this. First time investing since 2009 crash. My money sitting around collecting dust, or take a chance on the  wheel of fortune "" As Above, so below.; I am a chance taker my personality dictates that.

17,gphqen2,Please come educate me on my 100k+ plus profit today. Last 5 months 640k. I doubt you could tell me otherwise. Have several seats dumb fuck.
