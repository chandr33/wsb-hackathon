That was my youth, and I got sucked in just as hard as ever. 24 hours in the first 4 days, because it's a straight nostalgia trip and it's fun seeing everything and being like, Oh yeah, I remember the ghost amulet, or whatever.

33,gqay09i,"&gt;  we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games 

  
Idk about that, I'd say WoW was an essential part of ~~learning to use others to achieve my own goals~~ developing my social skills.

Also, learning to ~~call people retarded~~ type quickly while defending flags.

Smelting bars in Ironforge essentially passed GCSE Chemistry for me.

(Soon to be gold bars ey  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ )

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, the most important lesson I learned, was ~~never to fuck with more than one of those damn Un'goro Thunderers at a time~~  ape strong together.  ü¶çü¶çü¶ç",1,0,1615273139,Jaxxftw
