13,gqff6sy,"As a corn and soybean farmer I'm laughing at you

Prices are currently at their peak and Soy will definitely drop sharply after april when the spring planting reports come out with 5x the number of soy acres planted than last year

16,gqfh28a,"Last year iowa was hit with a major wind storm that knocked down a lot of corn so to control volunteer corn (old corn regrowth) they will plant those fields into soybeans to manage it

If you don't know anything about agriculture you're playing a risky game with commodities

Currently soybeans are trading $14.30/bu and I expect by the end of may we will see new crop futures below $10",1,0,1615368697,NMS_Survival_Guru

19,gqfjyj5,"More spending on food and goods, going back to work at the office means people have less food to spend on stonks. 

Food prices surging too high is dangerous for the ruling class and it is within their interest to suppress it in any way possible. They don't want revolt and food insecurity is the quickest way for that to happen. 

Food staples futures have been manipulated by the US for decades now...they want to keep food cheap.",1,0,1615371524,quaeratioest

26,gqirqv2,"Amazing! I did my undergrad and MS in ag at Ohio State in soybean research, but LOL, yeh I really know nothing about actual farming. 

I would love to talk to you more! 

So like how much room to grow does the US have. I figured every acre that could be planted in soy/corn had been. Could farmers really 2-5x their planting if need be?

If soy goes up and farmers switch won't that just put upward pressure on corn? 

I would still say a bet split between soy/corn/wheat over the next year can't miss. Why is that wrong?",2,0,1615427985,AndyWarholWasAwful
