62,gqfsvnl,"Thank you!

The following is comments i posted on other god tier DD yesterday and I was highly encouraged to post my thoughts in a discussion post so figured I would hijack here .. feel free to critique and again I *want* to be optimistically wrong ! Cheers!

Sorry if out of context just copy/paste.

---------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

I am likely a novice compared to someone that calls themself a technical trader, but I know math, and I can absorb DD and info at super ape rates. It makes sense to me that the dramatic lower volume compared to Jans run up is contributed to the ability, or lack of ability, of the shorts. The past few days movement has appeared as organic stock growth reacting to current news and events. It just wasn't super suppressed by absurd shorting and wasn't heavily influenced by a gamma squeeze. Calm volume, organic growth. It appears as if GME is currently in a vacuum of being able to be itself, without dramatic artifical movement forces. 

One could theorize from that, that - 

*public sentiment and awareness is high (by previous comparison) 

*diamonds hands forge on 

*The screwed HFs are observing the situation and planning their next course. Going full retard themselves didn't work as it usually has. Going even fuller retard could just prove to be foolish and result in a worse outcome for them. Perhaps they've been warned. Perhaps MMs reaction to the new DTCC rule (that hasn't been enacted yet) is to prepare ahead of time for it, so as to not let HFs continue to dig their hole.


Tl;dr IMO GeeMEee currently experiencing pure organic growth. Stock not influenced either up or down. ALL technicals point to bullish and 🚀🚀🚀. Gamma squeeze will still occur but hasn't for this week yet. Short squeeze can occur at any point during the party. DTCC rule once in affect will force the short squeeze and prevent future ones. 

--------------------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@


Second comment .... 

Thank you! If you're interested in other thoughts floating my ape brain .. 

I think that , as is in other DD, we are in the Jan squeeze comparable rise. With that info, a couple things to consider... 

*1 Jan's squeeze was artificially held down AND THEN our precious BUY button was removed. A comment aired on TV from hedgie that it would have gotten into the thousands. Thousands, in Jan. 

*2 No illegal manipulation this time (right?) 

*3 VW short squeeze looking very identical to our current situation, obligatory ""you are here"". Given that VW biggest spike went 3X over its cat ear spikes .. we could theorize 3X our cat ears. 

*4 But our cat ears were manipulated and buy button removed. 

*5 1+2+3+4 = ... [(""thousands"" x3) + new developments. Company actually worth a much higher theoretical value now compared to before. + new DTCC rule (MMs prepping)] 

Oh boy. Oh let's not forget about the potential gamma and short squeezes! Hell. 

Bold prediction that I actually WANT to be wrong: $1K-$5K THIS WEEK. NOT FROM SHORT SQUEEZE. 

Why do I want it to be wrong? Further movement will occur from actual short squeeze, likely NEXT WEEK. $1K-$5K this week will test the hardest of diamond hands, especially if they make it to the weekend. Especially if Monday goes red. Oye. Will the rocket fail? Hell no. Will most of people miss it, thinking its the top when its not? I fully believe so. 

Time will tell and shit I'm in part typing this out loud so the universe will laugh and ill be wrong. I want to be wrong as fuck. Hell, I want to see a decrease tomorrow. I don't want diamond hands to be tested so severely this week when it might truly pop next week. People will see the moon and forget we're going to Andromeda. At this point the biggest win a losing HF can get is to shake off as many poors as they can from the rocket just for laughs.. We'll see I suppose. Under $600 this week would give me a very stress free weekend.",1,0,1615379206,anon_78
