0,gqhcx1y,I did zero DD on this shit but all I know is parents pay their kids in robux or whatever the shit is called to just stfu. That to me seems priceless. Very bullish on this.,1,0,1615403915,Gynecologyst420

2,gqhw9yq,"As a former Robloxian, I can say with confidence that good games were a dime a dozen the last time I played, and even then most of those weren't even among the highest-rated. If I had to guess, it's probably more about a dip in the quality of the games on the front page which isn't necessarily representative of the whole site.",1,0,1615412196,SerialMurderer

5,gqhx9a5,"Maybe you're right, but everyone seems to be looking for validation and a confirmation bias. I'm still gonna trust my sons opinion. If I miss out that's fine, but someone's gonna be holding a bag on this one and it won't be me. Y'all do what you want and I hope it works out but I can't lose if I don't play.

9,gqi4v4m,I just feel like the real way to make money is selling calls to WSB retards and if you didn’t pick up 100 shares just to do that you’re losing out.,1,0,1615416133,Uncle_Samoyed
10,gqi5cyb,"Oh sorry, I wasn't trying to say it'd open at 10. Just that was my son's suggested limit and I agreed not to buy it unless it went at or below that.",1,0,1615416373,botulinum95
11,gqial1b,"I am not sure. Deferring revenue seems like cheating to me. They literally have those money in their bank account.

I would be happy to defer my income too, my tax deductions will look a lot nicer. And then with the saved tax dollar I have I might make more income that gets deferred!",1,0,1615418959,SiegeLion

13,gqiwr5b,"I mean if the employees want to, they can do it whenever. It’s not a set day. Personally, I would give it a week before buying. It should settle down by then. 

Not financial advice",2,0,1615430613,RoadToTeslaModel3
14,gqix89c,"Well because they know the valuation is bullshit, but they gambled on this bubble market to inflate their price even more and won.  I'd be very surprised if it survives for more than a few weeks without a significant dump, but hey, that's the market sometimes you time things right, sometimes you don't",0,0,1615430864,Rossoneri
