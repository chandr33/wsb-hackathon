2,gqgppyi,"TD doesn’t like having to document ‘nonsense’ sell limits. What they do instead is allow you to make ‘conditional’ orders. Where you say ‘if the price reaches this, place an order for this’. That being said, a lot of people put up high sell orders for the purpose of preventing their shares from being borrowed, I’m not actually sure if TD lets people borrow your shares or not on a cash account.",1,0,1615395123,TheGangstaGandalf
