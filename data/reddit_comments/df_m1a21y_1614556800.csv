56,gqcjb4g,"Anything that you're thinking of as an investment has some amount of risk to it; usually the larger the return the larger the inherent risk. Something that will return 5% will generally have a lower risk than something that will return 10%, which would have a lower risk than something that will return 20%. If you are looking for something that would enable you to leave your day job, you are looking for something that has low risk, and so would almost certainly have a low return. So the answer to your question is that there is nothing that you could invest in that would be guaranteed to let you leave your day job on any type of short timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next best question is, is there something that you could do with the money that would give you what looks like a guaranteed return, improve your long-term financial situation, and speed the point at which you could leave your day job? Most likely, there is. Although it's not sexy, let me ask you this: do you currently rent or pay a mortgage for where you live? Could you use your windfall to pay off your mortgage or buy a place to live, getting rid of your monthly housing payment? If you're paying $1,000 per month (which I admit is probably near the upper limit for $45,000 annual income) for housing, then getting rid of that payment is like getting a guaranteed 6% \*tax-free\* return on the $200k. That's almost the same as making a 10% short-term return, but with zero risk, which is impossible in securities investment.

&amp;#x200B;

By getting fully-owned housing, you lower your monthly bills, which reduces the amount that you would need saved to leave your day job. Since you wouldn't be reducing your income at this point, you would also be freeing up money to save in your IRA, 401(k) or a non- tax-advantaged savings, meaning you could get to that lower amount you would need to have saved more quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

So although this is Wall Street Bets, I would suggest that your best way to invest your windfall would be in real estate, namely securing paid-off housing.",1,0,1615309170,SirTristam

76,gqcohxg,"I will paste a comment I made on a very similar thread: 

1.	‚Å†Take out rainy day money. If you have a mortgage and shit, I recommend 7-10k.
2.	‚Å†Max out your roth IRA for the year. If you don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre doing, just put all that money into FDKLX. Hell, max out last year‚Äôs too, I think you can until April:
3.	‚Å†Gamble with 15-30% of your taxable account and spread the rest healthily between 65% IVV, 10% State municipal bonds (yields are untaxed), and 25% VXUS.

Every 10k you have will be worth about 100k when you‚Äôre 60 if you just put it in safe stocks and don‚Äôt touch it. You‚Äôre welcome.

Also get the fuck off WSB, this place is for degenerate gambling; you will lose money if you‚Äôre coming from a place of desperation or FOMO. If you‚Äôre really willing to go through all the pain and loss it takes to become a good trader, do everything I said besides step 3, YOLO all that money on a series of different trades. Over time, you‚Äôll learn. It‚Äôs the only way. The choice is yours, Neo.

And don‚Äôt use robinhood, for fuck sake man.

Edit: Additionally, if you don‚Äôt have a mortgage and shit put some extra money into cash and bonds so you can save up for a house. The average person will waste nearly 200k on rent in their lifetime- would you rather make a risky stock bet to get 200k, or just buy a house and basically get the benefit of 200k risk and tax free?",1,0,1615311428,misterYOLOdolo
