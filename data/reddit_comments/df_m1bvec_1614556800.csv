17,gqcy1dg,"I enjoy the unbridled enthusiasm for the 100k meme, and of course I love to go into my phone calculator to see how much money I'd make if it actually went that high, but I don't see how it's realistically possible to get to that level. Regardless, I've made several thousand off GME and I continue to hold. Ape strong.",2,0,1615315819,Janoys_last_huehue
18,gqcyeax,"Yeah I’m all for buying and holding, but if you think 90% of people aren’t selling if it hits 1000 let alone 500 you’re high.",0,0,1615315985,rowdydog42
19,gqdu7mf,10k a share.......Oh yeah 700 billion dollar market cap is totally not wishful thinking. Y’all are nuts. Lower your expectations or your going to hold the bag.,1,0,1615330365,sus-bus-fetus
20,gqdulk8,I didn't say it wasn't wishful thinking but it'd be nice. I didn't put any money in that I couldn't afford to lose so if I am left holding the bag then whatever. No guts no glory.,1,0,1615330550,Critical_Werewolf
21,gqduz1f,Dude. For the love of god don’t hold this shit to 0. Ride as high as you want but at a certain point  put a stop loss to at least walk away with some profit. Narratives are stupid. Money talks. We’re here to make money not stick it to a bunch of boomers in suits. Boomers in suits getting slaughtered like the pigs they are is a side effect from other boomers in suits doing the slaughtering. Retail is just along for the ride.,2,0,1615330732,sus-bus-fetus

26,gqfiekq,"Sure 90% can sell at 500-1000$, but 90% of shares is not enough to cover all shorts. So if gme will be squuozed, it will easily break through 1k",1,0,1615370001,Nelvalhil
