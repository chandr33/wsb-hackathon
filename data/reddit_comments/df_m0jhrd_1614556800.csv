19,gq8iql7,"Not opinion but inevitably. Most will be at work and will go out to get lunch their self if not brought from home. They are less likely to spend what they worked for especially when just now starting back. Dash food options are limited and states allowing restaurants to open back. People will save their money to do extra activities such as movies, fairs, traveling, malls ect this summer. To retain costumer they‚Äôll probably offer a shyt ton of discounts which ideally occurs in lost revenue. A Lot less folks will be getting stimmy along with PUA. Back to the dash having limited options, as a user of the app (this just a human thing) eating the same thing every other week makes you want it less especially when everything you buy is automatically in the $15 range by policy. Door dash should go to shyt like Uber eats after expiry. It‚Äôs current holders know to sell off asap if they are smart and the inexperienced retail will get scared and sell aswell. These the factors outside of why it‚Äôs really overvalued but the fact you can‚Äôt find a single person that‚Äôs bullish on this stock should be the main indicator",2,0,1615226957,Cynical_vibe

24,gq8k4tx,"No way, there maybe traders who actually think $140 is a good deal holding it at that price today but the IPO was structured as a pump and dump. They went public soon as the vaccine was announced, shares issued to insiders at a tiny fraction of the 100+ dollar IPO.

The shares available on the entire market are being doubled tomorrow, and these guys want to make one last dollar before their failing business model goes to dust. Nobody really likes the company. Customers hate em, restaurants hate em, delivery drivers are meh, have no loyalty and would jump to a better opportunity in a heartbeat. Digging into Glassdoor if you can wade through all the delivery driver reviews you'll see the guys in corporate (who will own the shares) hate it there. Even the owner doesn't believe it's future, and admits the peak is behind them. Various articles online calls the IPO a joke, I couldn't find one example that has a bullish sentiment.

It might not happen overnight, anything can happen short term but this stock is going down. It's hard to find a comparable company in history that was so set up for failure, I look at GPRO but even they have an excellent product and tons of loyalty, just grossly over valued IPO. It's only my theory but I think these guys have little intention of having a thriving company in two years, based on how outrageous this play is.",2,0,1615227551,G-Gnomes
