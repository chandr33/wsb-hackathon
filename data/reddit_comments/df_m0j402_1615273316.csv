0,gqayfkx,Housing market is insane...hedgies are delusional if they think a few tenths of a percentage point increase in mortgage rates are cooling this insane market.  Houses are disappearing off the market in a few days and will into the foreseeable future.,1,0,1615273512,AllNamesTaken10987

17,gqdeush,"Update: As of now, 200k shares available, borrow cost 9.76% per IBKR.

This is still high, but down from 17% yesterday.  Most likely some shorts covered today.

I just got around to filling out and sending in my fully paid lending documentation with Fidelity.  They pay 60% of the lending fee when they borrow your shares.  If the shorts don't give up this could be better than the dividend.

I know that people think that you should avoid having your shares lending, but remember... if they can't short, there can't be a squeeze.  Plus I am getting paid for holding a stock I would hold anyway -- literally free money.  I'm hoping to see these getting lent out tomorrow.",2,0,1615323374,Keith_13

23,gqenfid,"Sure. Two days ago, it was almost $11.

The entire market got crushed last week - and this is already bouncing back. I’m looking at my option today and it is up 30.3% on the day. Think about that, if you put $1,000 in yesterday, you made $300 today.

I got in high and I think it’s going up again. There is TONS of money to be made here at this price.

Today, I sold off everything other than AMC and GME and am trying to decide whether to buy more UWMC calls, stock or what to do.

Edit: typos and I accidentally said this week instead of last week. Also added some details on my option - which is down overall and up 30.3% on the day.",1,0,1615345834,balpon37
24,gqens0z,Monday of _this_ week? The chart doesn't show UWMC approaching $11. It had a low of $8.10 and a high of $8.77 yesterday.,2,0,1615346032,dgodfrey95
25,gqeo8y0,"Yes you are right! Must’ve posted that while I was editing - I need to proofread myself before posting rather than after 😂

I added a few more details and also corrected that it was *last* week that it was approaching $11 and not yesterday.",2,0,1615346299,balpon37

I just know the higher the strike price, the riskier it is, but the higher the reward if the stock explodes. Please anyone, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm a retard.",1,0,1615446485,AcidRivix
