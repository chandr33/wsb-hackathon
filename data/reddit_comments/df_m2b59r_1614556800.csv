Now we are steadily around 200 and it would be safe to assume that it could easily get to 750 dollars and trigger another gamma squeeze to 2k. The assumption is that this would be the perfect launchpad for a short sqeeze pushing it to 69k? Why wouldnt they start covering at 700 or even less knowing that its going to be mich higher later?

62,gqijr9c,"It really is a psychological game, they are really trying to make us think that it‚Äôs a bad thing to buy this stock, regardless of what they‚Äôve done.

I personally bought GME back in November because I believed the stock price would go up due to the PS5 launch so I bought it for $11 and when I saw that there was not enough stock for PS5 sales at the time, it made me sell for about a 10% gain at $12. Only recently I bought back in at $209 when I saw news about an e-commerce expansion, I genuinely see it as an attractive investment regardless of the short squeeze, so what wrong with that? They make it seem like it‚Äôs manipulation when loads of people buy a stock, which is absolute bs. But shorting a stock over 100% to artificially lower a price to try and bankrupt a company isn‚Äôt manipulation at all? It‚Äôs more than just manipulation actually, and when you realise the true nature of what they have done it makes you really want the short squeeze to happen for the good of the market &amp; companies. It just makes it more of an attractive investment

Edit: I agree, I think they will try and artificially fake small squeezes to shake out paper hands, but we all know the heights this can go to. A $100 drop when the price is at $10000 per share is only a 1% decrease, it only seems like a big drop now since the price is only $260",18,0,1615423816,Jasbeats

Great DD.

Few questions for curious apes:

1. it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420: did you get these numbers by backtracking from 69420? how did you get $772 and $2314?
2. The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher &amp; close to happening.  
pls explain significance of retarded doji- or even explain retarded doji to retarded ape.
3. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try &amp; trigger a sell-off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180 :  
I suspect hedgies have more tricks up their sleeves- but certainly, they have not met HODLERS and do not know what to do- becoming very apparent.
4. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.** : what is making it rise up so quick- before it took a lot longer- is it the high IV?
5. Can you throw some numbers on the 1st chart- because I reviewed your predictions and they are very accurate. Care to throw some more predictions so far as the where and when you predict the next dip. I had to get a new set of pants when it dipped today but i   
üì∑ and sure enough all the DD of everyone in here paid off.

91,gqiqijw,"1. I first calculated the rise in January being a 3000% increase from $15 to $450. Knowing that it was possible for the stock to rise this much just from a gamma squeeze, I could then concur that a starting point for the stock to rise 3000% to $69420 is $2314, but the percentage increase could be a lot higher since the january squeeze was manipulated from restricting buying, therefore stopping the true squeeze potential.

2. A doji is simply a type of candlestick that signifies indecision from the intraday price action. In this case that doesn't really matter because what created that doji was an artificial short attack. What matters is that the stock had a significant dip but bounced straight back up, meaning that the stock has huge strength and doesn't want to collapse at all, it makes me very confident that hedge funds are not going to be able to drive the price to where they want no matter how hard they try.

3. Indeed

4. IV is what makes the stock possible to go up to $69420, because the higher the price, the more bigger increases the stock can make relative to percentage increase. If the short squeeze starts happening now and goes up 300% everyday, it will take 5 days to reach $69420. But if it goes up to $69420 in 1 day that would be a 26700% which would technically be impossible due to not enough implied volatility, so in conclusion just be patient and expect the squeeze to last at least a week long.

5. It's not very wise to throw specific numbers because that just can't be predicted, I rather just give rough numbers based on how i personally view things, it's just my own point of view and the first prediction just so happened to come out perfectly from luck. I knew it would push up due to the 5 green candles in a row &amp; the pattern on the chart, it was just a rough prediction that happened to turn out right.
