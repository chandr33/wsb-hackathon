Jokes aside, first of all you should find a broker that offers proper service (not robinhood). Afterwards, you should ask yourself how much you are willing to lose. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Assess your risk tolerance. Are you more on the defensive side? Or do you like it aggresive? High risk comes with high reward. 0.5% a day is a compounded 11.60% monthly return. I doubt that most retailers earn that much unless they are very speculative, but then you are exposed to downside risk as well.

Once you established your risk tolerance, it's time to do due research: start off broad, do you want to invest in individual stocks, start searching for industries first that sparks your own interest and then zoom in. Once you found a bunch companies, you start screening them by looking at their financials, product line, philosophy, board directors and executives.. or just look here for DD (due diligence).

Good luck, my fellow brother.",1,0,1615283188,QuantopiaNL
