0,gpm6po3,"I'm a huge fan of palantir but I think you made a mistake in your title...it is a great company, but it is not ""undervalued"" it is trading at 40x price/sales. It made $1b in income in 2020 and spent almost $2b in SG&amp;A. With bond yields rising, the relative attraction of something that will take that long to reach a good multiple is decreasing

TLDR: being a good company (I think 300b in 10 years) does not mean it is undervalued especially as market dynamics change",1,0,1614829873,brocococococo

73,gpme8si,"AI is a toaster.  A better AI is a microwave with a popcorn setting and some sensor.  I have forever been amused by the entire concept of AI taking over the world. Even machine learning and self modifying AI is entirely bound within the scope of it's basic programming which merely says ""look for this value"" and ""here's the 'worth' of that value.""  Yes, the programming can get more complex, but even a car is merely a set of many basic parts.  A car only functions as whole based on the design allowances of all those parts.  AIs can't do anything beyond this.  Even if an AI was given boundless flexibility, it's generally random chaos that goes nowhere.  You still have to tell it what has value, what's good, what the reward is, and how valuable it is.  And even then, it only acts based on those parameters and no more.  The core problem is a toaster can't become a fighter jet, for so very many reasons, regardless of the complexity of the AI system.  It was doomed from the beginning to just make toast.  With all the power in the universe, it could ever only make toast better.  That's the intrinsic stupidity of AI.

One might argue that we humans are no different from complex AI, the same way an ant is no different from a complex AI, or an amoeba is no different from a complex AI.  We're all just different machines.  And for the most part, that's correct.  But there is already HUGE systems investment in place, functional partnerships of subsystems, and we spend decades teaching our dumb AI minds just to be remotely competent at existing without failing (death) if we're left alone for more than 2 seconds.  Even so, we can't become fighter jets either.  We're still constrained by our construction.  Even the complexity of our modern world was built upon centuries of collective effort (and many failures, aka wars/death of entire species lineages) and also dumb luck along the way.  Even all our success too millions of years, monumental collective effort, and even now, we fail and die all the time.  So even the best AI ever would still take monumental efforts, both mental and physical, to make any appreciable dent in our world space, let alone take over said world.

But...it'd be fun to watch it try.  At least we have nations building actual fighting robots for sport, so we have that going.",24,0,1614834340,mvw2

78,gpmexzc,"I'd have to say I agree. Lock-up was and is the reason for the drop in price. There has been a cascade effect on sentiment; large investors and small both concerned the bottom will drop back out which is why we keep hitting resistance. However, I believe forward momentum is inevitable. Once the ball gets rolling (particularly past $30) I think $45-$50 is a realistic EOY goal. An optimistic outlook would put it closer to $60.

I bought in at $24.76, PLTR is now 15% of my portfolio (I think entry price and portfolio share are better gauges than shares/position value as this can be relative to the investor and their buying power.
