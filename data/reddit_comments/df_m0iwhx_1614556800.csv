6,gq8e41d,"Oshkosh, who got the contract instead, is being investigated due to a surge in stock purchases prior to the announcement. Not sure how that factors in.

I jumped the Workhorse ship at a 10% loss. As long as DeJoy is in charge of USPS, I dont see Workhorse getting the contract.",1,0,1615225062,AvengingCoyote

9,gq8kxo1,There was 100% some really unusual options activities around the time of the contract announcement which came almost a month earlier than the companies were anticipating. The amount of strike 25 puts on workhorse was comical compared to the other weeks. I don't know how the company would have insight to that through its a federal government contract so doesn't everyone find out the result at the same time.,2,0,1615227893,brainal46
10,gq8n6hf,"Giving the contract to Oshkosh in general was odd. They dont have the EV experience Workhorse has, nor do they have a prototype that has been tested thorougly, like Workhorse has. 

This might be my bias showing, but I think DeJoy pushed for Oshkosh because, as his party usually does, he completely disregarded the whole ""Go Green"" movement. I would be willing to bet he knows someone at Oshkosh",3,0,1615228844,AvengingCoyote

14,gq99cw7,Oshkosh supplies the military with a majority of their tactical vehicles. I still use explorer to access some government websites. Uncle Sam doesn’t diversify. I could have told you Oshkosh would get it,2,0,1615238452,ryan_james504
15,gq9af3f,"I knew they dealt with military, but I didnt know to what extent. I also figured since this was for a 'civilian' service, it would be handled differently. Looking back now, its obvious that wouldnt be the case. My only initial concern with Workhorse was their small size.

I jumped on Oshkosh for a bit after selling Workhorse, but sold again this morning after reading about the suspicious trade activity. Theres likely money to be made there, but I'm not touching it.",1,0,1615238921,AvengingCoyote
