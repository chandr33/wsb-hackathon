4,gqej3ju,I totally tried to switch to Fidelity and they were going to take up to 14 days before I could spend! Wth?! I donâ€™t know how any of you had the patience to deal with those grandpaâ€™s. They seriously need to get with the times. I waited 3 hours to talk to someone then they tell me I have to link my checking ( 7 days) then I have to deposit money via check... and wait for it to clear ...( 7 days)... and repeat anytime I want to purchase. Great system. I laughed at him and hung up.,2,0,1615343453,b4ttlepoops
