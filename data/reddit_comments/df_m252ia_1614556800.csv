6,gqh8hgg,"you dont sell one for the other, you simply just buy more and hold till the time is right. Flip flop back and forth enough and you'll end up losing money. The charts speak more on that. That being said, do what you feel is the right move for you but dont get sad when the things start going upward and you've positioned yourself in a tough spot. 

I've done it so i know what its like only to be able to just watch people making money instead of being apart of it.",1,0,1615402093,fumez23
