86,gpkjxuc,"A lot of discussions about positioning Rocket more as a tech-driven company (vs a traditional lender).  They continue to gain market share and their retention rates are significantly higher than the industry.

Fundamentals seem strong, but the space has low multiples (vs the market).

What people don't realize is that they gained market share in periods of declining mortgage/loan originations, so a rising interest rate environment is bad for the industry, but significantly less for RKT.
