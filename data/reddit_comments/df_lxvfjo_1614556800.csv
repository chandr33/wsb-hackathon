1,gpp71vs,Be careful.   AMC showed something like this the other day and it never showed up.  It was for (4) 4 million shares.,21,0,1614892604,oooTROUBLEooo
2,gpp7vyt,Deep ITM calls are definitely big institutions tossing in a few million. Noticed all the volume in strikes ranging from $12-20 for 4/16 expiry and hopped in on some calls. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll go up but it‚Äôs a good sign when over $30MM in premium trades in the last 30 minutes of the day.,96,0,1614892968,TheBushmonger

8,gppdwfi,"Idk but I'm pretty sure if GME execs want they can start really messing with the shorts. Something like if they pay dividends then the ones who short have to pay them.

I think it's something like that.",90,0,1614895623,Neighbor_

18,gppjtj1,"It‚Äôs part of SEC 204: essentially, a forced buy-in occurs in a short seller's account when the original lender of the shares recalls them. This can also occur when the broker is no longer able to borrow shares for the shorted position. In some cases, an account holder might not be notified before a forced buy-in.",96,0,1614898386,MaBonneVie
