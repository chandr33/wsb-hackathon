40,gqhaw6j,Lol there was nothing ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù about the huge short volume during lunch. There is clearly a huge amount of gamma exposure above 300 and even more at 350 combined with the short interest at those price levels as well. Power hour is when most people are away from the computers at lunch so it would be the best time to make whatever moves would cause the most panic. They have algos running this stuff and model the best times to perform these actions. Clearly mid day is when they think most people wont be paying attention ans when they come back to see gme drop almost 100 dollars after breaking past 300 would hopefully incite panic. This is the game.,19,0,1615403073,Vi0lentByt3
