17,gqietjb,"&gt;	fell like a falling knife within minutes.

I like this analogy. Let me elaborate as someone who manages a kitchen:

Every employee of mine is taught the phrase ‚Äúa falling knife has no handle.‚Äù Some of you might‚Äôve heard it. Some of you maybe not. Basically it‚Äôs engrained in kitchen workers to not try and catch a knife if you knock it off a table. Just let it fall and pick it up. 

To apply that here, when the price is falling, let the fucker fall and when it bottoms out, buy more. 

This is not financial advice.
This is kitchen advice.

Now, if it was the case, I also don't assume they're all Redditors. I learned the value of holding through you guys, because I'm now understanding its squeeze potential. When I first invested, I didn't really know anything about it. I thought people all rallied to purchase, and at some point when they all sold that would be it, so any sudden drop I wanted to sell. Now I'm getting what's happening, I've made sense of things like averaging down, and I'm retardedly believing in numbers like 100k and just hoping for the best there.",5,0,1615430381,Blzer_OS
56,gqiwk25,"Thats the strategy.

Trigger a massive sell off. Shit its probably just a couple funds trading between themselves at lower and lower rates. This can only go so far and they bank on catching stop limits and margin calls on the way down. Bots and day traders get knocked out as well. You try to cause people to emotionally panic sell. You light the firecracker and hope for a stampede. It's all manufactured.

Seeing the rapid bounce back just indicates how many people didn't paperhand and how institutions and individuals see the dip as a buy opportunity.

Stop losses are great and smart and reasonable for most stocks but NOT in GME. You buy and hold and be patient. AND DON'T HOLD ON MARGIN  The thesis has not changed.",5,0,1615430511,glide_si
