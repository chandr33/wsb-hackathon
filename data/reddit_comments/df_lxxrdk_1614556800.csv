9,gpplyv6,"GME can hedge the downturn as it‚Äôs out of the situation or nonexistent to the fundamentals at moment. The upward pressure isn‚Äôt driven by the market, but the short covering. The short placed a lot of puts already on their holdings.  I bought some puts too on some GME related stocks, eg banks",1,0,1614899425,External-Chemical-40

21,gppw4vb,"For the sake of your thesis, you may want to associate the deadcat bounce with the influx of stimulus checks. 

Retail will be pouring those funds into the market like syrup on pancakes, for better or worse. And if your theory stands on its own two feet, the smart money would eat up those stimmys as profit, thus, triggering the double top, as you proposed. 

In any case, I have long calls getting ass taxed like Santa's helpers on Christmas Eve, so I personally hope your theory goes tits up. 

My opinion aside, I value logic and reason, and your thesis can be reasonably supported by these qualities, so, touche. 

Best of luck, but fuuuuck youuuu gay bear.",3,0,1614904569,BigBrainBets
