0,gpm9nlp,"OP I like this theory, itâ€™s been in the back of my head for a while but wifeâ€™s bf has my balls snipped atm, might be time to audio/book the art of war by sun tzu for the young autists in training, if you can get above $25k itâ€™s a good goal to set, other brokerages may have higher limits.  

Theyâ€™re scanning sentiment which has been reported, to what degree I donâ€™t know

14,gpmderw,I donâ€™t agree that rkt is a P&amp;D. Itâ€™s more like a mini squeeze somewhat failed to sustained. Not everything is a HF conspiracy distracting you from GME.,6,0,1614833805,zerryw

17,gpmdpcr,Obviously I didnâ€™t pay for the service but having those two names tied directly to that stock should at least give you pause. Do you boo but just know GameStop screwed them over bad and to think they arenâ€™t doing something about it directly here in this forum is way more retarded than expected. I played RKT knowing this full well and it proved true.,1,0,1614833996,caucasian_asian03

32,gpn2xtl,"Bro this thing tanked becsuse you all brigaded the megathread !??? It's actually insane how you guys spent all day shitting on RKT and then say it's a PND.

All stocks dropped at open, only difference between RKT mega thread and GME thread was the fact that all the RKT people weren't in the GME thread telling people 'gme is a scam, it's a PND, invest in insert stock, its a distraction'.

Rkt was a great play but it was ruined by the people that spent all day in the megathread from the moment it was created shitting all over it and changing the sentiment. You can literally see it happen in real time just go and look.

It's now mad to see someone create a post and try to re-enforce this it was a PND agenda when in reality 18k comments Inna megathread saying it's over and it's a pnd caused this to tank and loss all momentum. None of you will admit it or eve acknowledge it but you guys killed this sub..ain't no going to buy into anything when they know 8.4 million idiots who joined Reddit a month ago now dictate what stocks can be spoken about in WSB.",1,0,1614855614,20Log
