35,gqk6bf7,"While thats normally true, ownership of GME shares is well over 100% by institutions alone, probably another 100% by retail by now. The stock has been manipulated for months now and not reflecting its true value. Eventually though and when the DTCC pops their new rule.. the piper will get paid and tendies arrive! And then in the future hopefully stocks will reflect closer to true value.",1,0,1615460146,anon_78

Our government would rather give us all mutated fish fish aids delivered by mass very expensive assassin drone program to just bump us off or push us all onto disability benefits so they could claim we were lying about being almost dead and push us onto mandatory work programs with sweaty unemployed 18year old parents of 8 and give us a few scraps a week claiming that we're all benefit cheats and living the high life buying 'big screen TVs' and what not to justify reducing those scraps some more then sitting back and pointing and laughing.

I mean, most of the people responsible for making those decisions are actually involved in hedge funds but y'know

*This is definitely not meant to be taken seriously haha, just sitting around eating crayons and procrastinating until the market opens so I can buy me some more delicious stock...hopefully there's a nice dip I can buy more stock in as I missed the chance yesterday and I feel like I gotta make it up to y'all

41,gqk8n8p,"9.5 million people with $1400 each that's $13.3 Billion that could go to stonks.
