9,gppaebi,"&gt;The dividend pays out $1.11 per share to every holder of the stock on March 9th. If a 2.2 million share buy set the share put the price up, imagine when retail (and more institutions) buy in ahead of March 9th. 


The SP is going to go down when it's paid out. Who's to know what happens after but if you're bullish wouldn't it make more sense to buy after since it would be at a ""discount""?",1,0,1614894067,Butthole--pleasures

15,gpped0w,"The record date is the 9th. So the sell off would happen on the 10th. 

But to get the divi,  shares have to be purchased no latter than tomorrow. So could see a bump tomorrow and drop Wednesday.",17,0,1614895826,landof8

19,gppeyw2,"Yeah, all that means is once it gets past $40, it will rocket up from there.

And keep in mind, they fought REALLY hard to keep it below $40... Meaning that was likely a red line for them. Probably still it.",21,0,1614896100,Megahuts

22,gppfk19,"Theoretical, yes.

Practical? Well, it ran from $20 to $45 in the past 5 days.

So does a $1.11 special dividend matter that much compared to that?",9,0,1614896370,Megahuts

25,gppi2uz,"By what I can find this would also mean the shorts would need to buy to cover tomorrow in order to have those settled by Tuesday or be stuck paying the divi themselves.

So if they have say 40 million shares shorted that's 45 million they need to come up with.",8,0,1614897557,landof8
26,gppigb4,Not to mention the short Days to cover decreases with average volume if you spread the 5 day avg volume In conjunction with current short % in relation to float its SQUEEZE TERRITORY. In the face of a dividend or volume,9,0,1614897735,needlamon

32,gppko6p,"Can we stop talking about short volume? Some shorts close their position the same day. That‚Äôs why I look at Ortex data to look at Short Interest and SI % of Float. $RKT SI % of Float was still 43.8% this morning. That said I suspect a chunk of shorts covered today, won‚Äôt know how many until tomorrow. The borrowing fee went down a bit and the # of shares available to lend increased.

Edit: that said I still think it‚Äôs possible for a major squeeze tomorrow or soon.",7,0,1614898792,PIaymaker7474

39,gppp0k1,It honestly depends on volume but the risk&gt;reward ratio is high. Retail will push this over 40 again and we‚Äôll see where the part starts. If I were to pretend I have a PT ID be lying.,11,0,1614900942,needlamon
