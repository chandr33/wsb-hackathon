Yeah $AMC does have 5b in debt of course, the are a little under 3 million from the assets vs liability ratio and room to improve. Ee won't know how things pan out come Friday since they are opening some theaters. Disney didn't help by moving forward on releasing movies on their platform instead the traditional way via theaters. 

AMC has sufficient cash runway for 7 months based on last reported free cash flow, but has since raised additional capital.

I don't know about the long term for the company but I think that's the closest time frame one can cash out and keep it pushing.",3,0,1614778820,swampfoxinvt
