‚ÄúHeadquartered in Palo Alto, California, the company initially struggled to find investors. According to Karp, Sequoia Capital chairman Michael Moritz doodled through an entire meeting, and a Kleiner Perkins executive lectured the founders about the inevitable failure of their company.[20] The only early investments were $2 million from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel, and $30 million from Thiel himself and his venture capital firm, Founders Fund.[7][8][21][22][23]‚Äù",2,0,1614836617,Psypriest

If interested you'll want to track the 10-year treasury bond yield. The bond yield is correlated with stock rallies. As stocks rise they become 'riskier' and bonds become more attractive as they are a safer return on investment (but still dogshit). The yield was beginning to go parabolic causing the mass selling...it went down some and then back up \[yesterday\] causing more selling. There's only been a handful of times in the last 17 years the yield has risen this much this quickly and it always cools off at about this point.",1,0,1614841325,Long_Conned
