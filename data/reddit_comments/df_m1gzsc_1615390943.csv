""This is gonna be trading at 70 by close today, dropping back into  50â€™s come Monday. Hopefully you guys learn your lesson this time and  stay away from future Ponzi schemes. Youâ€™ve all been manipulated by  massive bot networks hyping this shit for months.""

""Really hoping all these chads slink back to /all after this shit  closes sub-60 and never come back. I donâ€™t even give a fuck about seeing  their loss porn anymore, I just want the sub back to normal.""

15,gqgzxg3,it needs to go a whole lot lower than that before i start losing money lmao.  imagine looking at price a price movement like that with volume that low and thinking it was retail selling off you must be the bad kind of retarded.  if you're so sure then buy some puts and shut the fuck up.  come back and swing your big bearish dick around when it's all said and done instead of making a new dumbfuck level prediction every day.,1,0,1615398829,fish_
