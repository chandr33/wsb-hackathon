I have been except using Friday a few hours before close.

Not sure if it‚Äôs doing anything but I want them to have to give me my 100 shares Vs just taking the money on the margin.

I want my profits but I want my brethren to have their tendies as well.

3,gpmbse2,"Options are precisely what they sound like; the option to buy or sell a stock. When you buy an option you are purchasing the right to execute a transaction at a predetermined price regardless of the market rate. The party you purchased the option from is required to honor that price if you exercise your option, but you - as in the party purchasing the option - have no obligation to do so if it would not be profitable to you.

Tl;dr there's no such thing as cancelling options. They are exercised, traded, or expired.",3,1,1614832796,ThreeLF

6,gpmbw05,"I disagree with the cult too however if a million shares minimum go ITM at each $10 increment and key note, most of the ITM options get exercised, it means a lot.

Exercising these relatively large amounts of shares when considering most of them are via naked options would mean the writers have to buy back at a loss, causing demand to even higher prices.

That said, either

* this just doesn't happen. Relatively low chance given the greeks

* let's say it does, by some miracle. No ape on this sub realistically has the collateral to exercise such options. It would be hedgies fighting other hedgies, which is why I hate the whole ""yeah fuck the hedgies take a stand"" crap, it's much more realistically profitable to leech off the whale than to strike it with a harpoon.",8,0,1614832857,13steinj

The delta changes the most rapidly near the strike price, so a price increase (moving more into the money) would create the need to buy more shares to delta hedge. Here's a [calculator](https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/optionscalculator) you can play with.
