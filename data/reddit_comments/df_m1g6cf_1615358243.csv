3,gqf5st9,"yeah but we have to start somewhere getting the hell off this planet to get our species up to the technological age of traversing the stars. we have survived at least 3 extinction level events that we know of in human history.  
Need to spread out across the stars as a species or we will be gone forever within an estimated 500-1000 years due to cascades brought on by over population on one planet.  
Then there are the certain events like:  
1)the earth is warming, despite it being a natural cycle and nothing we can do to stop or slow it, the environment will suddenly be hostile. We do not currently have the technology to survive such an event. However working on tech to travel to and colonize other planets will lead to this technology.  
Most of modern science and technology was either discovered or rediscovered solely through the NASA program and now NASA is all but defunct.   
2)There is also the fact that the sun will eventually  change moving the habitable zone for human beings back towards Mars, and earth will be completely inhospitable.  
3) All magnetic fields reverse at some point. This includes the Earth. It is believed that the only reason the Earth's magnetic field has not reversed in recorded human history is due to the complex nature of other magnetic fields in our solar system...but should a gamma pulse fly through our solar system this could set off the precarious balance and the Earth's magnetic field will suddenly reverse. This will throw off all technology, animals/insect-pollinators that navigate by magnetic fields will get lost and die, and the Earth's ozone layer will severely weaken if not completely collapse and drift into space.  
These are just a few of the hundreds of certain dooms day scenarios that can and will eventually happen.   
The idea of hiding under the ocean or under the ground will not save anyone from these events.  
And since the technology to get to other planets and learn to colonize and terraform will most likely take decades to centuries to have substantial breakthroughs we need to start now. Hell we should have never ended the lunar program, we have lost decades of valuable research time.",1,0,1615358252,ComoEWL
