35,gqfh0gs,"Never be embarrassed about profits. Tendies are tendies and better than losses.  It takes years to typically get enough liquidity to make the kind of yolo you see in wsb.  Once you have money, more money comes a lot faster (or losses just as much).
It's quite the curve.

It's why the rich can get super rich on even a few percent and why us simpletons have struggled to slowly emerge.

40,gqfhhne,"\[realtalk\] As a finance person, I'd suggest you talk to another finance person (or me) before paying off a mortgage.

Unless you have a rate that hasn't been adjusted in \~15 years, or are planning on retiring and thus need to reduce your monthly expenses, in general, mortgages are the cheapest loans a person has, and it should be really, really easy to find a safe, liquid investment that returns more than the 3-4% interest rate that most mortgages today carry.

Of course, I don't know you or your situation, just something to think about. Cheap dollars on an appreciating asset might not be the best use casino winnings.",1,0,1615369111,Faedro

I've got 220k left and 20 years to go amortization.
2.8 percent with 1 year left in my term.
I know percentages are significantly lower now, I locked in for 5 years when I thought that was already fairly low rate.
In 5 years I'll have paid 80k with only 25k bring principle.

I'm basing this off of making more than 210k as I'm already up 120k as of this morning.

65,gqgq091,"That $80/$25K equity is more than you'd get renting, so don't look at it like you've tossed $55K away. Your rate sounds like a 5-year balloon, I'd refinance your current balance at today's rates (3.3% or whatever), I bet your total payment would be less than what you're paying today when it's all said and done, and only a few grand out of pocket.

It's easier to make a few hundred a month by lifestyle changes than it is to save $100K, so since you've done that, I'd try to hold onto it. Most mutual funds are returning 5-9% for the past few years with relatively no risk. Hell, SPY is double-digits. If you're looking for cashflow, IBM pays a \~5.2% dividend, so you'd keep all your money basically liquid, and your dividend payments would exceed your interest rate if that was something you were interested it. There's a lot of blue chips (mostly gas/oil companies) returning 4-6% in dividends annually.

As the other guy said - if there's something you had planned to do after paying off a house, maybe that route makes sense. But I'd look at a life with a normal mortgage payment like everyone else, and a huge stash of cash on the side just in case, unlike everyone else living check to check.",1,0,1615395238,Faedro
