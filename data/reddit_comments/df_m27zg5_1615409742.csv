If the asks are 10 at 100, 10 at 95, 10 at 90, 5 at 75 and I sell 35 at market price, I dont get 35x100 (highest ask),  I scoop up the next 35 in the list and the price then reflects 75$.  

If there aren't a lot of asks to buy, a low relative volume of single entity with a ton of shares could eat a downward wall to a price like that.",13,0,1615409744,wehrmann_tx

49,gqhqp4l,"Remember! Even on SSR they can short the stock on an uptick! 

Usually you can short a stock at any time you want. GME dropped more than 10% at some point today so it has been placed on SSR (Short Sale Restriction) 

This means that if the price is already going down, you are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, you are allowed to.

My thoughts on this is that lunchtime today was a tester. If they’re sat on the shorts that have gone from iBorrowDesk, then tomorrow they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left. 

Now if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell. 

If I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up. 

This is not financial advice, I’m just an ape who IS NOT FUCKING SELLING
