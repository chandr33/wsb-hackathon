1,gpk4i0l,Honestly no. As long as you don't close any open positions in GME you ape,8,0,1614794454,TomTom_ZH
2,gpk4wgr,"Very good DD, genuinely seems like a good investment opportunity as that sectors gets more and more into the tech world and it's user base grows. However, don't you think it might be detroned by other bigger corps (ex; Spotify) when they realise they could make some moners there?",6,0,1614794628,Bladings

4,gpk5eva,"It‚Äôs definitively a possibility agreed. But Anghami already has that footing and it‚Äôs not something to scoff at. Lots of exclusive premieres and exclusive streaming with the biggest artists in that region. Honestly following Spotify closely the last few years, I can‚Äôt see them doing something this involved. They operate on a more broad scale and just roll out new tools for artists and new updates to the app etc. They haven‚Äôt really done much to try to expand their market and I can‚Äôt imagine them doing so, especially with Anghamis choke on this particular areas market, I just don‚Äôt see it happening but it‚Äôs always a possibility for sure.",1,0,1614794849,Kaamzs
5,gpkf0pw,great analysis. I can confirm that Anghami is very popular for music streaming in Egypt and arab gulf countries. This stock has great potenional I guess. Unfortunatly I couldn't find the ticker $VMAC in etoro.,2,0,1614799006,ramisalama
