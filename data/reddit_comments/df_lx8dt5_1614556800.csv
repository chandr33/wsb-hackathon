28,gpm0ncv,"I did yolo everything into GME. But had to get out for other plays. Also your thread title doesnâ€™t really tie in with the body of your post. If you want an explanation for why everything is going down, look at SPY and ^DJI 1month chart.",4,0,1614826693,Dio_Eraclea

30,gpm2ntn,"Yea, despite the post not being super long I had to take several breaks to sort through my thoughts. It doesn't surprise me that it kind of derailed from the original premise. I wanted to generate a dialogue and was not sure how to proceed for a while. I took several breaks through writing it and I settled on just being honest with how I have been approaching WSB as of late.

There are tons of apes in WSB, equally as many different points of view. I hope when you got out of GME you did so with a positive tendy gain, and I wish tendies upon you in your future yolos.",-8,0,1614827730,Rebelsquadro
