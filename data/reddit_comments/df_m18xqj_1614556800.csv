17,gqcbqh9,"Ditto. I'm a retard with an average of 276. Wish I'd bought a heck of a lot more at $40, but was more convinced that the hedgies would find a way to weasel out of the squeeze (legally or not). Still didn't sell though.",1,0,1615306434,djentonaut

23,gqd984i,"Same boat here. Was convinced the game had been well and truly rigged when in reality they were just lowering the drawbridge to let everyone in. I told a few mates about GME after I'd bought and by the time they'd done their own reading up on it it was in freefall, they bought the dip and are in the green now. I didn't and am still in the red. Happy for them but the FOMO is real. I hope to see you at the promised land at 276 and hopefully far far beyond.",1,0,1615320870,GutsGloryAndGuinness
