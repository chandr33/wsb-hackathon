94,gpmmpwe,"I think you are mistaken. I looked at it too and saw it as a potential winner. It has been shorted forever bc of sentiment being against retail. Every article for a while about them specifically mentioned the ‚Äúretail apocalypse.‚Äù So overblown. It is true that they got hit hard by tenant bankruptcies and closures but they still managed to pull through and reinstate dividends AND beat earnings estimates. Plus they collected a lot of Q4 rent in Q1, so they should have even better earnings. They also beat Q1 estimates btw. I witnessed it popping after hours and got excited, but then the analysts shrugged their shoulders and said ‚Äúyeah, they smashed earnings but still are involved in retail.‚Äù Too bad they make money instead of promising to make EVs two years from now or lose lots of money pretending that one day they will be profitable. They have a relatively new CEO and are planning on bringing in more high value tenants like pottery barn. They have used pop up shops to temporarily plug in some holes left by previous tenants. That plus reopening makes this a good play if sentiment turns. And all that needs is a wsb post.",8,0,1614840487,throwawayiquit
