But if we are going to retake the battle, we need to get sqqq moving the other way. They are trying to send sqqq into the momentum buy range. If sqqq is making money, then the rest of Americans will see an opportunity to make money. If everyone piles into sqqq, the whole Nasdaq will crash. They are even going so far to short the bond market to drive inflationary fears (which are highly unlikely). It is all to get a pile into a eft short of gme. 

If sqqq momentum is not destroyed sub 11, this rocket ship will fall short of the moon. We need parachute ape defenses",2,0,1615403360,ASengerd
