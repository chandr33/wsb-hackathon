42,gqhws7h,I don’t know if it is bad or not. It just shows that they sold a bunch of shares and that made price lose 50% almost instantly (it took 20 min because of trading halts). They didn’t need extreme volume to make the price tank. I think they will do it again because with preloaded puts they must have made many millions today.
