0,gqgxxuc,Anyone else not able to buy the dip? Just tried to put an order and got “(100906)Your market order cannot be accepted right now because the last trade price is not in line with the current bid/ask price. Please change your order to a limit order.” I am an idiot and unsure of why lol,5,0,1615398177,JonPrime

7,gqh3z7d,Yeah its gonna run there was zero volume on that drop. They essentially just gave us another 4 million cheap shares that they'll have to pay back much higher lol. Noone falls for their stuff anymore. They're all outta ammo,1,0,1615400311,NoobTrader378
