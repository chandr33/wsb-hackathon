21,gq9zh5b,"All these 100-500k yolos that are just jumping in today are the kind of people will sell for 25% or 50% gains and we'll never hear from them again,  which is understandable",7,0,1615251580,loveNthundermifflin
22,gqa1nl8,Holding at $40 is easy. Still holding at $10k THAT is going to be the challenge. 💎🙌🏻🦍🚀🎉🍌,1,0,1615252772,philipfuchs
23,gqa3ci3,"Just a random thought. Chewy is valued at 32bn. And btw Chewy still doesn’t report profit. Gamestop is currently valued at 13 bn. Gaming is by far a more valuable and growth heavy industry. The current console cycle, the insane PR GmE got out of this whole thing, RC’s midas touch makes me believe even after the squeeze GME can be easily valued at 35-50bn.
