As a company, I don't understand the fundamentals enough to justify anywhere near a 30 Billion dollar valuation.

A $5 share price would be a 5x revenue multiple.

32,gqe2t1f,"Yes, companies in growth mode are encouraged to take losses as they grow market share and invest in their product. They are purchasing companies like [Loom.ai](https://Loom.ai) to improve their avatar's graphics and add facial gestures and have invested in expanding the functionality of their platform by investing in automated translation software.

So in short, they are investing in growth.

They do have $1.3B in cash and have a very small customer acquisition cost.

The fact that they are not profitable is meaningless - if they had more money, they would spend it on further growth and enhancements to the platform.

In other words, they are unprofitable by choice, not because the company cannot figure out how to make money.

They literally print money by selling Robux. Robux cost nothing to create, but they do incur a 'cost' when they sell them through the Apple store (royalties paid to Apple), since they do not count those are revenue until they are actually SPENT within the platform (as I understand it).

Another large 'cost' is stock-based employee compensation, which allows them to hire top software engineers to continue growing the platform.",6,0,1615334765,hammondish

35,gqe3xp4,"This is neither WoW or Tomagotchi.  
This is 'Ready Player One' - go watch the movie and then go buy RBLX.

Here's how easy it is to understand: Roblox sells Robux to kids. It costs basically nothing to create a Robux. Kids buy these like crack.

Nearly $1B revenue last year on 90%+ growth.

66%+ of kids in America aged 9-12 are playing this because their friends are on it and they don't wanna miss out.

Customer Acquisition costs are almost nothing.

Roblox itself isn't really a game

Kids are able to play millions of games WITHIN Roblox with the same Avatar/Virtual Identity. Kids are invested in these avatars, as they see them as a digital representation of themselves - it IS their digital identity. And they don't just play games in Roblox - they go to concerts, hang out with their friends, have pets... it's like a parallel universe.

A good way to look at this is that it's a gaming platform + an entertainment platform + a social network + a currency + a marketplace.

Other gaming companies rely on being able to produce the next 'big hit' - Roblox lets the community create the hits, and it just builds the technology to facilitate this community...

All while printing and selling ROBUX (money) at no cost to them.",6,0,1615335363,hammondish

48,gqesf84,Thatâ€™s the point theyâ€™re playing video games on zoom school. When schools open in person they canâ€™t play video games during school. With the exception of a few pc classes itâ€™s all textbook and paper for kids. Screw listening to the teacher when you can play video games during zoom school. Covid is why gaming jumped in 2020 because everyone is at home. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not feeling the stock long term. It could do well in the short term but once vaccines are in arms and schools open back up this stock will drop below the $45 target. This might be ok for a scalp.,1,0,1615348736,iduser4
