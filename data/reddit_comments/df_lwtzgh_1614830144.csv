22,gpmwy2c,"Citadel is in the dumb money acquisition phase. The 3-cup ball swindle has 3 pieces. 1: make the mark feel like a genius by letting him win and playing dumb. 2: Wait till they collectively surge and push in their nest eggs and replicate their exuberence, then 3: stop them out by retesting a panic sell 180. It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit. The first hit is free, the high will be like your first attempt at heroin, you will be superman, it's the next 100 that will ruin you.",2,0,1614849808,streetcleanermed

24,gpmydus,"Its not human nature, its external forces acting to try and fit humans into their moral/idealogical mold.

Any term referencing stupidity will ultimately join the treadmill and become an insult, because you haven't changed anyones mind or changed anything about the real world just by using a different word. It's fucken pointless and stupid moral busywork. Some goes for other euphemism treadmills such as racial slurs.",1,0,1614851219,PM_me_large_fractals
