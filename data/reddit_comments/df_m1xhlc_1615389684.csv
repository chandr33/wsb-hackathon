18,gqgc9dt,"They don't want to buy, because a short is a bet that the price will go down to a certain level. If they buy, they negate the bet and waste the short.
So they hold on to the short, hoping that the price does go down. Meantime apes push the price up, meaning when they do have to buy, the damage will get exponentially bigger.
