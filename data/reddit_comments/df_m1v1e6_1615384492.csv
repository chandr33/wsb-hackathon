How about this. If we see any of this ""runaway inflation"" in the coming year,s actually even by 2030; then I will give you the credit and publicly call you the King of all Kings.

More seriously though, a fundamental misunderstanding exists on how inflation has been balanced by cost reduction via importing cheaper goods and technology. That will continue to happen, AND the $'s ""exhorbitant priviledge"" will continue to exist.
