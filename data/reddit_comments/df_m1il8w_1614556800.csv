15,gqdurgb,"If you don’t have the capital to exercise an option then it’s pretty obvious you can’t. So yes you need to sell the option when you are comfortable before the option expires. (Remember every day you wait to sell the option the more dramatic the price will change if you are OTM and getting closer to expiration) 
So sell and buy shares of whatever you desire or buy more options. Or cash out. This is a casino. I like the stock.",3,0,1615330629,EnergyMatrix

17,gqdv0w8,"Well, I can tell you that you shouldn’t buy options if you don’t understand how to evaluate the profit potential. 

But since you are gambling, go with whatever impulse got you into it in the first place. 

Lots of bad advice on here. I am still holding stock that is up 385% from my purchase price. I wont sell it, so I’m not even sure why I bother still buying more. So consider this a warning, stock holding is a serious problem",5,0,1615330757,G_yebba
