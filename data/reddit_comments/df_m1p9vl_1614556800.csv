26,gqf11t8,"A few months ago in November, the company had a market valuation of 40 mil. The current market cap is over $2 billion. In fact,  their market cap is likely way higher than $2 billion because most websites haven't updated their figures for outstanding shares, and SNDL continues to issue new stock to stay solvent. 

Revenues have stagnated. Earnings are down. Stonk never stays up because SNDL issues new stock every damn time. I used to like the stock, but then I did a little DD. 

Weed is good. Weed is the future. But invest in a real weed company that can compete in a growing market. This ain't it.

28,gqf1eli,They have $800 million more in cash than they did back then even after paying off their debt. That‚Äôs about $0.70 in cash-on-hand value alone,1,0,1615354746,Typical_Turtle33
29,gqf2t7j,"Do you have a source for the 800 million? Last I saw, they had ~700 million CAD, which is about 500 million USD, and not accounting for their liabilities. 

Even if they hypothetically could pay off their debt and still have $800 mil in cash, I'm struggling to see a ~$3 billion valuation when they're still hemorrhaging money at an increasing rate, they're having to issue stock to remain solvent, revenue has stagnated, competition is stiff... I just don't see it. Even in an acquisition, who would pay more than $2 billion for an unprofitable company that does 60 million in revenue? 

I fell out of love with this ticker.",1,0,1615355817,Drink_Whiskey

31,gqf3cyc,"Revenue was only stagnant because they cut 50% of workforce and switched strategies to a higher retail presence in summer 2020 which has higher margins and lower revenue. Everyone knew revenue would stagnant for a quarter or two. New numbers will be released on March 17th. If they used the $800 million at the same rate as the Zenabis deal it would be about $144 million a year in income alone. 30x earnings would be very cheap valuation and would make the stock 2-3x higher than where it is. Whether sundial wants to be a loan shark to other weed companies while gaining equity or buying them outright, they will make money and are setup for success either way.",1,0,1615356243,Typical_Turtle33

35,gqf8o0g,"I haven't found any that I particularly like. I think cannabis stocks are in a small bubble. Long term, I think they'll go down before rallying hard. But I would want to be holding onto the best companies that are poised to dominate the competition. Right now, SNDL is not looking like one of those companies IMO.

48,gqfqzh5,"I'd suggest looking for a company able to produce at a cost around $1-2/gram at this point. Weed is a real cost competitive market and big companies have to pay for a lot of overhead as a result of their size. A large company producing at $3+/gram can make money in the green rush for a couple years (or if the have a government issued monopoly) but will ultimately get priced out. Also, vertical models that include farms, dispensaries, and processors are proving dominant in the industry.  That's just a starting point before looking at the financials (mainly to make sure they aren't crooks and are improving). Or you could compare them using institutional holdings if you want to follow the big dogs that hire analysts to determine value and risk and skip some leg work.",1,0,1615377801,Alphawog
