18,gpj8gd4,"Evaluating ownership of stocks!!!!

I’m sorry but I see a ton of retarded posts here saying stuff like “Vanguard bought $2M worth of my stock. To the moon!!”

No. This is idiotic. Some of the largest asset managers in the world are Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, State Street, Schwab, and T. Rowe. A huge percentage of their businesses are passive funds and ETFs. They buy whatever the index creator tells them to. If their ETF gets inflows they buy more. If it gets outflows they sell. They don’t “like the stock,” they don’t care. They don’t make more money if the stock goes up or down. They own EVERY SINGLE STOCK IN THE MARKET. 

Most of these firms also have ACTIVE funds, which are actively managed and trying to beat an index. If an actively managed fund buys a stock, they like it. These are a smaller part of most of their businesses (T. Rowe and Fido still have big active businesses) Cathie Wood runs active funds. When she buys or sells, it matters! 

Generally speaking active funds buying stocks is a “good sign” (although they’re obviously not always right). Passive investors buying or selling stock is no sign unless they’re doing it because of new index inclusion which are well known in advance (see TSLA). 

A lot of passive investors in a low float stock actually IS a hypothetical good set up for a gamma or short squeeze. This is because they are indifferent to price. If Vanguard owns 95% of a stock in its passive funds and it goes up 1000% they... do nothing. The more passive investors in a smaller market cap stock the more retail trading effects pricing because there are few natural sellers (it is price inelastic) 
Good thread here: https://twitter.com/macrocephalopod/status/1362758036188758016?s=20

However! This may only be the case between rebalances. XRT is an “equal weighted ETF” for example that rebalances every quarter. It will sell some of the best performers and buy some of the worst performers. 
On the other hand S&amp;P 500 is market cap weighted index. It’s rebalances are more about additions/exclusions. 

Anyway, generally speaking, stop saying sht like “Blackrock (a multi *trillion* dollar manager) bought $3 *million* dollars of this stock” and stop thinking it means anything unless you want to lose all of your money.",63,1,1614780183,Verb0182
