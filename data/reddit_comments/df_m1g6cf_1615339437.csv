Home construction will have to slow down unless something happens with this lumber shortage. Right now I'm overhearing the owners of all the local home builders calling my husband one by one hoping they can get on the schedule for lumber and most are being turned away. They are probably hitting up all the local lumberyards with similar results. I-Joist shortage is bad right now and these companies are willing to pay double for floor trusses to use instead. This is limited by shops being able to produce enough so only a few favorite builders are making the cut. People are already offering 50k over asking price and still losing bidding wars on existing homes. Who knows how much prices will skyrocket until people just can't afford it. Nobody wants to sell their current homes because any real move will be a lateral one.
