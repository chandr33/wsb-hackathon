2,gqki12o,"It's just common sense to me. The SEC and the powers that be will never let a manipulated meme stock that has worldwide attention reach those levels. They shit a brick at $480 and pulled the plug and we can clearly see they're fighting the current rise hard.

For me, 1k is possible with the off chance MMs and the SEC don't fuck with things (they will). $500-750 is probably a more realistic peak but don't listen to me because this is not financial advice. 

I like the stock and all, but it's not worth trillions.",1,0,1615468416,LifeWithoutRegerts

8,gqlihyt,Yup. It’s sad that the culty nature of GME gives 18 downvotes to the truth.... literally every bank managing their fucking money would default if these crazy numbers occurred.,1,0,1615485556,UnUnimportant-
9,gqlykax,"However, for the exact reason that all eyes are on this meme stock wouldn’t they step aside? U.S. likes to stand tall with their flaccid dick in hand and claim free market, when clearly based on what we saw in January is untrue. 

Hypothetically, say they intervened just was the stock hit $1k. They halted trading for a few days to sort shit out. In you opinion, do you think this would create a public outrage? Because at this point it’s not only public entities loosing money, but also big players who are long loosing money. 

Idk I’m just a dumb ape trying to make sense of the simulation I’m in. Ape wants to make small wrinkle and learn. Just making it clear that my intention is not to argue but to learn and make sense of it all",1,0,1615492487,DressYourLonliness

16,gqniixd,"Look between me and you, outside this whole ""Ape"" shit... there's no way gme is getting close to 5k. It got near 500 and brokers pulled some shady shit. What's stopping them from doing it again? Nothing, that's what.

I'm overly optimistic and biased bc I have shares but 1k, while very unlikely, is possible. 5k is ridiculous and anything above that is absurd.",2,0,1615520208,pschnet007
