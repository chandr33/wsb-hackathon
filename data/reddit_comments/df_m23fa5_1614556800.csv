13,gqhrpua,"Nope, I bought in back in Jan, i made some money
but dropped out when all the bullshit ""informational memes"" came out telling me to stay in. This stock is a casino and people posting theses Melvin/Citadel reposts, those firms are likely not even shorting this stock at this point. This is a 10-14$ stock until Cohen does something meaningful to affect this failing companies bottom line. hell, I'll give you 40$ in this overly inflated market but it sure as hell ain't a 200-300$ stock. I don't have the pocketbooks that the people who are pulling the strings to make the stock go up up up do to get people to buy it so they can then sell on the way up. This stock has zero fundamentals for real investing until they fix things. Good luck in your quest riding a pump and dump. 

This is not investment advice I am not an investment or financial advisor. At the time of writing this I have no interest/possession in this stock whatsoever.",0,0,1615410201,onelastshot19
