The only dd I know is that the CEO is currently fighting the shorts and has the 9th of march as the d day date. 
Not sure what they are doing or releasing but it seems aimed at spiking the price to fuck the shorts. Not sure about a long term hold tho.

Not sure how much it will fall today, but it seems destined to hit at least $50 - $100 by 03/09",3,0,1614784309,fountainoftales
