60,gqh235p,"So I guess I sort of predicted the dip? I was just finishing writing the post and then checked the price and it was dropping like a stone. I'm not sure if that's why it was removed or if I maybe added the wrong flair. I've messaged the mods asking if they could help. In the mean time, the gist of what I was saying is that there are probably going to be a few false peaks ahead, this last one being one of them, and we need to hang tight because the price is going to be all over the place right before it goes infinite.

65,gqh5fpx,"Hijacking the top comment because apes need to know this. I think I fucked up the flair or had too low karma or something so the post was deleted. In light of the recent drop my belief in my theory is a lot stronger. This really is VW squeeze 2.0 and it's going to be a bumpy ride. I think there's going to be another bull run but this time we're going to blow past the high we set in Jan **but** (and this is important to know) there will probably be an even bigger drop than this one, we could potentially bottom out below $100 again or wherever the retail support level is. A massive drop like that preceded the VW squeeze and I think it was due to the massive amount of volatility caused by Porsche's acquisition of the majority of shares. We're doing the same thing right now, buying and HODLING for dear life and sweet tendies. The price is going to swing like a big dicked dancer and it'll be like a pendulum until the squeeze happens and the shorts get called after which we can name our price. If the price drops below $100 I'm going in big but only with money I can throw away without worrying. This is my own personal decision, I'm not advising anyone to do the same. Use your best judgement. Past performance doesn't predict future performance.
