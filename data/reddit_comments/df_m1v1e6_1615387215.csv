56,gqg6uzc,"I agree that inflation fears are  completely overblown. However, I think this is bearish for stocks. Stocks like inflation. Deflation crushes stocks. 

When you have inflation, yields rise, and the fed has to print more money to keep yields low. If yields are low, the Fed doesn't need to buy more bonds.

If I thought there would be a lot of inflation, I would be buying stocks. If you think there is deflation, you should hold cash and bonds. 

Everyone has this backwards IMO.",1,0,1615387262,NorthernLeaf
