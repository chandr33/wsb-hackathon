51,gqahhw9,"I disagree. It‚Äôs about solidarity. The same solidarity required in the prisoners dilemma. It‚Äôs not exactly the same, this is more complex and statistical. There are hundreds of thousand of players with a continuous pay off variable. But cooperation has the best outcome, being early is better than being late. A big difference here though is being too early is also bad. It might triple in a week. But the cooperate (no one rats) or don‚Äôt be late (rat out) being optimal is the same so it‚Äôs kinda strictly determined. The opportunity cost of selling too early doesn‚Äôt apply since the model assumes that selling triggers a price drop. This is a major flaw in the model but in my opinion doesn‚Äôt invalidate it‚Äôs conclusions. If I had GME I would hold till tomorrow and reevaluate then, with stops in place.

73,gqb5f8q,"I know exactly what you mean my dude. I originally had the idea to invest in GME back in October/November. I had no idea about WSB or that there was a squeeze incoming, or what a squeeze even was. Had never invested in my life, but I had opened a RH account back in August, for no reason. I literally only had the idea because I had heard about GME's sudden partnership with Microsoft. Seemed weird, because their company seemed to be on the verge of death, or so I thought. So I was going to buy 1,500 shares, because why not.

But then I didn't. Election had me paranoid about the country and stock market, spent the money on some BS instead. Now I found out I could've been a millionaire by now lol. Hindsight always hurts, regardless of money. But I use it as motivation. Because unlike Tesla or Amazon, our opportunity is still in front of us. We aren't so far removed that it would be impossible to make something. And even if GME wasn't a thing, there will always be the next big thing in the stock market at some point.
