2,gqefbyf,"There are a couple offshoots. But none of them are quite the same.  It seems the powers that be are ok with the state of affairs here too.  I guess it's lucrative for them?

Though I kind of wonder what the end goal is for the G stop usurpers?  Obviously their claims of 6969 or 10000 or 100,000 per share isn't happening.  So I wonder when it does finally tap out where are these people going?  Do they really take their gains and go, do they bandwagon onto some other 'short squeeze', do they baghold forever to 'make a point'?  

Because we're now at or approaching a place where bagholders from the first spike can walk away.  But I don't think they will.  So I wonder when they're planning on bailing?  

How many times can you hype your G Stop position before you get bored with the rise and fall and rise and fall of it?  Especially since you're not taking profits at any point, just watching it yoyo. The questions are mostly rhetorical, but it does make me wonder.",6,1,1615341425,Im_A_MechanicalMan

Some guy was given a 5 day ban for spamming in WSB. He made a r/fuckwsbmods sub which was figured out and then Dan inKuwait and the other mods spammed it, and then made a r/fuckthefuckwsbmodssub to retaliate. 

Eventually the guy was permabaned and then banned all the mods except OIP on fuckwsbmods. So we invited him over to r/fizzystonks to hang out. We then banned him and told him to release the mods we like and his ban will be released from
Fizzy.

[SPY Bollinger](https://imgur.com/a/d3ahxLf)

Last night I felt with great conviction we would test 378 with possibility of downside. All TA was pointing in that direction. I reversed course once a finger entered the scale. Just as the plunge protection team had halted us from visiting the 360s and left europoors in the dust, China issued the buy signal ‚Äúwe‚Äôre too low imo‚Äù and reversed the course of the market. Just as the bulls were on the ropes for two trading sessions. Now the Bollinger bands have tightened into consolatory formation &amp; any dip we see has a pretty set floor. It would take a more than large weakening event for Bears to take control. (10yr auction tomorrow?) but intuition is telling me to look at the largest signal of all, that it is still indeed a rigged market with a get out of jail free card of infinite toner. Consolidation is needed further if we want to break 400 but the major danger has been averted imo. Upside is coming. 

I. Would. Be. Shocked. If we fall tomorrow on that auction below 378. Doesn‚Äôt feel likely right now at all. Downside is still 378 but a break below that? Not feeling it imo.",5,1,1615344115,Tangelooo
