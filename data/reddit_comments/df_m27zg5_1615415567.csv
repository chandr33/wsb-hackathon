Certain people knew this was coming, and I honestly believe they dumped and bought back in to hedge against their own losses. 

They fucking gained ground on us today because they're not required to play by the same rules, and that makes me want to eat an entire box of crayons. 

I know everyone's gonna say the government doesn't give a shit, but does anyone have AOC's number? Or Bernie? Or know how to make a FOIA request? People need to go to jail for this. 

I just emptied all my cash reserves into Fidelity, because even at $270, it's a bargain and I want to watch the fucking HF's burn. Burn.

Full disclosure, part of why I'm pissed is that I was trying to do market buy for 135 shares when it got close to 200, but Fidelity glitched, and when I refreshed I forgot to set it back to ""buy"". I fucked it up and hit market sell. And even though the price was at $203, they sold for $180.00 for some goddamn reason. By the time I realized my mistake it was back up to $223 and I bought back in, but I essentially just jizzed $7k into the wind.
