1,gqh2uwc,"Serious question. According to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), the number of available shorts hasn't changed during this dip. What could cause it to dip so much, with such low volume? Is it just that the size of the sell volume during the dip was large, in proportion to the rest of the days volume? Obviously they hit stop-losses and day traders bailed during the dip, but I'm more curious about if this was a tactic, or if day traders simply started it by taking profits. Just curious. Still HODLING!

220@$125.61 average

EDIT: What I didn't realize is that when shorts are borrowed, there is a 3 day period that they can be used, before they have to be returned, ie ""You can borrow these shorts for 3 days, but if you don't use them in that time, you have to give them back"". I mistakenly thought that when a short was borrowed it was immediately sold, which doesn't make any sense. So the consensus is that they accumulated shorts over the past few days, and used them all at once. Thanks /u/_Exordium, for the explaination!",11,0,1615399890,Trevonious
