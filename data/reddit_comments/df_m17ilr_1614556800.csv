47,gqc0vgf,"Yup. I am setting a stop loss on as few shares as possible, to equal my cost basis, once it reaches a certain point where I'll be comfortable with the number of shares I have to paperhand to do that.

The rest I'm holding to the moon. But I ain't rich enough not to try to get back my cost basis in case I miss the time to sell when it comes.

I'm only doing it after we're significantly above that point, though. I'm going to be disappointed if it triggers. I'd much rather sell out all at the top when the time comes.

And as others have said for the love of god do NOT stop-loss ALL your GME, because the price is so volatile it's likely to trigger regardless of whether we're still squeezing. If you MUST secure a small amount of gains (like if you're poor and need to cover cost-basis like me) that's one thing, but don't risk the whole biscuit trying to make sure you save yourself a bite.",1,0,1615302155,bestakroogen

69,gqc995v,"Or you could set a trailing stop loss, which is exactly what you described, except the new stops are set automatically every time a new high is reached.  

For instance- if the current price is $220, you could set a trailing stop loss at $20 below current price.  As long as GME never goes over $220, you have a $200 stop limit.  If it goes to $225, your stop limit goes up to $205.  

If it goes to $800, your stop limit will be at $780. 

Your stop limit will trail the maximum price reached by the dollar amount of your choosing.  You can make it as big as you want if you‚Äôre afraid of being stopped out too early.

82,gqczmcr,"I agree with literally nothing you said. This stonk is way way WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY to volitile for stop losses. Another people have said, the price jumps down to much to make an educated guess I'm a good stop loss price. I've seen it dip, and other stocks dip ~$100 for a split second and that split second is all the time a trigger needs.

Secondly, where's the explanation of Trailing Loss Stops? Huh? Where are they? If you're fortunate enough to be at or above breaking even, you should be looking at trailing stop loss, not stop loss. They are less maintenance. THAT BEING SAID, no, absolutely NO stop loss orders, of any kind, should be employed upon this, or any, ""meme"" stock. 

THAT BEING SAID, I realize that not everyone entered this/these stocks with the same end goal in mind. Some just want to make money to pay bills. Some just want savings, some want free money, some are day trading, and of course there are the üíéüñê. So, with that in mind, it's not ""WRONG"" To have a stop loss of any kind, or even a low sell point. It's okay to be greedy and other people telling you how to spend YOUR money don't always have your best interest in mind. 

It's not wrong to want some money now, even at the risk of making the üíéüñê fight harder. If you have a clear goal of how much money you need. AS LONG as you understand the risk you're taking. Not the loss, but what you'll potentially be missing out on.

Furthermore, if you're one of the ones that YOLO'd all the money you have and then some and are fortunate enough to already be breaking even and you need that money NOW (or bills), take it. This sub may hate you, villify you, but at the end of the day, it's your money. HOWEVER, If possible, a better plan for those in need now would be to take what you need NOW, and leave the rest to üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

TL;DR: don't do stop loss of any kind on these ""meme"" stocks, you WILL (most likely) lose. It's your money and nobody should tell you how to spend YOUR money
