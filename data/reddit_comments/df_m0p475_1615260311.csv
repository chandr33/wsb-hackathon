1,gqajbv0,"It has certainly become a game, I suppose it always was though the whales have now possibly helmed the wheel. While the retail trader slept cozy in our tight little bunks, (or in the bathtub down the hall from the wife’s bed) dreaming of a three way with Cohen and Musk. I do believe there are some massive players at work here. The theory you have posted might just work. There’s certainly a lot going on that we can’t see. I do believe it will be beneficial to retail holders, very beneficial. They don’t care about us, though they have no problem with us benefiting hugely as their gains at this point will re-define tendie. It’s almost like an ironic friendly take over.",1,0,1615262603,tigebea

3,gqajxyt,"They’d have an extremely hard time doing that. 
Numbers speak, there’s enough data out there showing who’s purchased what when. 
CNBC might try to blame wsb though I feel it’s evident who’s playing who at this point. I’m just along for the ride with a few golden tickets at this point. 
I do not tell friends family or co workers anything about anything related to that thing. (I don’t keep anything from my wife’s boyfriend though).",2,0,1615262974,tigebea

Going up a few miles and then popping through space will get your data between Chicago and Singapore a hell of a lot faster than digging a trench the whole way.,1,0,1615263073,SomeGuyNamedPaul

Nothing against you OP but it’s not the same. I get the gist of the message but I am buying fractional shares from my iPhone in 2021 between work emails with extra money I have. It just rubs me the wrong way that what we are doing can be compared to landing on the beaches of Normandy while being shot at by everything.

I am not of that generation nor know anyone particularly of that generation but I didn’t have my courage tested to those limits and thankfully  I probably never will.

25,gqawdf8,"I have heard about this too. HFT is a world on it's own. I read about a smaller exchange is the U.S. deliberately making their customers data go through a long loop of coiled up fiber just to make the connection slow and the play field 'even'. Also no in-house servers for top clients like almost every major exchange has. 

That was their niche, they wanted to provide an exchange with little to no HFT. This was few years ago, don't know how they fared up.",1,0,1615271732,Linkomies

60,gqcccf5,"Doesn’t matter. The single biggest determining factor of max share price is going to be the “diamond-handedness” of retail plus long HFs. To think both of these groups will hold until $3,000+ in unison is absurd. Long HFs will take profits first because they are smart, then retail will take lesser profits second because, well, human nature. Like I said, I hope I’m completely wrong. I hope GME goes to $10,000. I’ll probably be holding too long, but in my opinion I see share price maxing out around $800-$900 before you see massive profit taking. I don’t think you see GME crash to $38 again like last time. I think GME will consolidate between $150-$200 after the impending mass sell-off, so risk-reward ratio right now, I believe, is still very low ($232 at time of writing this).

Tangentially, I’ve had a bunch of success buying and selling OTM calls during the last week. Because of GME’s continued volatility I think this will continue to be a nice opportunity until we get over $500-$600. Then I’d start reconsidering. Good luck, we’ll all need it.",1,0,1615306664,GringoExpress

IMO $2k is very likely, $4k would be the upper limit of when I start to get paranoid of people selling. Tesla hit it last year, so it's possible. $800 seems low since there are a few calls that will get covered then. Should expect the price to jump a few days after it hits $800",1,0,1615317326,BladedD
