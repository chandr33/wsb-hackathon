1,gpfm3v7,"I can tell you're part of the new 8 million that thinks every stock with short interest is gonna squeeze.

LUMN was a fairly dead play. I'm in 2022 calls betting on their rebranding recovery and their fibre network expanding, and integrating the new management team of level 3",3,0,1614704860,longGERN

3,gpfmgi9,Hence why i flagged it as a discussion and not DD. I dont understand why this community is so snarky to newcomers. Get off your high horse for a second and understand that people need to start somewhere.,1,0,1614705014,JJShrink

6,gpfn92e,"It wasn’t necessarily the metrics of the stock that drove me to ask. It was more/so everything I had been reading. The purpose of the post was not to suggest a squeeze, but to ask a community of people that know more than me. I suppose I could gave worded it differently. But either way, I appreciate the response!",1,0,1614705362,JJShrink
7,gpfna03,do you get dividend while owning those? seems like the only real play for LUMN is get 25 cents a share.,1,0,1614705373,procheeseburger
8,gpfnil9,Check out the lumen valuation by investors podcast. Pretty good lesson. But management discussion and calls is where you'll find the info. It's a fairly big company with lots going on. Century link business dying off while new networks will hopefully succeed. That's my bet.,3,0,1614705474,longGERN
