4,gqb9xby,revolut was one of the only apps holding on and letting users buy during the robbing the hood war and restrictions. GME is going far is the difference is a couple of bucks ill still go along,1,0,1615284585,pepsimanishere

7,gqba1f1,"Maybe do some research before posting - it displays prices with a 15 minute differential, like most brokers, no need to scream for conspiracies",1,0,1615284698,louisoconnor
8,gqba1zg,one of the last to do so and didn’t even go a full day i think. they sent a full apology with explanation that they got restricted from their broker right on the spot,1,0,1615284713,pepsimanishere
9,gqba4qw,"Revolut isn't trash, just displays pre market with 15 minute differential like many other websites do, it's one of the only brokers which didn't block trades during the initial squeeze",1,0,1615284787,louisoconnor

14,gqbalej,"In general it is trash. This might be a policy, but they suffer with slowness, fulfilling orders that were cancelled, low amount of tickers, no options, issues with automatic orders and the list goes on...",1,0,1615285232,BrandNewGraySun

17,gqbapf1,"I disagree with your statement BUT I have noticed that revolut have disabled their in app chat support.

19,gqbasv7,no revolut is their own bank that has trading with a simple buy and sell button in europe and UK which mean it doesn’t also offer options bec its not in the US and nothing here offers Options to answer the guy above and it had a broker that couldn’t fill the orders so technically they couldn’t do anything ab it during that time as that broker was used by a lot of stock trading companies such as degiro and others,1,0,1615285425,pepsimanishere
