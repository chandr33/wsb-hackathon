5,gqdwuaq,"Your dates are off a bit. First of all, the 90-day partial unlock is only for 20% of locked shares. Plus, that already happened. The date of filing of S-1 was November 13th 2020 (it doesn't go by the IPO date).

So only 20% of locked shares begun to be sold as of Feb. 11 2021. Obviously it's been going down since then if you look at the last peak near 175 -- pretty much straight down since, probably compounded the selloff as it aligned with the general tech sell off in Feb.

So, the full share lockup period ends 180 days after the filing of the S1, which puts us at Wednesday, May 12, 2021.

11,gtuhd45,"Check out the 125 C expiring Dec 17th 2021. Typical daily volume for the contract is in the single digits, no joke maybe 3 or 4 days out of the past four months with more than 10 contracts traded, but yesterday volume was 451. And on that volume the open interest jumped from 49 to 461.",1,0,1617910217,dicboi
