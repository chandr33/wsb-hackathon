Right now a PLTR Jan 15 22 2.5c is $2180. The break even is negative. So the total cost of buying and exercising immediately is less that the worth of the stock. Presumably I could buy these and exercise immediately for a small profit of $50. Who would sell these? I don't understand selling deep in the money calls. Seems like giving away free money.

46,gpo6i09," Kinda, inside the bible it talks about two types of Christians, the faithful/prudent ones which do their duty and are rewarded by being raptured, and the foolish ones who do not do their duty. ""But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" for 1000 years. That's what happens to a Christian who believes but is unfaithful, while everyone else just goes to hell according to the bible.

There is a parable in the bible where a king gives some of his servants talents (gold coins) before he goes away on a journey. To one he gives 10 and that one invests them, so that when the king comes back he has 20 for the king. The same thing happens with the servant he gave 5 talents. The master is happy with them and gives them parts of his kingdom.

But the servant who he gave one talent only buried it in the ground, and when the king asks him about it he says:

&gt;Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.

but the king responded

&gt;You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

This is interpreted by the Christians which I know as the King (God) has given us all something, and if we fail and hide our faith, not preaching the gospel, we are failures.

There are other parables about this too, such of the trees. That which produces fruit is loved, but that which produces no fruit is cut down. The idea is the same, you are expected to do the lords will.",2,0,1614877257,Slipers

Are they actually going to change those necessary practices? Also, is going no code and not hiring programmers going to actually be good for the industry?
