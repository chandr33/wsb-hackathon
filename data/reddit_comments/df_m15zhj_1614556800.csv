3,gqbnruk,Honestly with everyone wanting to get out and do something I think holding on to amc might be the move. They are saying vaccinated people can start going soon. There’s hope for amc to make real money again. I’d leave my money there if I were you.,1,0,1615295542,whiskey-talks
4,gqbnsnf,Bruh honestly I thought about doing the same but I’m -70 total returns on amc and I know giving a year or less when the theaters are open that AMC should shoot back up. I feel like everyone bought it right under a fair value so I personally feel like there’s no harm in holding AMC. But you do you. Always.,1,0,1615295554,nicaden
5,gqbnvoc,It’s crazy to think it was 4 dollars not long ago in the whole timeline. The HDs really brought the price so low after all these years of shorting.,1,0,1615295604,nicaden
