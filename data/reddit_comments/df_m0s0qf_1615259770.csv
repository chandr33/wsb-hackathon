No one should be able to tell you what you can/cannot introduce into your body. Thats crazy. Not to mention statistics show thr war on drugs is a crock of shit, not to mention what kts done. All about propaganda, though.

You're wrong. Public perception of illegal drugs are much worse than their legal counterpart but society has not labelled them hard. They are just more accepting of legal vices purely because they are 'legal'. It wasn't long ago that alcohol was illegal yet people still got their fix. 

I'm all for decriminalisation and treating addicts as patients rather than criminals but if you are trying to say heroin/cocaine/methamphetamine are 'safer' than alcohol you're being incredibly disingenuous.

Saying none of these impair you like alcohol is a crock of shit. Take enough of a stimulant, you go into psychosis. Take enough of an opiate, you nod out and become a vegetable. Drink enough alcohol, your motor functions disappear.

You come off as an extremely biased and 'enlightened' drug enthusiast and to be honest, it seems you are no better than the people who look down on illegal drug users as scum of the earth. You're just on the other side of the coin... No offense but that's just my perception of you based on this interaction.",1,0,1615260967,HeLLRaYz0r

Or he‚Äôs emotionally unstable or something idk. Guy, if you read this, I would like to ask for you to reflect a bit on some of the comments which you are reacting strongly to. I‚Äôm a woman and it‚Äôs pretty offensive for you to say something is a ‚Äòwoman tier reply‚Äô and the point which people are trying to make is that it _is_ a little weird for you to describe your daughter how you have done in the post and in the comments.
