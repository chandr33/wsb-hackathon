1,gq67x0g,"There may have been a collective in the sense that people are talking. But everyone‚Äôs here for different if not similar reasons it seems to me. By and large the more people who have used this experience so far to get over that ‚Äústock market to complicated to even look into‚Äù barrier is a win unto itself. I‚Äôve wasted many years on the outside not really even looking in. ‚ÄúIf you have to ask, you can‚Äôt afford it‚Äù kinda thing I guess. Nothings a sure thing. But you can‚Äôt win if you don‚Äôt play so here I am. Holding my 10 shares strong.",1,0,1615173529,TwistGloomy
2,gq68337,"I do see the likelihood of an orchestrated squeeze that will shake out most paper hands. But at the end of the day the bill comes due for someone. And yes, it will be paid. At 10k per share even if all 70,000,000 were called we are still only talking about $70 billion dollars. Not even in trillion territory yet. And yes there are more than 70 million shares outstanding but some of those will be kicked further down the road. I think the money will be paid, Melvin and Chitadel file bankruptcy and/or get a bailout, market corrects bigly or collapses again. Life goes on.",1,0,1615173627,SPAClivesmatter

4,gq68f4i,"OP I get how you could think who would force them to buy at 25k, but the price being at 25k forces them to force themselves to pay and fast. The longer the shares are at 25k they would be losing insane amounts of money per day paying interest and it would make more sense for them to just buy the shares than hold on to the position at that point",1,0,1615173818,lbuck12

13,gq69hr3,"The tldr was efficient, but I actually enjoyed reading the whole thing. I never really understood the whole tldr thing anyway. If you're interested enough to read the tldr, why not read the supporting context? It costs nothing but a few minutes of our time and you might learn something new. If someone puts the time to write it all up, surely I can put the time to read it. Thanks for your input! üíéüëê",1,0,1615174439,Kungpooh11218
14,gq69kv7,"The ting with the rulez is,  there has to be someone to enforce those rules. If collapse of financial markets is imminent, if integrity of US institutions is in question across the world, they may bend the rules for what they perceive as 'greater good'. 

Clearing firms demanded 100% collateral on GME from Brokers when GME was actually about to squeeze. that's just one example from past.",1,0,1615174487,jassal1729

29,gq6cl4h,Whatever happens with GameStop. It‚Äôs just the beginning. An era where more people young and old alike can engage in a system that has just as much opportunity/failure to go around as existence itself. I‚Äôm 35 just getting into this and the ‚Äúfomo‚Äù thought of like ‚Äúif I had‚Äù is a gross feeling for sure. The broad spectrum of people talking/collaborating about tools of the trade makes me hopeful for the future as far as the ‚Äúblue collar/everyday person‚Äù getting into the market is concerned.,1,0,1615176236,TwistGloomy
