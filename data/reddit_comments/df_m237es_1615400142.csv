3,gqh3jb0,it's called hedging,1,0,1615400143,Kise93
4,gqh3jbl,"It could be many many  things here are a few possibilities:
1.It could be an actual sell off.  Retail got spooked by a downturn and decided to sell and lock in gains.  That triggered more price drop and more sell off.  Seems unlikely to me. Most sell offs don't start with upward momentum.  Usually see some downward momentum triangls form on the charts followed by a sell off.
2. An institutional investor could have jumped ship.  Could have happened, I havnt seen news on it, but it doesn't feel like that would be smart of them to me.
3. Short hedgefunds have been accumuing long shares over the last few days, artificially raising the price some percentage just for the purpose of dumping them, long with any shares they can borrow still, to trigger stop losses and try to shake out paper hands.
4. Maybe some trick long hedgfund borrowed a bunch of shares to intentionally get the stock on a distressed list for the next few days, and immediately buy then back bringing the price back up, but limiting short hedgefunds ability to fight for the call strikes expiring Friday.

There are countless other possibilities, I'm sure I'm not aware of most.",1,0,1615400143,lunar_tardigrade
