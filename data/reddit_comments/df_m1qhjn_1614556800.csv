67,gqfdvlu,"I was primarily referring to gross margin, but this does bring up a couple more points to make.

My original point was that the gross margin on pet supplies is in the 60-70% range.  The gross margin for computers / computer equipment is in the ~30-40% range.  

All other things being equal, this gives Chewy a higher future net.

Now, all other things are definitely not equal.  A major factor is the fact that GME has ~5,500 physical stores.  Each store has operational expenses (lease, utilities, etc.)  Chewy.com doesn't have that. 

The 64K question would be whether they can find a way to drive additional revenue at the physical locations that you **COULD NOT** simply do via on-line.   I'd say that currently the answer is **NO**.

The future case about converting them into in-person gaming havens is compelling; however, I've never been in a GameStop that would be large enough to have the floor space for this.  This would require **NEW** locations and additional capital outlay to build this out, etc.",1,0,1615365685,beyerch

Their real competition is with Microsoft and Sony, which ironically they already rely on to survive as a business. As these Xbox‚Äôs and PlayStation‚Äôs keep getting more and more storage(which they did with the new gen) the need for physical copies of games is going to almost entirely fizzle out. Microsoft and Sony already have marketplaces on the system to buy and download games just through the system. Long story short, I‚Äôm not bullish at all long term on GME.

89,gqfivfr,"They still make money if they buy the shares at $300 or $799.  The difference is that if they buy the shares to cover those $800 calls right now, they take so much volume out of the market that the price will absolutely go up to $800 or more.  Why would they push the price up themselves if they can avoid it and instead focus on just making pure profit from the sold calls for now?

You're viewing it too much as them losing money for not buying the shares now.  They're not losing anything.  They're making money.  They're playing this so that no matter what, they profit.  The only way they don't profit is if they can't get enough shares at the lower prices.
