7,gqhpaae,"Ok. Listen for some valuable insight. We like the stock (GME) which is why people are/were purchasing. It just so happens that it had short interest above 100% which caused/is causing huge volatility spikes in share price. It also so happens that GME as a company actually has potential.

Nokia on the other hand, has been trading at $3 - $6 for the better part of 5 years. Has barely any insiders holding it, less then 5% institutional investors and a short interest of 0.45%. Not to mention that they have 5.62B in shares outstanding. Do you like the stock? Then post DD and convince everyone. If you're trying to get people to jump on the bandwagon and pump a stock so you can profit, that's illegal. NOK has potential as a 5G juggernaut but it seems to be run by boomers who don't care about their stock.",2,0,1615409170,Jsand117
