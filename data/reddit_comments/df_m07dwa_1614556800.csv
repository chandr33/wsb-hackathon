5,gq6dxqw,"Intro: There's actually apps where you can trade in the stock market real time without using your own money. I'd do that first and once you get really comfortable start using your own money. 

Platforms: The more professional ones makes you deposit x amount of dollars to get started and theres Robinhood but I'm not going to even explain why or why you shouldn't use it.

Lingos: google or just lurk until you start catching on.

Good luck and happy trading

Not a professional advisor tho Soo I highly suggest googling binging or whatever search engine you use to get information. Books are a good way to learn or just watch wolf on Wall Street to get a crash course lol .. kidding
