5,gqfkgys,My move today is to drop more in GME. I only have $210 cleared to trade so i'll be dropping that. Setting a buy limit at $250 but if the patterned dip dosn't hit that price i'm fully prepared to buy in at $280,1,0,1615372023,JamesTrendall

38,gqfkizt,"Well I mean the stock is up 130% in a week, it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs normal movement without it being squeezed. A lot of that is probably just gamma squeeze, but shorts covering is 100% driving the price up. The stock moved up a ton yesterday on very little volume. Seems to me like    shorts are starting to get covered. Your right, 25% is still a lot (and that 60% reported is a really big outlier compared to what most places have reported) but the stock price was already at 200 then went to 1000. Percentage wise we already are that point going up nearly 7000 percent this year.",1,0,1615372079,p00nslaya69

When they mis-time the peak for the second time while I'm making money on both sides of it, we'll see who's laughing.

The unrealised gains from my shares (after adjusting stops as needed) go into getting more bear spreads.  For GME, I think bear spreads make far more sense than shorting shares, since deadline-timing the exit is going to be much easier (and less risky) than exact-timing the entrance.",1,0,1615372156,suur-siil
