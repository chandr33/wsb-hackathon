84,gqhy72h,"One of the most popular games out with a fuck load of micro transactions. Very replayable game as it's a sandbox game which means its entertainment is based on your imagination, which is the perfect 'kid' product. 

In a world where youth tends to gravitate towards just a handful of gaming titles, Roblox rising up (ree) and taking a huge market share with its pre-built IAP's is evident of an extremely successful game. It's only gained in popularity and could pose itself as a reasonable threat against Minecraft which has stagnated in it's new features. 

Look at the profit margins for a company like Epic Games and Fortnite. That game was generating billions of dollars a month just off in app purchases last I checked, and that was over a year ago. 

You may not 'get' it, but it is undoubtedly a successful game that has virtually no overhead cost relative to the profit it's taking in. 

RBLX can suffer in the same way tech in general has - over valued, mania, ect. But outside of that there isn't anything glaringly wrong with their long term model or short term business model.",6,0,1615413045,USFederalReserve
