51,gqb1bjz,"All the shares are sold, but a very large portion of those holding the shares have the price they are willing to let it go for... already queued.

In other words, say I personally own 100,000 shares, and I got in at $13.94. Maybe I saw the $483(ish) peak, got greedy, then was very remorseful for not taking some gains to buy tendies. This time around, again, even though all shares are sold, I am willing to start letting go of my 100,000 in increments, so I have a sell order out there for 10k shares @ $250, another 10k at $300, another 10k... etc.

So I had 100k, price hits $250, you want in, I sell you 500 at $250, another person buys 5k from me at $250, etc.

One of the few exceptions to this was Volkswagen. Porsche just basically bought it out and held as part of their strategy.

64,gqb6uo9,"Retail is the useful retards for the big money to slay it in GM3. You think half a billion dollars in five minutes that caused that giant green dildo was retail?

Retail is a pawn since so many are willing to hold thru vol that it reduces float and makes it easy to move either way for big money, and can amplify the trend up or down thru stops and fomo. 

Yes, a HF got caught with their pants down and turned into a shit show. It happened, and retail helped set it up, but even during the $480 run big money was running it up and also making money on the way down. Rinse and repeat. 

If you think for a moment that the smart money is not 100x more sophisticated and better positioned to extract tendies from this than 99.999% of everyone in this sub then ignorance is bliss. They can see more than we can see, they know more than we know, they can influence price action and market making. The bigger battle is taking place between the smart money on who can out maneuver who, and if they can vacuum money out of retail also that is gravy.
