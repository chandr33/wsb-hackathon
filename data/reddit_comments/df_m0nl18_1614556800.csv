15,gq8xi94,"I've been a lurker for a while, just follow to see what is getting talked about compared to other DD on my own and SKLZ is going to be very very good in 1...2...5 years. When motley fool issues a buy alert I generally jump on for some shares and it generally Pays off.

Not gonna twist your arm amd say buy before the rocket blasts off.... but it's a smart investment IMO",1,0,1615233307,CaptnZacSparrow

18,gq92mp9,"It‚Äôs pretty wild. There are public quotes from the head of gaming and esports at the NFL stating the new partnership in public PR releases. The Wolfpack research is just spam claiming ‚Äúwe were unable to find any references‚Äù to the partnership on the site, which actually isn‚Äôt true. And even so, they said the contest is launching Q2...it‚Äôs March. Things change, maybe something fell through that we don‚Äôt know about, not writing that off but the research is in poor form. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm personally holding and will consider adding to my position once the bleeding stops.",3,0,1615235525,Mchltschr
19,gq93m5t,"This company offers a nothing but a mobile gambling plugin.

80%+ of their revenue comes from 3 apps that they don't even own(A bingo app, a solitaire app, and a solitaire/blackjack hybrid).

The CEO, Andrew Paradise appears to have no experience in the gaming sector.

They bleed 10s of millions of dollars each month marketing for these three apps.

This company will fail spectacularly, it's quite literally a mobile bingo casino valued at nearly $10 billion.",1,0,1615235953,thehumanidiot

21,gq99cgb,I sold at $38 but I'm ready to get back in if the company addresses the obvious flaws in the short report. I think there is a lot of buying pressure waiting under $20.,2,0,1615238447,Jalepenish

31,gqbbljs,"How is it clueless though, they make 3 apps and spend millions in marketing with [Floyd Mayweather](https://investors.skillz.com/news/news-details/2020/Mayweather-to-Launch-Knockout-Tournament-Series-on-Skillz-Platform/default.aspx) and [Marshawn Lynch](https://gamingamericas.com/gambling-in-the-usa/2020/10/19/73074/marshawn-lynch-partners-with-mobile-esports-platform-skillz/) among other big name celebs in a market that is 80% older women. How many older women do we know that are interested in that type of marketing? 

They seem cool because they are the biggest name of their kind but they may be towards midtier in online skill cash gaming. 

I mean heck even in their own field there are other cash gaming experiences that offer a more enjoyable experience like [Celerx](https://celerx.app/) and [WorldWinner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/worldwinner-play-for-cash/id1248993106).  


Though I understand the recent movement to get behind gaming companies this company appears doesn't appear to be one chief.  I am interested to see their earnings tomorrow though.",1,0,1615286187,BradleyBowels
