19,gqhupdd,"In 1171, Enrico Dandolo, a Venetian envoy on an expedition to Byzantium (the capital of the Byzantine empire which was, incidentally, the rebranded Eastern Roman Empire), was blinded vindictively by the Emperor Manuel Comenenus due to ongoing tensions between Venice and Byzantium.

Enrico was not put out by the considerable setback, and continued on in his career as a statesman. He dedicated significant aid to the Fourth Crusade, which enabled them to succeed in sacking Byzantium in 1204, and Enrico and Venice became extremely wealthy(er) as a consequence.
