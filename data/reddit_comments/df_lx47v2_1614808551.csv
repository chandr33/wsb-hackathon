22,gpl1417,"I'm going to grab some more $WKHS. 

It's going to get a little political because that's what's going to drive this moving forward if it does move. 

The Post Master General is a hold over from the last administration as the current one can not fire him until they appoint a new board of directors to the U.S.P.S. 

That Post Master General unilaterally made the decision to award the new postal fleet contract to Oshkosh in defiance of a new executive order stating that all new federal vehicles would be electric. Likely the motive here was to lay landmines but that's besides the point. 

This executive order is great news for $WKHS and $GM and $F maybe even $TSLA if they can make a practical truck that doesn't look like something I drew in middle school. 

Anyway, it's very likely that the contract will be rescinded and awarded to WKHS unless Oshkosh can prove that they have the ability to make electric cars instead.

It's not a guarantee like anything but the price could move based on just the possibility that it could happen.",5,0,1614808573,Donkeyotee3

This has a market cap more than 1B so meets the subs min requirement

Its the highest traded share today on yahoo finance

Its moving on news that the vaccine they are marketing has better phase 3 results than JNJ and AZN and also handles mutant strains better than the mrna vaccines as it is an old style whole virus vaccine.

Plus options trading just started up on it so heavy buying of otm options can cause a gamma squeeze. Its also being heavily targetted by shorts

So it is the quintessential WSB stock. But any post with OCGN DD is getting removed
