4,gqi28eb,It’s overblown but it works. Cause the big boys rotate out and let the retailers panic sell. Then they cash in puts and buy back in.,2,0,1615414879,dahawmw

6,gqi39ju,"The 10 year auction was strong today. Foreign buyers can now enjoy decent yield pickup in USD-hedged carry trades. Barclays Agg just completed a -3.6% drawdown and the 30-yr treasury has just undergone it's largest drawdown since the 2008-2009 GFC.

Even if the CPI number today was fudged, the bond market to me appears oversold and in my opinion, the marginal buyers of UST alone (now foreign entities as well as US Fed Reserve) should allow yields across the curve to stabilize and perhaps fall a bit.

I am long 30-year UST futures.",1,0,1615415367,KernalHansLanda

10,gqi4ry7,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615416090,VisualMod
