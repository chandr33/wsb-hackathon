22,gpi6h8w,"Call options chains. It's kind of like a feedback loop. Options writers buy shares to cover ITM calls. The more shares they buy the higher the price goes, it makes more call options ITM, so they need to buy more shares and it can run wild. In the meantime the price runs up, shorts start cutting losses and buying up more shares. So now the price is flying with all this buying. Retail investors see this and start buying it too. This starts putting more calls ITM. It's like a runaway train. It's a feedback loop. 

The only way they stopped it the first time was by blocking buying shares at broker level. We are headed on a similar trajectory, but we have to see what they do when this happens again.",11,0,1614749613,WillSmiff

Fast forward to now, by calculating vwap using the high, low, close divided by 3 x volume for the period divided by volume for that period (using the whole trading day of today the 2nd) you get a vwap if $363.58.

Just need to know why I‚Äôm calculating it wrong. Or what‚Äôs wrong with investopedia‚Äôs calculation. Do you have a diff formula? I have nothing that calculates it for me. Can only look up vwap. It‚Äôs always a much higher price this way. Which would make sense if the volume/price reflects what it SHOULD be trading for vs what is trading for.
