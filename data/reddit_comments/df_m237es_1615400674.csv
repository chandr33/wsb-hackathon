Realistically, I'm selling at 500$. I dont see this stock staying on the 500 list for very long and I think it's reasonable to expect GME to sit in the 2-300s$ for the foreseeable future. If this peak ends up turning into a plateau, I'll cash out by the middle of the year.

81,gqh4x4x,I think it‚Äôs hilarious that the government makes you pay taxes on these earnings but they don‚Äôt have to go through any of the stress to watch the prices go up and down or the research it takes to properly invest. I understand tax brackets and those make sense if you ask me but to tax people for investing in the same way you guys make money is so wrong if you ask me. As if the government doesn‚Äôt have funds in prospects. If I took 20 dollars and turned it into 300 it should be my 300 dollars. That‚Äôs ridiculous they do halts and even still making it so hard to get ahead want a cut when or if you do get ahead. As if they didn‚Äôt already tax that money before we invested it several times.
