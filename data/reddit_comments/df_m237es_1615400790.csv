10 millions sold/bought 5 times is 50mill, 

50 mill being sold bought 1 time is also 50mill.

We had a day over 100million volume, which is more than the entire float. 

What you need to remember is if we hold more shares than shorts need to cover, its still good. 

If there is 30% of shorts to cover and we keep more than 70% someone doesnt have available shares to cover. 

Thats why we need to hold as they keep on shorting so they get cornered and we control the price.",2,0,1615400797,jfwelll
