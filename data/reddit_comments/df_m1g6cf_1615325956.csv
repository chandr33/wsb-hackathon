84,gqdkzyk,"Why worry, rkt has no up pressure, the little boosts it's had the last couple days were immediately deflated. It would be nice if it just dumps already, so people can just let it go. It had ONE good day and that's it, just like every other p&amp;d out there. Rkt tricked people and it sucks, but it trading sideways with these little DCB once a day is just robbing people of money. 

Already flipped some puts on the way down and made some dough, put about 10% into some more 21p and then the rest into GME that have since made me a grip of cash (unrealized)

That said, the few 3/12 21p(19.39) that I'm down on but I'm not sweating those, they can expire worthless and it will suck a little, would have been nice to make even more on rkt. 

If your rkt puts are 3/12 then maybe roll them to next week or two. Rkt may continue it's sideways trade for a bit.",2,0,1615326050,r6raff
