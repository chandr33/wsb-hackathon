9,gplpijw,"I lived in Colombia for 6 months and beer drinking is exploding down there. $ABEV owns Bogota Beer Company which has some of the best beer in Colombia and is rapidly growing. South America is one great place to be when it comes to beer, especially craft beer which is what they are getting into more.

26,gplz4ar,"Since Heineken got a contact for distribution in Brazil, stock prices have shit the bed. Hopefully it'll bounce back by summer but I wouldn't expect any big moves soon. It's rolling out this summer so I would imagine it staying low until people had a chance to feel out the competition. I got sucked into ABEV (25@ $2.71) like an idiot, thinking that with covid restrictions loosening up it would start to rocket but having major competition move in means slow gains at best. I plan on holding until fall or maybe right before Heineken's contract rolls out but best of luck to you all. I hope I'm wrong because nobody likes to lose, but it's important to do full DD, not just looking for what you want to see.",8,0,1614825925,Kn1ghtR1d3r87
27,gplzqn4,"Yes - related to options. As long as people are selling through Jan 2022, you can buy them. Principal costs tend to be calculated based on things like volatility and time to expiration. This is a casino so you can‚Äôt know for sure where it‚Äôll end up in 2022 (just make a strong educated guess based on DD). Enter low, SELL HIGH - rings true for both stocks and options. If you firmly believe it‚Äôs gonna trend upward over time, pick an entry point you‚Äôre comfortable with and get ready to ride it out through low points (or buy again to average down).

32,gpm3yit,"Hey! Thank you *so* much for all the info!  I started all this in early Feb due to - wait for it - $GME lol it's been a helluva ride so far and now that I've learned some indicators and technical analysis I'm dabbling into different stocks. Not too successfully but every trade has taught me a new lesson.

Options is my next go-to once I get better with trading. It seems super intimidating but also seems like everyone does it and it can be very profitable.  So thank you again for taking the time to explain this to me, much appreciated!

39,gpo3awm,"So here's what I don't get:

If alcohol sales have been booming during the pandemic, then why has its stock done so poorly, while others like SAM (side note: congrats to whoever bought this in 2020!), BUD, and even TAP (which is actually losing money) have all done better over the course of the pandemic? Why is ABEV going down with others are going up?

And if you're banking on the end of the pandemic boosting the price, why? It's implied that alcohol sales are booming because of the current situation; wouldn't you expect a decrease in alcohol sales once this is behind us? And if that's the case, then why would you expect declining revenue to boost the share price? Especially why would you expect it to *double* post-pandemic?",1,0,1614875885,Logpile98
