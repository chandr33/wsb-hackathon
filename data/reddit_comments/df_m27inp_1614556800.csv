4,gqhn78m,"Not related to the wicks but I wanted to point out for those who were worried that the volume on the buy back up was higher than on the drop, we’re still strong.",9,0,1615408294,A_Rats_Dick
5,gqhoz35,"(optimistically) what I've heard about volume means the price should fully correct if that's the case

I would really enjoy that considering I was +250% on a call I was about to paperhand just before the price started tanking... 395c for 3/12 bought at 12.006, which is fortunately still +7% but that will quickly decay if we don't see another spike",2,0,1615409038,immafivestarman

10,gqid6wf,"I’ve been curious about this too. If you refresh they go away for some reason. If you watch the time and sales, you’ll see those orders are getting filled through routes that you can’t even select on fidelity. If you had sell order on your share wouldn’t have sold on whatever buy order triggered the spike. For now I’ve been just classifying these as bogus but I’d like to know what’s going on.",1,0,1615420320,KyFly1
