I need you to understand that A) I've read all about their plans, B) I am aware of competitive gaming, and C) this is not going to produce profits immediately or, possibly, ever.  It is extremely speculative and might as well be a startup business.  There is no proof of concept at this point.  I like Ryan Cohen too but this is extremely ambitious.

Keep in mind Chewy is still not profitable despite a market cap 10x what Ryan Cohen sold it for a long time ago.  And Chewy loses less money, on less revenue, than gamestop's legacy business.",1,0,1615346543,OlyBomaye
