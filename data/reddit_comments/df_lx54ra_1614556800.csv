16,gpl3206,"That‚Äôs the crazy thing, I know avid golfers (that also invest in stocks) that had no idea this was happening. Once most the population finds out, to the fucking moon! I visited my first Top Golf 6 years ago and first thing I did was to see if they were publicly traded. They were not at the time.",1,0,1614809444,PatGbtch
17,gpl39a4,Curious when you think to buy in. Their earnings are on 5/6 and earnings are usually dangerous AF. You buying in before or after that?,3,0,1614809535,FalconGhost

22,gpl4fak,Lol noted. I will use Top Golf as excuse for getting drugged and robbed by hookers next time I‚Äôm in Vegas. Just another reason I like the stock.,3,0,1614810074,PatGbtch
23,gpl4zo4,This is dope. It seems like the merger news was out in October tho. I‚Äôm a little nervous it might have already factored that in,3,0,1614810335,FalconGhost
24,gpl5h3q,"I bought then and even bought more now.

1)Not everyone heard about it then. Got very little news coverage.
2) Isnt official till it‚Äôs voted on. Which is today.
3) Hasn‚Äôt gone up anywhere near the potential Top Golf adds.

31,gplkali,"""When the deal closes in early 2021, Callaway is expected to issue 88.039 million shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Topgolf excluding itself. The stock issuance is based upon a fixed price of $19.40 per share for Callaway stock - so Topgolf owners have already made a tidy return.""
