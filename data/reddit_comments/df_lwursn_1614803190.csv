That is a fair point. It's getting too damn tribal up in this.

I'm sick of all of the low effort posts for both GME and RKT. 

But I am fully capable of ignoring shit I don't want to read. 

The RKT play was legit, though who really gives a shit about Quicken loans? It's pretty hard to get Ape attention on something with zero emotional appeal ( get it? because it sounds like Peel, like a Banana? )  I missed RKT because I am tapped out.
