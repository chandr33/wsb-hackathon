8,gqeq2k8,"I'm beginning to believe that the hedgies are gonna let people get their rocks off until $500, hoping that everyone will just call it a day and sell. After $500 and we're heading in to tampering territory but with big, BIG gains if we push through. 

**Source:** I just thought of it just now.",3,0,1615347341,PJkazama
9,gqeq3yr,Possibly the run up is slower this time .. less volatile .. meaning less chance of a sudden demand for $3B at 4AM.,1,0,1615347364,lampstax
10,gqeq9du,They can’t do it again unless it goes to Pluto. Also the run up has been slow comparatively. Smart big money is on the train too. I would hate to be shorted this stock with naked shorts/calls because your competitors smell blood in the water. Consider too GME has bought time to restructure. The stars are aligning.,1,0,1615347453,Spangler77

14,gqeqm1g,"Everything about this go round seems different.  I feel like there's a whole 'nother ballgame going on this time, and while I've seen a few theories, I don't think we can know for sure what's going on.  It's extra hard to discern because there's little transparency and suspicion of some shenanigans (like HF's potentially shorting ETFs or HF's taking a long position).

Despite being a new trader, I fully understood and was convinced by the DD that was presented last month.  Now, I'm just not convinced we're looking at the same scenario for many reasons, one of which you highlighted.

I'm still holding, but I'm watching carefully.  Something just doesn't feel right.  Doesn't mean it won't moon, it just might be for different reasons than people think.",1,0,1615347657,ReduxAssassin
15,gqequvf,"IMHO, the big wigs are making money hand over fist whether it goes up or down.  the avg person and their 1, 10, 100, or even 1000 shares can't compare to the money these people are likely making. 

I agree with you, something is different this time.",2,0,1615347801,majorchamp
16,gqeqvxr,Oh the hedgies are definitely making a ton of money whether this thing goes up or down,2,0,1615347819,majorchamp

20,gqer4we,"I've wondered if they've changed their positions; that's why we're not seeing a lot of resistance on the way up.  Who knows though, nothing in this business is transparent.",3,0,1615347965,ReduxAssassin
21,gqercnq,"I agree about them making money.  Has no one noticed how we just seem to be flying by resistance points?  Last month, it was a constant talk of, ""uh oh, there's another giant sell wall, gotta push through it"".  Maybe I'm misremembering, but I'm not seeing that this time.",1,0,1615348089,ReduxAssassin
22,gqes86u,"Dude. You think RH doesn't have a program that estimates what their deposit requirement is likely to be? 
The NSCC updates them twice daily with deposit requirements. 

 The way they rigged this was by intentionally *waiting* till they were *forced* to increase the deposit. 
 
 That way they could *claim* they were forced. 

  CONVENIENTLY distracting everyone from the fact that they knew the deposit increase was coming, they were sent updated deposit requirements each day, and intentionally CHOSE to do nothing. 

 You see Apes.  Had they been proactive and updated their deposits  as advised by the NSCC in real time, then they wouldn't have been able to work out the deal they did with Citadel where they both stay in business and we got fucked.",1,0,1615348616,MarketDisturbance
