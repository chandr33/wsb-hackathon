3,gqb99ku,"Yeah someone was talking about that as a possibility yesterday. The only way I can think of that plan failing is if people remember the feeling of paper handing the first round and decide to hold on even tighter to spite the hedgies.

13,gqb9ghj,From DD that I have previously seen comparing this shit to VWAGY squeeze. we can pretty safely watch this climb about as high as we want and take about 80% of the peak when the actual squeeze happens up to a week or 2 after the fact.

56,gqbb1u4,"I think the funds have the ability to push back in a lull, which is what happened yesterday every time it took a breather.  The level 2 would show a flood of sells and buys in weird sized lots, like 23 shares, and it would be half the order book in those weird sizes.  That's definitely the funds.

What I think happens today is the paperhands jump off at open to cash in, but the FOMO of new people jumping in outweigh that by a lot.  I think we trip the breakers multiple times before lunch, maybe with a delayed re-start and they try to bore the autists into watching something else.  I don't think it works, but that's my prediction.  

I do think we have a pullback tomorrow after hitting $500 by eod today.  Many will cash in at least a few shares, but I don't think we peak until Friday or early next week.",1,0,1615285663,chiefoogabooga
