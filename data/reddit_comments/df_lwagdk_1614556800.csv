1,gpg6x62,"It’s really not that hard. Open an account with an online brokerage company like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade or alike. Then do research on companies you’re interested in, if you think the companies will do better year after year, then get the stock.

Also, WSB is more of a casino than a place for investing advice. Try r/investing instead and ask more questions. What I have said here is a simplification of the stock market for newbs, so if you really want to get deep into it, go over to r/investing",1,0,1614713825,TheGangstaGandalf
2,gpg7w67,"Go buy 1 share of a company that you use their product each day. You buy a COKE at lunch?  Do you use VERIZON for your phone sevice?

Male list of the things you eat, use for getting around in your world, and have consumed for the last 5 years. Make a list of 10 of these companies.

Purchase only 1 share each. Get the feeling of ownership. You want to visualize all the employees of those companies of getting up each morning going to work for you...the owner/share holder.

I am looking back from 3 decades of investing and that is what I wished someone would have told me years ago.

Next start reading, and listening, and learning.. You need to get the ""feeling"" of being the boss. Thinking like the owner. Gain the confidence of being in control.

All this other high tech thoughts will come later. But it will happen faster than you think. Good luck.",1,0,1614714245,DYTTIGAF
