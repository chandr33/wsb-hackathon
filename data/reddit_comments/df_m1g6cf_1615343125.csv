24,gqeik67,"Tomorrow is AMC earnings report. To be honest it'll also be the first day open in many states as well. Look for AMC to battle the incoming puts I imagine will come flying in but gain later in the day but I'm just an Ape; what do I know... 

One thing to consider, GME was never over 20 bucks that I can find; however AMC once traded 30-40 bucks for years...
(EDITED: HISTORICALS SHOW GME AT 30-45 2006-2016)

Lastly EYES is an amazing stock. Long ago they also traded for 90-190 bucks. They were cash flow negative for years till recently...
