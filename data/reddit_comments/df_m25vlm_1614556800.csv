6,gqhhbmt,"Aslo, if you try to sell at a peak and rebuy at the dip you caused, the stick market doesnt love you no more.

Your money has to settle so you sit in the naughty box for a day or two.

14,gqhnsgm,I think he is saying hedgies got some paper handers on the price drop. Remember a lot of people bought at 300+ and wanted to escape the chaos. Im not gonna hate on those people. This war isn't for everyone. They just wanted a free ride to the moon didnt put in the work to investigate GME. At the end of the day they just have a different financial plan and goals.,4,0,1615408539,ChErRyPOPPINSaf
