23,gqg66pq,"To short something you borrow it and sell it immediately for cash.
Then you wait until the price tanks to buy back and returne what was borrowed.
The price difference is yours to keep.
Now selling borrowed stocks increase supply thus price go down.
Paper hands🧻 see price go down and panic sell.
Price go down further triggering more sells.
