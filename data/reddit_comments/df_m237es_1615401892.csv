Now platforms have pretty much said buy whatever so we're just getting stoppages when there's a huge change (in either direction). People can react and there's effectively blood in the water again after that first bounce back and the huge high-end price today so I agree.   


Plus I'm guessing some people took profit and are looking to get back in. I don't see this crashing to 40 again any time soon.",3,0,1615401897,Teripid
