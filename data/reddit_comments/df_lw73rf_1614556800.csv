0,gpfmrs2,No clue.... but what I will say is that government very rarely accurately executes on behalf of the people itâ€™s supposed to represent. Not to mention the entire administration is buddy buddy with decades old financial institutions.,4,0,1614705152,Dalibongo
1,gpfn5mm,Yeah. Janet Yellen creeps me out and I only know a bit about her. I'm glad that orange fucks Cheeto fingers are off the big red button but Bidens suspect at best.,1,0,1614705320,Exo357

9,gpfox73,"upper 10%?  I don't know if you know the ones we really need to look into are the 0.00001% if you make like 100k you are considered like the upper 10%. What we really need is for every members of Congress have term limits similar to the Presidency. We can't have people who never had a job making a career out of making legislations they know nothing about. We need to keep them accountable and these are public servants they should not be making $150k+/year and every member of the Congress should have their financials audited by independent firms to see where they are getting their ""extra"" fundings. Similar to accountants having to keep independence to their clients by not being able to hold finance interest with companies that their firms work for. The government should have full disclosure of their financials and should not have friendly relationship with CEOs and companies they are making laws for.",1,0,1614706087,Jealous_Object4137

11,gpfujs6,"I'm talking net worth. The top 30% have a net worth of over $250,000 so your number seems low. Top 10% have a net worth of at least $500,000 (2019 census). Regardless, yes, the disproportionate distribution of wealth is out of control. I think you are going off topic a bit though. The thread is about Gary  Gensler and whether anyone knows anything about him specifically. We can assume he's one of the assholes you are talking about but I'd rather not assume",1,0,1614708541,Exo357

13,gpfww6c,"Wealth disproportionate is not the problem but the ability for an individual to move in and out of a wealth bracket is and it all starts from the government and their legislations. Also, that's it $250k is not a lot for a household. People are so fixated in just the flat gross income that they fail to see the whole picture. We don't count for the taxes which will take approx 35-40% and not accounting for maybe the debt incurr to generate that revenue and etc. But yea I guess I am way off topic now but I gues what I am trying to say is doesn't matter if its gary, jerry, or whoever because the current political structure is designed to keep people poor.",1,0,1614709553,Jealous_Object4137
14,gpg1hou,Great. Wonderful. A+. Your senior thesis still doesn't belong in this thread at your own admittance. Thanks for sharing. ðŸ™„,1,0,1614711510,Exo357
15,gpge0gq,"Not sure if you are being sarcastic about it or not but at least one advice is your definition of wealth needs to be redefine. If you think top 30% is the problem you are sadly mistaken and believe the ""disproportionate distribution of wealth"" applies to the 30%. If you go outside of your wiki you will understand the 29% of the top 30% are more typically a moving ladder and the majority of the wealth are in the top 1.0%. Fyi I work in wall street and from my experience it doesn't matter who's in charge all they will hand out is just few fines and a slap on the wrist.",0,0,1614716877,Jealous_Object4137
