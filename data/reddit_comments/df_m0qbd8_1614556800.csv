The thing I don't get is, why should the stock price be higher post covid vs where it was at pre-covid? Asides for expanding snacking services and alcohol bevrages and the AMC moviepass program whatever it's called. I don't know why AMC should get so much profit the stocks should be anything more than maybe 3x vs what they were in say 2016 or 2017.


Note: I have 12 AMC shares and bought in at 14.28 each. currently at -59.88/34.95% loss on it. the money I used was purely screwing around money so while the loss did sting I was never, ever going to sell it and actualize the loss. I'll take 100% loss but not a percent less.

also I missed riding rollercoasters and this was the next best thing.",1,0,1615262425,Fire2box
68,gqanxuf,"Thanks for the post.  I understand your point.  Just a few things to consider:

1.  Pent up demand.  We have all been stuck at home for about a year now.
2. There are a ton of new releases, some that are blockbusters, that they have been waiting to release, post-covid.
3. They have renegotiated a significant a number of leases and along with other expense reductions have cut over $1B in expenses.
4. The CEO is very sharp and experienced and I'm ""hopeful"" that they are re-imagining the company's structure, model and even its scope going forward.",1,0,1615265481,EZYPZY100

serving alcohol that being mixed drinks or just bottles/mugs of beer, ale, cider, glasses of wine, etc at theaters is a great idea though. Hopefully they expand to easy and good pub food too.",2,0,1615265884,Fire2box

81,gqcckn6,"AMC will release earnings tomorrow.  **DO NOT** get caught up on the huge EPS loss or even if they miss estimates.  This is all ridiculously irrelevant.  They have literally been closed for the last year!

What is important is what they look like moving forward:

* How much cash they raised and the CEO's sentiment that they will not need to raise more through issuing more shares (dilution).
* How much go forward expense has been reduced through lease re-negotiations and other expense reduction initiatives.
* How many of their theatres are now open and when they expect to open the rest.  I believe it's 90% in the U.S. right now.
* Sentiment on pent up demand and the impact of all the movies that Hollywood has been holding to release post-covid.
* How they have adjusted their model to be more productive and efficient.

These things will give us a good feel for the long term, regardless of the good momentum and possible squeeze in the short term.
