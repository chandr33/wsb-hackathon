11,gq9c25c,its called a funnel approach to research I was looking for like an article or post that has as much info as possible then you got in and get the missing details. If the info is already out there theres no need for me to recreate it.,0,0,1615239656,jwslyhardin

15,gq9cio3,"the mods arent oppressive. If you see this mods, i think youre sick. I was saying the posting rules are a bit oppressive which is true if you look at the kinds of stuff that was posted and not removed a year ago.

17,gq9e013,"first of all im a WSB member therefore im retarded. Second of all i was just hoping someone knew of an article that had a timeline of events to supplement my own research.

Edit: to be clear though when i am telling the story of $GME in the paper 99% of that section will be citing reddit and other social media because that's where the events took place.",0,0,1615240542,jwslyhardin
18,gq9elo7,Good luck with your studies and research.  But trying to dig information on a fellow redditer sounds like a hedgie trying to get information.  Suspect AF.,2,0,1615240813,Fair_Adhesiveness849
19,gq9fc1w,i appreciate it and i wasn't really expecting anything by posting this but it takes 2 mins to write a post so any info that i could have gotten that i didnt already have would have been worth it.,0,0,1615241153,jwslyhardin
