I've based my question on what I see on the screenshot - if he has 5 million, I'd genuinely be interested to know why he doesn't retire and live a happy life, rather than stressing over losing a million and potential future losses.",2,0,1614885634,LiberLilith

33,gposo2n,"Right he posted something and mentioned being worried about a margin call. So you know a significant portion is margin. Enough that he‚Äôs worried they‚Äôre gonna sell his assets to pay his debt. 
And yes they‚Äôll give people 4 mil in margin. They‚Äôll give a billion in margin, as long as you have collateral. 
Most brokerages will give you atleast 2x what you have in cash. So if he has 2 million and got 4 via margin, he‚Äôs lost most of his money. 
And the reason he doesn‚Äôt retire and live a happy life if because he‚Äôs a gambling addict disguised as a trader. Like most people on wsb",4,0,1614886577,Throwaway1262020
