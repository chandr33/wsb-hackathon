1,gpm08t2,Because your broker is going to tell the IRS and send them and you a tax form called a 1099. Short term gains are those held for less than year. Long term gains are for positions held for over a year. The time is measured from the day bought to the day sold. Your tax rate will depend on your income tax bracket. You will pay tax.,1,0,1614826485,WSBetty

15,gpm10pk,"Regarding verticals, point taken. What percentage would you guess are verticals? I don't have a ton of experience with this and would be curious to know what proportion of calls one might expect to be verticals. With a volatile stock like this, I'm also curious what effect that might have on this scenario.

Regarding gamma, I don't agree. Here is a [source](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/gamma.aspx) to show gamma increasing around the strike price. The rate of increase can be higher or lower depending on volatility, but gamma is higher around the strike price (it doesn't seem like it would ever be able to smooth out completely in practice).",5,0,1614826881,critter_bus

28,gpm1iqt,"I heard Uncle Bruce this morning as well.  Looking at the Russell website, it seems as if this change doesn't occur till June ([https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution)) .   That said, Gamestop is already on the Russell 3000 ([https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/support\_document/RU3000\_MembershipList\_20190701.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/support_document/RU3000_MembershipList_20190701.pdf)), thus already embedded in a number of ETF's.  Question is, how many *more* ***Russell 2000 indexes*** *are there than* ***Russell 3000 indexes?*** 

In my 5 minutes of Google Searching, I cannot answer that question, but unless the volume of funds that track the 2000 or even 1000 is exponentially larger than the funds that track the 3000, there wont be much ***more*** demand than there already is in the market for this security.

That's not financial analysis, just a few minutes googling around.  Hopefully I'm wrong on all fronts and volume/price blow thru the roof and we can both laugh at my pitiful insight shared on this board as we pay off the CC's used to buy these precious shares.",45,0,1614827140,Apprehensive-Bed5241

73,gpm3l6a,"The thought is that as options move into the money, that would require hedging. At the money, you'd need approximately 1/2 the shares long to delta hedge (equal-ish probability of an up or down movement). As it moves into the money, the rate of delta increase is higher near the money and gets smaller as it moves farther away (into or out of the money). 

I'd recommend taking a look at this [calculator](https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/optionscalculator). Play around with it a bit and try changing the prices around the strike prices. 

So, I'd agree that at current prices, the $800's have a low delta, but at each incremental strike price $125, $130, etc. this battle is being fought. As any given strike moves into the money the delta for that particular strike price would increase. If $800 were to happen, that would be something...",5,0,1614828198,critter_bus
