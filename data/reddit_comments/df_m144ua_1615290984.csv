29,gqbh43w,"Dude this is wishful thinking at best. 

&gt;	Plus how many millions still want physical Games?

Apparently not enough to stop GameStop from hemorrhaging money.

&gt;	e-books didn't destroy physical books and neither will downloadable Games destroy physical copies

E books didn‚Äôt destroy physical books because books are free or cheap. You can go to the library and get any book you want. 

If you‚Äôre asking if e books have impacted brick and mortar book stores though, the answer is a lot. Barnes and noble has stated multiple times that it won‚Äôt do business or associate with Amazon because of the impact that kindle has had on the book market. They have had negative earnings for seven years in a row now.

What‚Äôs your justification for how people will all of a sudden want physical games again when 1.) they often cost more, and 2.) you have to go out to and actual store and buy it, as opposed to having it instantly.",1,0,1615291031,BBBBrendan182
