22,gqfr47e,"Thank you. I hope this is a life-changer for us all. 

I was talking to my dad on Monday about WSB and how my meager investment has increased because of what I've learned here. He doesn't trade, just coasts on the Allstate and Discover stock he got from the profit-sharing program at Sears.

It wasn't THAT long ago that a department store salesman could buy a house, raise 2 kids, and save enough for a reasonably comfortable retirement.",1,0,1615377903,Jef_Wheaton
23,gqfsf3i,"It's wild how much you learn, and how rapidly, when you put skin in the game. It's why real-world experience is valued higher than college experience, in most cases. Still go to college, hang out with people your age, fuck a bunch of hotties. But don't trust that a degree will magically get you some 80k job where you're on easy street, it's a sad joke. You will always be better off betting on yourself, betting on what you think is right. Either you win, or you learn. But betting on someone else to carve your path for you, that just makes you a mark.",1,0,1615378877,GroundhogExpert
