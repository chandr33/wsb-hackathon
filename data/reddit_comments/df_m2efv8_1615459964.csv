And to see it go up, day after day, steadily but surely (don't call me shirley) made me ecstatic of course. I mean, doubling my investment was really something.   


  
And I can't deny I've been tempted to day trade this, and did try a couple times, always getting back in with no loss, but no real gain. It is hard to just WATCH.  


  
And when at 340 I felt like "" i might sell for this sweet gain and get back in if it dips a bit"" and I saw it halted.  


  
And then at 300.

I have always been drawn to gambling and even when I was earning ¬£20k a year I'd routinely find myself with ¬£10k, which represented everything I had each time, on black at the roulette table. Have never won with ¬£10k on the table.

Wasn't hard for me to hold as this stock business, well, it's fun but it doesn't seem to completely wipe you out when you lose. The fact that it looked like an intentional rigging of the game just made me dig my heels in.

27,gqkbder,"I got into this knowing as much as Jon Snow.  I had every intention on getting into stocks specifically I wanted a portfolio of positions on AMD TSM NVDA UMC, I wanted to go all in long on silicon manufacturers for starters.  Even my IRA was holding ETF called FTEC spread across the same sectors.  I bought 1 @ 95 end of Jan after squeeze 1.  That and 2x AMD was my entry into the market.  It's important to state I'm paying off a huge chunk of debt this month and I'm disciplined on that goal, taxes came back, both fed and state went immediately to the debt both checks.  The upcoming stimmie will do the same.  So in here with my limited $400 play money I skimmed off non market investments.  I watched my GME stalemate at $40 and paper handed.  That decision I regretted while doing it but not a few days later, I realized I had to revert that mistake and wash sell'd myself back in 1 share for $135.  Days later i upped my position averaging down with a single share but at $120.  Just days ago I sold off my FTEC at a minimal loss, it had been rising very slowly after tanking so it cost me about $3 to exit the position and land another GME share with the rest going bullish into VGAC. 

Cut to yesterday's big dipper event, by this time I was mentally prepared.  I had done tons of market research outside of reddit, I've read many DD post inside of reddit, and i realized the side the media was on and knew they were begging us to let them be.  So just seconds after my buddy holding bags at a 300+average messages me and says we came back for him boom.  In my timezone we're talking 11:45am.  I was walking out the door for lunch in 5 minutes.  I looked, I laughed, I closed active trader pro, and I loaded up uncle Bruce on my cell to listen in my car while I drove to lunch confident this was artificial.  One key point I heard a few times during my market research was an artificial movement in stock almost always rebounds in the opposite direction but to a slightly higher degree (albeit artificial in the context of those in learning from usually means a stark movement without the volume to match).

I'm a tiny bag holder but I was proud of my damn self for not even attempting to load up a sell tab on active trader pro at $180 to protect myself from total loss. I laughed it off knowing we'd swallow the dip like a porn star and enjoyed my lunch.",1,0,1615463674,dreamsforgotten
