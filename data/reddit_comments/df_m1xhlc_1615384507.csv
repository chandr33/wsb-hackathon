18,gqg1gl1,"oversimplified ELI5 explanation

Hedge funds thought the stock would go down. They BORROWED shares, and sold them at say $10. Now the price is going up, and they need to buy at much higher prices, say $280, incurring a $270 loss (-2700% return), in order to return the shares to where they borrowed them from.

They are using all the influence they have to make this stock go down, but apes are still holding, thanks to this subreddit 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍 and plenty of whales 

HFs pay rent every day for the shares they borrowed (which is very expensive for several reasons), so at a certain point they will have to decide to cut their losses, buy shares in order to return them (‘cover their short’). Buying the shares will increase the share price, which will force other shorters to do the same, driving the price to insane heights, rather fast. This is what you call a short squeeze. It is very likely to occur since there are A LOT of short sellers, I’ve heard speculations between 30% and much higher than 140%; any of these numbers has the potential to turn this into the greatest short squeeze in history, a NYSE supernova if you will. 🚀💫🚀💫🚀💫🚀💫🚀💫 Also factors like a gamma squeeze may accelerate this, but thats harder to explain.

This is not financial advice, but it may be worth buying whatever small amount of GME shares you can afford to lose, and enjoy the ride/show without fearing volatility. It’s important for the amount you invest to be affordable, so that you can confidently resist all types of legal and illegal attacks and tricks from HFs and media. 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌
