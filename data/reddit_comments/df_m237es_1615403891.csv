94,gqhcxpj,"The drop from $343 to $198 in like 5min got me thinking for a moment that Melvin (or whoever) would continue doing whatever they did to cause such a massive drop and the stock would drop back to double digits.

So I figured if I could sell on the way down *this time*, then buy back at double-digits and go from 2 shares to 3, 4, 5+ shares?! Ooof. I didn't want to miss that chance.

Like r/Netnicolas mentioned in their post though: ""Most who play \[that\] game loses. It's very hard to predict the highs and the lows...""

I tried to predict the low was going to be a lot lower followed by a massive rocket back up. I was wrong about how much lower it was going to go and lost because of it.
