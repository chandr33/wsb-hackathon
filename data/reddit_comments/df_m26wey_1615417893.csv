0,gqi8m3o,"Yeah, I was watching as the market ticker had froze but the sell/buy bids kept showing lots of activity.... then everything froze. I thought my app crashed so I refresh a couple times (new ape, didn't know about trading halts yet) and then when it updates again it was down to 202 (I never even saw the &lt;200 buy option)  


\-$150 in a minute. Holy Fuck.  


Another trade halt triggered lol.

46,gqjyqce,"You need to consider supply and demand. At the share volume that you and I sell at, supply and demand is completely irrelevant, so it’s hard to see. You want to sell 5 iPhones for $500? Good, I want to buy 5 iPhones for $500. We’re happy, we’re done. 

But say you want to sell 750,000 iPhones. You’re saying just sell them, what’s the big deal? Well the big deal is that you’re not going to just get someone to pay you $75,000,000 the same way I paid you the 5 for $500. You may get a few more buyers like me, but pretty soon the next guy in line is going to offer you $450, and you’re not really in position to say no when you still have 749,000 phones to sell off. Then the next guy offers you $400 etc... pretty you’ve fucked yourself bc you still have 500,000 phones to sell and you realize each next person in line is just nickel and diming you from the last guy’s price... ain’t nobody coming around offering you 5x500 anymore.
