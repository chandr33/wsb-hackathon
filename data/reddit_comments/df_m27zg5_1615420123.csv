82,gqid6br,"I don't know what to say to you here, man. I've been seeing MarketWatch in my news feeds on my trading platforms for almost a decade now. They are constantly, sometimes rapidly updating their articles as the market changes. The post that we are arguing about here clearly has ""UPDATE:"" in the header. Is it so hard to believe that they made the post, the market tanked, and then they updated it because it was no longer even relevant?  


To me, that seems like the most likely explanation. On the other hand, I guess you can ignore all of that, as is your right, and just claim that MarketWatch was bought out and put out this hit piece to tank Gamestop (not to mention all of the other meme stock at the same time). I really don't think MarketWatch is that important of a publication to have that kind of clout in the markets.
