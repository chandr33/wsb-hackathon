Just like cigarette was cool and everywhere and now is getting erradicated after they calculated it costs more in healthcare than it pays in taxes, if we were to see a trend in the rise of some mental issues or else thats related to weed consumption, it could reverse the industry in the long long run. 

I hope not because i think weed is not as a regular consumption than cigarettes but as much as it is cool and trending now, I can see a possible downfall at some point. It will take many years before we see the long term effect on such big masses. Same goes with vape. Well even worse as its new but the raise in weed consumption could also harm the mental health of many younger smokers.",2,0,1615342655,jfwelll
