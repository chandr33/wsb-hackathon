I honestly believe Hollywood wants the box offices open, really helps pay off their production costs.

67,gq8ulda,"honestly this month im waiting to hear how godzilla vs kong will do

its the first big blockbuster ppl want to see after 1 fking year

godzilla you want to watch in a cinema

with all the other cinemas dying cuz of covid means less competition also

ppl like me are starving for a big screen experience, i can only imagine how this will look on paper

ppl want in but only 25% volume, meaning it should stretch the time where they are officially full

say normally the first 1-2 weeks the movie is full, with this they could maybe have a full month each weekend where every room is filled to its max ( 25%)

&amp;#x200B;

officially that will sound pretty fking good i WOULD think

i honestly do think amc might make a big boy jump if everything keeps going

&amp;#x200B;

also remember alot of ppl can only go once, and godzilla will be that once with the family, so right now they wont go to the movies, theyll wait 

then later mortal kombat will release like what 5 days later or so

2 different audiences, ill hold this shit at least until godzilla  releases

if the numbers make it then they will have a short moment of ppl hungering for the cinema experience after 1 year of nothing",1,0,1615232049,Irarius
