That last hour was crazy.",0,0,1615237369,CaptainSchiel
2,gq9aepb,"Yeah I'm sure a lot of bears did great.

I was willing to risk scalping and buy if it surged or at the end of the day. They told me option buying lockout is till Wed and that what killed the whole play. Only hope is I can buy in tommorow morning if it DD looks good and options settling might do something to let me buy. I'm pretty sure they didn't know what was actually going on with the app.

Yolod on GE stock though and made like $3 lmao.",1,0,1615238916,Blanket-presence

5,gqrb9ny,Soo is there gonna be some sweet loss porn from you on this? Was really hoping DASH was gonna depreciate as I think it's too overvalued.,1,0,1615601227,Ph0enixF0x
6,gqrn7u4,"Yeah, it’s actually super unexciting. I bet like 10k and pretty much broke even (+$500). Still have no idea how 4MM shares get dumped in 30 minutes and the prices goes up 8%, but w/e.

I was up $15k profit at one point, then lost it. Should I make a post for that to prevent a ban lol?",1,0,1615608353,Mister_Twiggy
