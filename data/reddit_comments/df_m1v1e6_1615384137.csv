0,gqg0r5i,"Do you retards not realise that hedge funds control the narrative? You think its a coicidence that all the retard media houses have been waffling on about CPI, Inflation, 10 year yields, Tech bubble etc?? No.. 

They do it because the hedgies feed them 'inside' information to mislead the public into panic selling - then when things drop they clean up the cheap shares from all those with paper hands. Rinse repeat - create the narrative - program the algo and enjoy the tendies. The only thing they can't control is GME because we run",1,0,1615384139,BorisYeltzen

we will never see inflation

the inflation calculation is basically set up so that it never really goes up

if something like housing is hyperinflating, just remove it from the calculation or tweak it in a way so that it doesn't affect inflation calculation, they can do it with anything

  CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ‚Äì FEBRUARY 2021    The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent   in February on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in January,   the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,   the all items index increased 1.7 percent before seasonal adjustment.    The gasoline index continued to increase, rising 6.4 percent in February and   accounting for over half of the seasonally adjusted increase in the all items   index. The electricity and natural gas indexes also increased, and the energy   index rose 3.9 percent over the month. The food index rose 0.2 percent in   February, with the index for food at home and the index for food away from   home both rising.     The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in February.   The indexes for shelter, recreation, medical care, and motor vehicle insurance   all increased over the month. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and   trucks, and apparel all declined in February.     The all items index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending February, a   larger increase than the 1.4-percent reported for the period ending in January.   The index for all items less food and energy rose 1.3 percent over the last 12   months, a smaller increase than the 1.4-percent rise for the 12 months ending   January. The food index rose 3.6 percent over the last 12 months, while the   energy index increased 2.4 percent over that period.",1,0,1615384193,ruck_my_life
