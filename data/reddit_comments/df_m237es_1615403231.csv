1,gqhb9wm,"Some people have a number where things just don‚Äôt make sense anymore. Apparently my number is about 10K. Like if I sell at a point I make 10K profit, if it were to double I‚Äôd get 20K but in my mind they‚Äôre the same number while 5K and 10K seem so far apart even though 10k and 20k are a bigger difference.

6,gqhb9wx,"&gt;I played that about as dumb as I can possibly imagine.

I can imagine dumber. Like taking 5k off a credit line to jam into GME @ 300, then choked the fuck up when it crashed and ended up trying to recoup by selling at 50.   
Now who looks like a damn fool.

7,gqhba25,"No idea, but my initial guess on that is something along the lines of, when the price tanks their customer support reps probably field many many many complaints blaming them for not telling people!!!! When the price moons, people either get their tendies and chill, or they miss it but feel like it's their fault.  


Obviously it's not their fault that people don't catch crashes, but you can bet your ass people will complain to them and try to absolve themselves of responsibility for anything.",2,0,1615403234,EvlSteveDave
