1,gq8h6rk,No one is going to tell you what to do. I spent all the money I am willing to lose 2 weeks ago and held. With the new SEC rules and everything else. If I had more money to buy. I would. That said I would go in with the expectation to hold for a while.,6,0,1615226290,Ditto_D

10,gq8hr83,not a problem. Just remember it is 100% on you to manage potential losses. So I would say treat every red cent as if you will absolutely never get it back.,2,0,1615226537,Ditto_D
11,gq8jovb,"Thanks will do, do you recommend any sites to help track? Was trying to find something where I can view my stocks quickly and have running in a tab 24/7",1,0,1615227360,williegpks
12,gq8k5oy,"I trade with Fidelity and use their Active Trader Pro application on desktop. I installed and created a robinhood account cause their phone app is pretty clean for just taking a quick look at what is going on in the day. 

The Fidelity app sucks dick, but is good enough to get in or out of a position if needed on the go. 

Others will probably recommend better tools, but this is what I work with.",2,0,1615227561,Ditto_D
