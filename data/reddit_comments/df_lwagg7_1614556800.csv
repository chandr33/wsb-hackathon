12,gpg98me,"Trust me I did GME when they first did it and got at 30 and sold at 400 right before it dropped but it won’t happen again.  Why not buy a stock that has almost 1 billion cash that you know can buy any company and yes has a lot of shares but has the possibility to go higher and isn’t expensive. Let say you buy 1000 of them and it goes up by 5$ you make 5,000. To buy 1000 of GME you will need to spend a lot of money. To make this go up by 5$ is easy if everyone buys and holds. GME can go up buy who there can afford 1000 shares of GME. ?",1,0,1614714826,Davemg1983
13,gpg9ecl,"Haha no. I bought at 1.05 with 300,000 shares with my profits from GME and amc. Bought amc when it was 8 and sold at 19. I got GME at around 30 and sold at 400 before it dropped so made a fortune.",1,0,1614714893,Davemg1983
14,gpg9kns,"Then why wouldn’t I run out now. I got 300,000 shares at 1.05 with my profits from  GME and amc .  Just stating a fact that GME won’t go to 400 again and everyone knows it. If you think it will then your a bag holder or a dreamer.",1,0,1614714966,Davemg1983
15,gpg9yt0,I was just stating a fact of why buy a stock that can’t reach 400 again. I was in the first batch and sold at 400. I did amc and GME. There isn’t the short amount. Yes it got to 120 and maybe alittle more but for people to think it will go to 400. Common.,1,0,1614715133,Davemg1983

17,gpgbnka,Hahaha ok. I guess diamonds hands will be holding forever because no major company is shorting it. It’s raising because people are buying it and small squeezes. No short squeeze or it would of jumped and kept going. But we will see. Hope it does go.,1,0,1614715863,Davemg1983

They really need to start paying better shills, cos this is just pathetic! We know the volume of shorts TODAY you FUD cruising thunder wallop!",1,0,1614716094,2tHeMooN69000
19,gpgcj0d,So I guess the shorts are kicking your butts. Since it went from 50 to 170 back to 120. Dude I own this stock also. I have 200 of them. Bought last week. I want it to go up. I know it won’t go to 400 but I want it to go up. I was just saying that sndl had potential but if you don’t go anything smart to say since you can’t spell then don’t say anything.,1,0,1614716242,Davemg1983
