1,gpp9j8f,Soooo instead of giving you money rkt is keeping it to themselves? Sounds good to me,2,0,1614893691,RagingHippo33469
2,gpp9jnz,Sounds like you want to be paid for what a computer can do.,21,0,1614893696,BaptismsForHarambe
3,gpp9o82,"Bullshit

RKT list all of the local mortgage lenders on their site for free. People can literally use RKT website to find and use a different lender. And if RKT is driving business to you, they donâ€™t even charge you for it. At least for now.

9,gppacyy,"Summary of OP's post:

Sometimes I make money. When I don't I like to whine and complain about it because well it's me. Everyone should care. I also shave my hands everyday and enjoy sleeping underneath the deck while my wife gets stuffed by her boyfriend's massive RKT.",1,0,1614894051,CommieMachineLove

Note: This isnt sarcastic joke, Iâ€™ve seen models built that correct humans on loan forms processed. You think itâ€™s machines making the mistakes, but itâ€™s the other way around",-2,0,1614894143,Farmer_eh

18,gppc6fp,"Bob Slydell : What you do at Initech is you take the specifications from the customer and bring them down to the software engineers?

Tom Smykowski : Yes, yes that's right.

Bob Porter : Well then I just have to ask why can't the customers take them directly to the software people?

Tom Smykowski : Well, I'll tell you why, because, engineers are not good at dealing with customers.

Bob Slydell : So you physically take the specs from the customer?

Tom Smykowski : Well... No. My secretary does that, or they're faxed.

Bob Porter : So then you must physically bring them to the software people?

Tom Smykowski : Well. No. Ah sometimes.

Bob Slydell : What would you say you do here?


OP is Tom.",5,0,1614894851,Rrrrandle
19,gppcrux,"Yeah definitely not the case.. humans are absolutely needed for complete a loan file. RKTâ€™s model along with some other companies like owning.com only want cookie cutter W2 employee, 1 property (primary res), $300k loan with low LTV. They have lower overhead because they use technology to help them complete the easy loans and compress margins so thin that the LO you work with gets paid shit (talking about their retail channel). Thatâ€™s not gonna work for a lot of the country.",3,0,1614895115,justalurkerpassingby
