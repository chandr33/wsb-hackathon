5,gqfub3k,I didn‚Äôt lol it got downvoted ASAP and removed by the automod,1,0,1615380208,tugjobterry
6,gqfuimx,"Lol yeah it got deleted in front of me.. anyway, hopefully no one in here who makes money does anything like Martin skrelli did. Medication should be free",1,0,1615380354,mrbl0onde
7,gqfv04n,"Well they‚Äôre never gonna be free tbh. The average drug that makes it to market costs $1 billion to make with R&amp;D, etc. So you‚Äôll either be paying for new medication through higher taxes or you won‚Äôt be producing any more drugs and therapies ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But martin‚Äôs companies did gut R&amp;D tho so I‚Äôll extend an olive branch and say that wasn‚Äôt very cash money of him",1,0,1615380689,tugjobterry
8,gqfvdlx,"Lol a billion dollars after they got how many people addicted to otc opiates and cost how many lives??

they can afford to give away basically every medication they ever develop from the money they make there alone, 

P.s Martin skrelli is a p.o.s who I hope gets throat cancer and then throat fucked daily in prison",1,0,1615380937,mrbl0onde
