During the other eras like Dry Ships / Baltic shipping stocks, those were going parabolic on a daily basis like over 30X and making people millionaires. It was impossible to lose money (up until the end). While the story behind the GME mania is funny and unique and probably the #1 WSB story ever, the trade itself is ""meh"" for at least me personally, it's dwarfed by several other eras.
