7,gqjdst3,"It's like magic the gathering. You could sell and put it all in one stock, that's like casting a creature spell with mutate. If your opponent destroys your one and only creature that you have been mutating for three turns you're kinda screwed, which is akin to the one stock crashing. If you keep where you are it's like holding 4 and 5 mana cost cards in your hand with only 3 lands on the field and you can't draw any more lands to cast the good stuff, so you are relying on your three midrange creatures to survive and win you the game. That's you watching the green line go up and down. Or you could sell and continue to reinvest and keep playing your luck, that's like playing a blue black self mill deck to combo out a turn 6 win.

It's all a gamble. GME is a poompindoomp.",1,0,1615440757,Gerasik
