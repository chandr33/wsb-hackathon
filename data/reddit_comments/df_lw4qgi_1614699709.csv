She's been climbing in her gamestop world
I bet she’ll never have a wallstreet high
Until the hedgies are all forced to buy
I'm gonna hold me an uptown stonk
She's been shorted by a white-collar world
Because of retards with our diamond hands
She will be summoning the tendieman
Hey that’s our jam
And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she lifts off
And shoots through the sky
Hedgies are not so tough
Just because
We’re in love with an uptown stonk
You know I've seen her in her gamestonk world
She's getting tired of the shilly-bot noise
And all the shorting by those Melvin boys
We have no choice
Hold, hold, hold, hold 
Hold, hold, hold, hold 
Hold, hold, hold, hold 
Hold, hold, hold, hold

She keeps on climbing in her gamestop world
All apes are making sure that some day soon
Our girl will rocket launch right to the moon
