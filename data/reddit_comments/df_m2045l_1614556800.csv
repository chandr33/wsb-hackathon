1,gqge9ng,"I'm buying a few if i can based on:

A) My kids will iterally spend as much money as i let them on it - cards are available everywhere

B) Having played it - clearly their development expenses are low xD (heck a lot of the big games are made by users)

Literally no idea what their financial reports or anything just buying based on personal experience.",2,0,1615390580,quentinp

3,gqgen1o,"I'm in for a few, because I learned that alot of it is developed by the community and they funnel money back to these developers. If big backers are willing to drop millions/billions into it then shit, I'll buy a few tickets.",2,0,1615390745,Ninja_Destroyer_

5,gqgfqd6,"Just heard the news say 33mil daily active users, double from this time last year, in the tween-aged category. I'm definitely buying a few more extra tickets. That age range has terrible impulse control and love to spend grandma's bday money. To the mewn ladies and gents.",1,0,1615391218,Ninja_Destroyer_
6,gqgh32r,"Honestly, I’m in on RBLX just to try and get back the STUPID amount of money I’ve given my kids to spend on it! But I love how broad the crowdsourcing is. My 11 yr old daughter designs skins (they’re so ugly) and PEOPLE SPEND ROBUX ON THEM! She’s earning her own in game currency now. I believe they’ve nailed the open source gaming niche way more effectively and broadly than anyone else, with Steam being the arguable competitor, but Steam hits a different demographic.",2,0,1615391767,chuqz
