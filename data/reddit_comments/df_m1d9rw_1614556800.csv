1,gqcydcu,Just upped my position to 100 shares to prepare for when options go high to sell covered calls around a strike of 25. In deep on 4/16 calls. Everything is picking up and it looks like it will be taking off shortly. Still holding some GME shares and am gonna take profits from there and dive deeper into UWMC.,1,0,1615315973,MarbledMaritime
