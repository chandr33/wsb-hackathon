0,gph37l8,I think it‚Äôll fluctuate within a dollar or two. I‚Äôm new to investing but I‚Äôve been watching vaccine stock prices for over a year- been a few days after the news that J&amp;J and Merck will work together nothing changed. Gonna hold. Look into Novavax- very solid buy. Gonna start shipping vaccines by May then will explode,6,0,1614728349,StrangerObjective686
1,gph395t,Was eyeing some calls on this when it was around $73 earlier. Put in a limit order that floated on the last trade but canceled it after it sat there. Glad I did cancel it at this point but we'll see where she goes.,2,0,1614728371,killthehighcourts

3,gph3h47,"I'm not sure how it will go, but there is also a growing movement suggesting one of their medicines called ivermectin could be used for covid treatment. I don't believe it works and the studies where it does seem sketchy but i talked to someone who does and there is a doctor that went to congress to talk about it.

Also their stock took a hit pretty much when they said they gave up on their own vaccine.

I'm suprised there was no movement today but that's maybe cuz all eyes are on rocket and gme and amc ü§£",2,0,1614728485,Impressive-Move9344

5,gph3q2z,Boomer stock. Great if you want to buy and hold and collect dividends but i would not be expecting any explosive growth out of it,2,0,1614728610,Hammered_Time
6,gph3qhr,I think that is already priced into novavax. But if they manage the flu+covid shot and if there's a new strain that moderna and pfizer aren't good for(i hope not) and theirs works then they moon like crazy lul,1,0,1614728616,Impressive-Move9344

8,gph3vx7,Yeah I think you may be right. Considering the J&amp;J stock I think there‚Äôs a pretty decent chance that MRK won‚Äôt change all that much. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2,0,1614728696,SomethingInNothing

12,gph4eps,Well the science behind ivermectin won a nobel prize. But it's typically a medicine used for parasites!,2,0,1614728964,Impressive-Move9344
13,gph4phl,Ivermectin is available as a generic and may not be manufactured by only Merck. Not trying to be a bear; however...Merck does manufacture it. And it isn‚Äôt widely accepted yet as a therapeutic for COVID. Just some points to ponder for DD...,3,0,1614729117,FattyBallBatty

16,gph5rmz,huh? I‚Äôm not telling you that you should buy MRK. I‚Äôm just starting a discussion to see what other people have to say about its potential.,1,0,1614729653,SomethingInNothing
17,gph6e13,"Mrk is a slow mover and they been struggling recently as the chart is a blood bath. Options aren‚Äôt very liquid either. I think they below last ER and the drop out of vaccine race is why they bleeding rn. They‚Äôll need some bigger news to go up otherwise all I see is sideways movement consolidation then a further drop from which I‚Äôd look to buy FD‚Äôs at low risk. 

This just my take on it though",3,0,1614729977,ErectoPeentrounus

21,gph8qte,I haven‚Äôt bought and I‚Äôm not really planning on it. I‚Äôm mainly just curious about how the vaccine collaboration news will affect its price.,2,0,1614731183,SomethingInNothing
22,gph9nfr,Contract manufacturing isn't that profitable.  They are doing it for the PR and to keep a factory churning with minimal profit so they can ramp up their own product in the near future when covid dies down.  I can't see this moving the needle hardly at all.,3,0,1614731648,kayryp

25,gphd38f,"Yup all true! Nah u don't gotta be bear, just sharing info among apes ü§£

I know it isn't accepted but more like there is a fringe movement supporting it with some flimsy evidence of it working and merck being one of the biggest distributors of it in the us.

Again i am skeptical of it cuz most of the population does seem to want the vaccine and that's clearly a better prevention than having a possible cure when people land in hospitals.",1,0,1614733418,Impressive-Move9344

29,gpne3yh,I think it forecasts low double digit growth. I like that it‚Äôs also spinning off a portion of its business by end of Q2. There might be more growth on the horizon for both companies after this. The spin off itself will also generate a special dividend to Merck that could be used to support R&amp;D and buybacks. It‚Äôs trading at a forward P/E of 10 anyway so it‚Äôs a low price to pay and fairly low risk for the potential upside.,1,0,1614863920,brightskies2
