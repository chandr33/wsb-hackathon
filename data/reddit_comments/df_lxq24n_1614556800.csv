10,gpobxa1,THere are tons of loans right now on covid forbearance too.  This means that there should be an influx of houses in foreclosure or listed for sale to avoid foreclosure.  This will either be gobbled up b the market or create a deflating effect on real estate.  Bad for refi's but good for purchase deals if houses become more affordable and plentiful,18,0,1614879588,hbsquatch

71,gpoitve,"UWM is going aggressive on Rocket Today. Starting the 15th, Brokers can't work with UWM if you work with Rocket. My bet is on UWM here. They already are the US's #1 Conventional lender (unless that recently changed and I'm not aware). They may not have the best pricing all the time, but they are potentially helping brokers, which are growing rapidly in number, and Rocket is having agents get paid if they send them business (bad for brokers, and will likely screw consumers out of thousands on each loan). 

By 2025, their(UWM) goal is to eat up a crap load ton more market share. As an LO that has been watching them closely in the last 6 years, I think they can get close to their goals. Also, reading through the Facebook comments from Brokers today, almost everything is positive from them. Interesting. I didn't see that much support coming.
