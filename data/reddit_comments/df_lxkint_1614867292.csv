Stonks is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
Stonks is all we got
Lock me out of this life institution
I am angry and high on illusions
Yes, I buy, sell is not a solution
Trying my best, but hey, I'm just an apeee, oh
Paper hands need to say they’re sorry
We just need to worship DFV
Paper hands need to say they’re  sorry
So where's the squeeeze?
Stonks is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
Stonks is all we got
Talking 'bout our limits getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we loose it all
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got?
I can see in your eyes you're defeated
Try to fool yourself 'til you believe it
That you covered the shorts and not bleedin
But there's the moon if you jump through the ceiling, oh
So where's the squeeze?
Stonks is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
Stonks is all we got
Talking 'bout our tendies getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got? (We got)
