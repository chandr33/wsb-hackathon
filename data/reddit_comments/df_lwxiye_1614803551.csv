42,gplc2xq,"Copied from r/stocks

They have a market cap of 15 billion and as you noted have 7.5% of their market cap in straight cash! They have a forward P/E of 6.5 while RKT has a forward PE of 10. My brains a little tired and I didn't feel like doing the math to calculate their current P/E. Their share of the market sphere is picking up. For example, RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026. Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books

Commenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go  live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume  during the remainder of 2021.

They have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend, which as price keeps dropping increases. It was up to 4.6% last time I calculated it.

United Wholesale has invested heavily in technology. Findamortgagebroker.com, which aired a 2021 Super Bowl ad, was a massive investment. It intends to raise awareness of mortgage  brokers as a lending vehicle for homebuyers. Consumers will be able to  get referrals to a mortgage broker that will help the consumer decide  which product is best. Other technology investments include UTrack, a tracking application  that will tell the borrower, broker, and realtor the current status of a  loan. Blink+ is the company's loan origination system, which assembles  the documents and handles the nuts and bolts of putting together the  loan. Finally, EASE Docs handles the final documents for closing.Â The payoff for that technology is not only faster times to close but  lower costs to originate. In the fourth quarter, United Wholesale took  18 days to manufacture a loan compared to 56 days for the typical retail  lender. On the conference call, CEO Tim Forrester said that United  Wholesale's cost to originate a loan (including the broker's  compensation) was $5,800 per loan compared to the average retail cost of $8,872. This translates into lower borrowing costs. United Wholesale's  average loan rate was 2.74% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.89% for  the overall industry.Â Â 

They absolutely must have fantastic technology and workflow tools as they process loans that quickly but just go ask any of your friends or family whom are in the business what they think of them. One of my best friends is a loan officer who deals with UWMC directly multiple times a month, and he loves them, like, thrice as much as RKT whom he compares to a used car salesman (Tho RKT has good reviews online, not trying to trash them either, they're being beat down for whatever reason too)  and says the tech is so much cooler than anything else he uses. Their customers had an average credit score of 757 and a DTI of 36%. Not exactly clients I expect to be going defunct in a correction or pandemic.

Finally, United Wholesale introduced a  quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which gives the company a 4%  dividend yield. This is higher than most of its competitors aside from New Residential, an originator with a different business model. The Street sees United Wholesale earning $1.40 next year, giving the company a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times. United Wholesale's cost advantage may allow it to take share from other lenders

Obvious cant analyze a stocks upside without downside too.

Downside - The massive amount of shares make every dollar a 1.5b increase in cap

Counter - Does that matter in this market? Well until UWMC I thought not, but it gives people a reason to be bearish and somewhat understandably so.

Downside - Refinances will go down in volume causing profit to shrink if/when rates up

Counter - but I disagree that this will cause massive downside for the company. Refinance should level off as they increase original loan volume elsewhere which is their main goal, and rates are not intended to go up anytime soon

Downside - Big banks space - People liken big banks to home loans (BOA/WFC etc)

Counter - They should also be taking more and more market sphere from big banks and others, not losing it no?  Who wants to go deal with wells Fargo tho? People hate those motherfuckers and for good reason lol.

Downside - Market crash / Housing crash

These really don't have a counter, wont be pretty for most companies should this happen and is not something that I really take into account when picking stocks in most sectors. I'm not countering the downsides to say they don't exist, I'm just interjecting why I think they're not a massive reason to be bearish, but maybe I'm blinded because I like the company and have been in it for awhile (and I made a good chunk of change before merger) - I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and just the reasons I jumped into the stock, blah blah. Currently holding most my shares in my retirement account and recently added back in at 9.37 and 8.88 for another swing in webull. People online are saying this is heavily shorted, but highest I saw was 42% short interest (Someone said as high as 68% but I wasn't able to verify that) - Every time I type this up or paste this and modify it a little I get more bullish, double check their investor presentation and their recent SEC filings and... I want to buy more. At 8 dollars I just cant help myself, maybe I'll be broke soon, who knows.

Edit; Forgot, great advertising too. They're now on the Detriot Redwings helmets, they had a Superbowl commercial although it was very underwhelming and the company treats their employees rather well.
