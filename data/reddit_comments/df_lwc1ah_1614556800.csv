15,gpgjglg,"options are done as 100 share contracts so itâ€™s not 63Â¢ but 63$ 
if your not sure sure about this stuff avoid buying things until you are, you do not wanna get burned man 
the option loses value as time goes by (theta decay) so if you buy for 63$ and the price does not rise in a short period your option will expire worthless. i strongly recommend plugging the option your looking at into this before buying

17,gpgjvdf,"Right. I've been buying and selling shares off and on for 3 years. Never held very long, lost some, won some. 

But I'm seeing people spending and risking  $200 on an option, to see give many thousands of dollars in profit. 

I've been reading articles for days now, and still can't really see how it works. 

I wish it could be as easy as someone saying, ""Buy this option and enjoy paying off your bills next week.""",0,0,1614719348,JBMac007

First in line are MSOs currently operating in the usa. Second in line is anyone with $billions to buy or partner with the MSOs.

31,gpi5f23,"We shall see. For all intents and purposes TLRY and APHA are the same company. From that POV, right now they seem to be favored by first world governments (CA, Germany, now France) as a mediator company to implement legalization programs. They are also dominant in the space already. They've been aquiring US based companies. But honestly i just bought because someone on WSB a few months ago said they had some sort of patents and whatnot in the chamber for when it gets legalized. Also, im no dispensary, but it takes me 4 months seed to harvest. And those aren't taking into account breeding like Fastbuds, where you can get them to autoflower in 2 months",1,0,1614748884,eeyoreisbae
