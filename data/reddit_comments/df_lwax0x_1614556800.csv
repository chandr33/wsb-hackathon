2,gpgagne,"Interesting to me at least as I already have 40 @ 45.83. Also was thinking a post rona bump especially as it looks like things will be pretty much open this summer plus another when Boomers can get their dividends again. So you are thinking +38%, is that end of year or sooner if people realize it is undervalued?",1,0,1614715347,wookachuk
