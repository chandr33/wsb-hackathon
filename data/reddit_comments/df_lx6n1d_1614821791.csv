When MMs and Shorts can‚Äôt actually get the shares but they are legally obligated to either for hedging or for covering. That is when price goes parabolic.

You sell your ITM option for $40.00 = $4,000 profit. They give you 4,000

You exercise. Now MM has to get you 100 shares in open market.

If this happens in volume to an asset that is hard to locate you get a bidding war which drives price to moon.

Shorts have to post billions in collateral or get liquidated, borrow rates go insane. So they want to cover even if they don‚Äôt have too.

Seriously shares are the way.

Get yourself shares and then play with options for the funny money

66,gplttfp,"A (ex) market maker (MM) or an expert at tasty trade may be able to explain the contract-asset-price intricacies. Below is just a lay person's speculation.

Suspect some of these calls may have been bought by HF in combination with short stock (hedged calls) to induce downward price pressure, if price increases it'll hurt HF margin and reduced their ability for short attacks. A portion of these calls could be naked, which means price increase will hurt MM as they have to buy shares to cover delta or at least write Puts to synthetically cover. However a synthetic cover is not useful for expiring options, which means MM hedging as price moves will cause another gamma squeeze.

Either way, they can cause gamma squeeze, but not necessarily a short squeeze. A heavy gamma squeeze, or corporate action like (reverse split, recall, M&amp;A‚Ä¶), or SEC action (which won't happen) can initiate a short squeeze.
