5,gpme1jo,"If people had read it before, a lot wouldn't have bought into RKT on Tuesday evening at the 40 mark.

Everywhere on here, people keep saying, we are not a group .. everyone is in it for themselves!  Which is the 100% truth - yet no one believes it.  Get called a shill or a bot ffs when trying to warn them. 

So when someone feels they are part of a ""crowd"", or being led to believe they are part of a ""crowd"" on here, that's the time to nope the fuck out and watch from the sideline.",10,1,1614834208,PeteTheCameraman

12,gpmewpl,"""The New Trading for a Living"" by Dr. Alexander Elder.   

The 1993 audiobook is here https://youtu.be/SCDZ6QYYPuQ

There's a 2014 release though, which expands on some things, and cuts out some of the 93 stuff. 

I didn't copy paste everything directly, just the parts from the start of the book that I felt were necessary for the new investors here to read.",7,0,1614834771,PeteTheCameraman
