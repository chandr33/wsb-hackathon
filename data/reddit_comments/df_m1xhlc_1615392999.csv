I know, I know. We didn't part on the best of terms; it really wasn't you. It was me. I really thought I would be back sooner. ""Just a few regular trades,"" I told myself. ""A few SPY puts there, a few RKT calls here."" I thought I was strong enough, I wanted to prove that I could be a normal trader, go for normal plays with normal DDs.

But I'm back, because what I love about you is your consistency. 20% every day for a week now. I bought puts on SPY and SPY went up 1.5% at 1/3rd volume. I bought calls on RKT and it immediately crashed after the spike. I had puts on fucking DoorDash and it went up 10% yesterday.
