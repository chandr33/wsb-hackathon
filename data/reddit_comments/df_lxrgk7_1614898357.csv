29,gppqqd9,"Im taking the interpretation as no one really knows what's going on right now, and we're all in the same crazy boat that goes up and down and all over the place. I think DFV has the direction pretty firmly nailed and we just need to sit back and wait to get to where we're going. He'll let us know when it's time. Trust DFV.",1,0,1614901815,RaspberryPoptarts

31,gppr0ye,Nah it seems way more intentional than that. We're all passengers in this boat that no one has any idea the direction of. That's basically the GME market right now. But all the children end up at their destination with Wonka at the helm. He could have used any number of gifs to get his point across but it felt intentional. That boat ride mimics our ride through this market. So much disinformation and no one knows shit. We just gotta trust DFV.,17,0,1614901968,RaspberryPoptarts

40,gpptjbs,"This will probably get buried. For everyone who hasn't read ""the great glass elevator"" it is the sequel to the first book charlie and ""the chocolate factory"". It's great for kids and acceptable for adults. It's the sequel and one of the better book sequels that's little known to the public. It's a direct sequel so it occurs right after the first book. It's chaotic, has no defining plot scheme, and you get to actually visit loompaland. It's practically willy wonka part 2. I'd say it's the silmarillion of the wonkaverse. 

Anywho I feel like a lot of this subreddit's fanbase would enjoy reading the book. Highly recommend.

Also apes strong together.
