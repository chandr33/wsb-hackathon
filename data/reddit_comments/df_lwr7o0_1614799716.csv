So, anyway, I looked for a few others that haven't recovered all the way yet.  I picked ARI and TWO.  Both do CRE financing, commercial MBS buying, and commercial leasing.  they're cheap and they pay dividends.  idk where else to put my money right now lol...

somewhat related, the biggest name in aircraft leasing is AerCap (AER), which still has about 20% to go until it gets to pre-covid.  They do aircraft leasing, they are extremely well managed and have given really strong guidance for 2021.  deferred payments are starting to come in again and they maintained an 85%+ utilization rate for their aircraft throughout the pandemic.",2,0,1614805900,OlyBomaye
