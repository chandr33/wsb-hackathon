1,gqe9vwv,The hedge funds we fucked over in January? They know people here bought puts. They are using their pocket change to give us the middle finger.,2,0,1615338513,xaekai
2,gqeabup,Or perhaps the hedge funds we are currently fucking over?,0,0,1615338753,Seattle_Ace
3,gqeaeuh,My guess is that it’s sympathetic buying due to the tech rebound. I haven’t gambled any puts on it yet but I’m watching it closely,1,0,1615338797,Zestyclose_Hippo
4,gqeaujn,"- It did go from 210-&gt;140 in the last couple weeks and rose on a big day for tech. 
- Sometimes it takes a few days to release the shares
- pltr went up on unlock day (I know, way different, their employees and customers actually support the company) but decreased both before and after 

I’m short dash too. I think it’s a subpar company with a bad reputation and low prospects for growth compared to the last few years. I just dislike the stock.",3,0,1615339033,dominnate
