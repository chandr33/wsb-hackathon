22,gqhc32x,"Yup, I believe roughly 550,000 shares were borrowed sometime this morning and they were all sold off around 12:15, and that's what caused the steep downward movement. GME is now on short sale restriction, meaning the stock can only be shorted on upward ticks, and there's only 150k shares available to borrow now.

I may be wrong, but what happened at noon today literally cannot happen again today.",1,0,1615403570,Schittt
