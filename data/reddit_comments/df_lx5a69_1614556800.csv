36,gplzozj,"Devil's advocate here, no disrespect. It went from $10 to $17 today. Already at pre-Covid christmas shopping levels. Steady downward from 2016 on as more people bought their shit online. I have a hard time believing in brick and mortar retail at this point.",5,0,1614826205,KarAccidentTowns
37,gpm3b4c,"Completely agree. The only reason it may go higher than pre-covid levels is due to people being stuck in their homes for a year. There certainly is a market for physical locations, don't get me wrong, but most people do their shopping online now. This is most likely a plateau and it will pull back after summer is over.
