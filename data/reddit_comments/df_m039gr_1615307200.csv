82,gquesyn,"Excellent DD!

Shame it didn‚Äôt end up dropping much this week. Looks like daily average volume hasn‚Äôt really gone up so maybe the employees aren‚Äôt letting go of their shares yet. 

Do you expect DASH to continue to drop through the coming weeks? How far out are your Puts?",1,0,1615676328,Nago31
83,gquvmfz,"A retrospective on this:

DASH opened Monday at 145.82 and closed Friday at 142.03, for a weekly loss of 2.6%. The weekly high was ~149 Monday at 11am, the weekly low was ~130 at Tuesday at open. Over the same week, the Nasdaq rose 3.1%.

What went right:

- There were chances to make money. The Monday drop caused many puts to 2-3x over the course of the day. Tuesday open was red, and prices of 135 were seen on Wednesday.
- Over the week, DASH underperformed the Nasdaq by 5.7%. This is a large weekly underperformance, although not enough for profitable weekly puts given the IV.

What went wrong:

- The timing of the drop. The biggest drop was on Monday, but I expected Tuesday to be an even bigger drop. By the time Tuesday came around, the sell off was priced in.
- Not enough insiders sold. This is the biggest issue. We only saw 4M shares sold at open Tuesday. This is &lt;4% of the eligible shares up for sale. Volume was higher than normal through the day, but it‚Äôs hard to say how much of that was insiders selling and how much was shorts covering. Insiders are clearly more bullish on DASH than I expected. 
- DASH was put on the Short Sale Restriction list after Monday‚Äôs fall. This limited the ability of traders to bet on a big intraday fall Tuesday, and likely exasperated the rise we saw that day.
- Nasdaq came back big this week. The Nasdaq had a +3% day on the day of the lockup expiry, and a +3% week overall. Interest rates (the main concern atm from growth stocks) fell dramatically the day of the lockup expiry.
- Trading volume stayed low. After lockup, trading volume did not increase as much as I expected.

Other factors that were not considered:

- SoftBank and high-profile IPOs. SoftBank-backed Coupang IPO‚Äôd this week. There was therefore possible incentive to ensure SoftBank crown jewel DASH‚Äôs valuation remained steady.
- Continued IPO mania. Roblox also IPO‚Äôd this week. This may have supported the continued IPO frenzy.",1,0,1615686098,Natural_Profession_8
84,gqyschp,"There are two key things to consider here. 

1. More people than ever have experienced Door Dash so business may not fall as much as speculated. People are lazy and now many people have the luxury of having any food delivered like pizza.

2. New Covid 19 strains originating from other countries found in the US and have shown to be 50% more infections and has already infected people with antibodies for the original Covid strain. What this means is the strain from Africa is resistant to the current vaccinations and the strain from the UK spreads more quickly and may have a higher risk of fatality currently being studied. Normalcy may be returning but it could also be too soon as this act could cause another breakout for the newer strains. The flipside is unlike the original strain we are aware and many people and businesses are taking precautions.",1,0,1615770280,DaReapa
