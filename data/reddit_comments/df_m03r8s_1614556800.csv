2,gq5qyvn,It’s not libel if it’s not a false claim. If Fubo really has a class action against them then yahoo is free to talk about it all they want.,1,0,1615164072,Salty_Socks
3,gq5qzv6,Unbiased coverage is dead. It's sad. Good post,1,0,1615164086,gingerbakerisgod

8,gq5rnl5,"Anyone can sue anyone for anything. That doesn’t make the suit valid. I also notice that the lawsuit seemed to be SEO’d to the top of Google on very key dates, including the day before a large portion of short calls were expiring and the day before earnings... Seems a little too coincidental considering the lawsuit seems pretty flimsy.",1,0,1615164458,SwimPhan

10,gq5s2a3,"Irrelevant. None of what you said is actually a crime. Unless fubo can prove otherwise, it all is just a coincidence.",1,0,1615164685,Salty_Socks
11,gq5t0v7,"Is that a warning ☢️ sign? Just saying be alert on this one my friend
That loss report was absolutely atrocious",1,0,1615165232,UltimateTraders
12,gq5tw4e,FuboTV also shit the bed with their last earnings report soooo,1,0,1615165718,caseyspicerr
13,gq5web2,I don't believe they did. There should be a correction coming for that. My understanding is that they just crushed their earnings call.,1,0,1615167091,Christopher3712
14,gq5ymnp,"I have no position or thoughts about FUBO -- but yahoo finance is just listing the various wire services paid PR -- businesswire, accesswire, etc.  These law firms are paying for the info to get out.  It looks like FUBO uses businesswire themselves to get their news  out -- ie  ""fuboTV Secures Market Access Agreements...."" on March 3.

A lot of these class action law firms are the equivalent of ambulance chasers but these ambulance chasers are allowed to pay the money to send their lawsuit announcements on the wires. 

TL/Dr No yahoo finance has not been ""illegally defaming"" fubotv.

18,gq9xbot,FUBULL checking in. This plus the DK DISH partnership seems to make that case that competition is scared of FUBO and considers them a real contender. But fuck what a rough week or two for share price lol,1,0,1615250400,tendeeznuts

20,gqn754k,Love FUBO massively long but there is no way they (edit: yahoo) would risk the integrity of their platform for this. If there isn’t much news then these irrelevant lawsuit PR posts are all you’ll see,1,0,1615514107,must_be_funny_bot
