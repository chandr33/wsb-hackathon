17,gqg2xdk,Unemployment skyrocketed. I think most people chose buying food and paying bills over buying in-game currency.,1,0,1615385304,Bulletproof_Dress
18,gqg2ysl,I believe it‚Äôs probably split. The lower income people were broke but middle class had more money because they couldn‚Äôt do anything and expenses were down,1,0,1615385324,lubbin604

25,gqg4b7q,"It doesn't matter. Your argument was that Roblox had a multimillion dollar loss due to people having less disposable income, when in reality, 85% of the population had the same or more disposable income during the pandemic. So why did they lose so much money? ü§î",1,0,1615386010,c0ntra
