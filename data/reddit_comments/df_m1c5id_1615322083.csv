2,gqdcq91,"I agree on UWMC here. The shorts went full retard on this one. Dividend is limiting downside potential. How low is the stock actually going to go pushing dividend yield up? 10%? 20%?

A 10% a year yield would mean a $4 stock price and the stock has a current short interest of 31%? They're shorting at $8 for the potential to make $4 on a company posting strong as fuck growth and great earnings? Bad bet. Retard shorts. 

Not to mention the CEO is tits. When the SPAC was announced, it wasn't received well. He goes and does a press release saying he wanted to let investors know that they intend to do a .10 quarterly dividend. Post says he intends on going on Mad Money to pump his stock as well? And he says he isn't going to dilute the float.

Who doesn't like tits and who doesn't like this guy. 

Also it's being added to indexes.

This one's going to the moon. Get in. Save my post. Thank me later.

32,gqdks8x,"You bet that the stock will be worth at least 9 dollars on march 19. Essentially you bought a contract that gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy the stock for 9 dollars on that day. For the privilege to do so, you paid a 60 cent premium per share. Since each contract is for 100 shares and you bought two contracts you paid 120 dollars. Now if the value of the stock reaches 9 dollar or more between now and March 19 then you're ITM (in the money) and you can either sell that contract at a higher premium and take the profit or you can ""exercise"" the contract and agree to buy the 200 shares at 9 per share. You can do either depending on what your long term plans are or your longterm projections of the share value. Also, since you paid a 60 cent premium per share, you technically don't break even until the value of the stock hits at 9.60. It's a little more complicated then this and I would suggest you look into before making any more moves with options.
