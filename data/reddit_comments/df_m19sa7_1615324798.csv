2,gqdi98f,"Well, if that narrative continues to dominate, it will continue to win. Forever. Recognize that you have been conditioned, TRAINED to accept that it can NEVER change. I'd bet most people that were in the very beginnings of revolutions never knew exactly what they were starting until it spiraled completly out of control. This could be the spark of change, or it could just go out in the wind. We decide what happens.

Reality is what we (as in, the aggregate we, society) decide it is. The US is a country known for starting a revolution over increased taxes in tea. Now you're just going to let wall street's wife's boyfriend fuck YOUR wife? Fuck that. Those people have had it coming for a long, long time.

I'd argue 2008 was a lot about people simply not understanding just what the fuck was actually happening. This has the *potential* to be bigger than 2008, bigger than 1929, even, except this time our side is MUCH better informed and in a MUCH better position than the average joe was in those two fateful years. The stock market as a whole is leveraged sky high and GME is shorted so many times there are more IOUs for shares than actual shares on the market. What that means is that, in the event of institutional insolvency, it could cause a chain reaction of other institutions going bust as the liquidation of their partners' assets and asses causes their leveraged house of cards to fall straight into the earth's core.

This is a ONCE IN A LIFETIME opportunity for real change. Don't let it go to waste. Don't occuppy wall street in the streets; that does nothing. Destroy the hold they have over the market. Destroy it so thoroughly, they can NEVER recover. Finally, then, we may own the market, instead of the other way around.",1,0,1615324838,Stenbuck

11,gqdijje,"&gt;Comfortable people? Dude, I don't know if you noticed, but allll the way over here from south america I noticed your country literally ON FIRE from a cop kneeling on a black dude's neck. People raided the capitol because an orange idiot told them to. People are angry, they are afraid, and they are restless.

LOL, this is spot on.

The people that are comfortable are the moderates, and that group is drying up.

I would say that the BLM protests were way overblown by the media. It's wasn't an entire city that had trouble, it's several blocks in the city.

Hell, I drove through the CHAZ several times on my way to work and it was nothing like the news was saying. More like some hippie commune with people sharing their toilet paper and food than anything even remotely like a lawless area.

To this day my more conservative friends/family won't accept my word on that, they think that even out in the suburbs there were masked vandals running around throwing molotov cocktails at people's houses, and that just isn't even the slightest bit true.

21,gqdj60f,"&gt; traded at $40-$45 for a fair amount of time they definitely could have covered haha.

The majority of the time it was down there the volume was VERY low though (like between 25 million down to as low as 7 million). If initial amount of short shares truly were 140 million + then not much covering was done at the $72-$38 level. Add in the fact that some of the large volume buys we can assume are MM gamma hedging plus I have to imagine firms were shorting on the way down from $480 seeing as how everyone on CNBC was shouting how it would plummet back to $17 and I have a hard time seeing that many shorts being covered already.",9,0,1615325232,Pyro636

23,gqdj6od,"tl;dr: yes, if it's as people here are speculating.

let's say shorts are 600% of float. that means on a float of 50m\* they have to buy back every share 6 times. that's 300 million transactions. How high does that price go if they get margin called and have to cover?

the total market is 85 trillion dollars. at 300m transactions, a share price of 283,000 dollars would eat _the entire market_. is it going that high? unlikely but how high does it have to get to crash the wider market 10%? 20%? at what point would the fed step in? 

If shorts are multiple hundreds of float; that's what the shorts are betting on now, not the price, but when the fed will step in to protect the wider market.
