Google already knew about the article 15 hours ago! That's 09.30AM European time or 03.30AM EST

It went to it's peak, went down to $40 and my broke ass managed to grab 2.3 shares when I had some spare money at $70 when it went back up. If my 2.3 shares even went to $500 a piece I could pay off 2 debts, and get some things for my new home! Or a new guitar. Or guitar stuff. Either way. For my girlfriend she would have 5k!
