It's much more convenient and I can shake off as much as I want without it splashing back onto my pants.

I find that I can also just take a minute or two to relax, check the stock of course, perhaps respond to a text or two from the prior day I might have forgotten about

All in all, it's just a lot more comfortable and relaxing.

55,gqh2sjp,"ü§î I think you're grasping the stick from the wrong end. At this point the bulk of profits from the squeeze will be made by DFV and smart money. The rest of you are just future bagholders. 

This has had no impact on shorting (which doesn't destroy companies, equity financing a comeback for a failing company is stupid), and beyond causing regulators to take a good long look at derivatives I doubt it'll have much long-term effect on the market. Derivatives are what funded most of this squeeze for retail investors, so other than potentially shooting yourselves and many others in the foot... the same is true of shorting though, DFV was attacking one of the few tools available to retail that has minted many legitimate millionaires. ü§î And DFV works in finance... isn't that somewhat ironic?",1,0,1615399864,EggChalaza
