11,gpgo8zi,"From a person who is very familiar with lumber industry,  the limiting factor may be the availability of lumber.  When prices were down a bunch of the smaller mills closed because in the competitive lower market and they just couldn't keep up with the big boys.   Now demand is threw the roof and the bigger company may not be able to keep up.   I know of houses in the works that may not be able to be built because they may not be able to get the lumber to do it.   I could make more money running my mill than I'm make right now.
