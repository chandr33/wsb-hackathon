0,gqhd3lx,"I started with $150(shares at $75)

I now have $550 cash and $800 value in GME from playing swings 

Anyone not protecting their intital investment at minimum during this is dumb. 

If you own 100 shares. Fucking sell 25 of them to get your money back. 

Id rather no risk and 75% riding on moon rockets

Than 100% relying on something and huge risk.",3,0,1615403991,Mathewdm423

2,gqhd3om,Honestly im not too worried about the massive dip. If you look at how the past like 2 weeks have been its been slow and steady all day then a good power hour and strong ah. we got it up to 340 and people started shitting price dropped to 198 and here we are back at 260 trending sideways coming up on power hour. that was just a taste on whats to come. still hodling strong at 20 @ 124!,5,0,1615403992,Odd-Ad-8002

28,gqhd4dw,"No advice, and this comes from a retard who bought at 330 after the first spike, but I think what we saw today was a whale sell that put the market into panic mode. I have absolutely no financial background, but the dip closely resembles a damped harmonic oscillator (check wiki or some other source on this). If a whale sell is actually the reason for the sudden dip, I think it is fair to be retarded enough to still dream about the moon. I certainly am.
