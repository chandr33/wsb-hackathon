1,gq9btfq,"A lot of suits on TV are licensed where they are allowed to give investment advice. The thing is, not all advice is good advice.",11,0,1615239548,Two_trays
2,gq9burk,"As far as I know as a new investor something being down is the time to buy so that it'll come up. Maybe they lost money short term but in the next year, who knows what growth will happen on some of the old stocks. I haven't bought into any of them but I'm using the same concepts to get into the Green energy and cannabis sectors. They're down rn but I'm betting on the etfs and stocks to rise in the next 5 years to bring me some flexing gains",2,0,1615239564,ScarecrowNinja

5,gq9c732,"Suits on TV only give over saturated news. They don‚Äôt understand that Reddit DD has a significantly lower time lag than TV advise. My 2 cents; if you‚Äôre here and you‚Äôre able to analyze WSB, keep doing that. If you want your portfolio to increase slowly keep listing to boomers on TV. Young people naturally are more risk adverse hence why WSB keeps making risky moves which sometimes pay off. It‚Äôs not because WSB investors are reckless, it‚Äôs that ppl here are more likely to take risks",1,0,1615239719,farid9966

8,gq9czoh,And they‚Äôll probably bounce back up. Apple is working in making cars now. Fucking cars. They‚Äôre bound to make some moves the farther along in progress they get on that.,2,0,1615240079,boonby

16,gq9fv7l,I‚Äôm just starting in with all of this. My Apple stock is down 4% today. My meme stocks are all up today. I‚Äôm not worried about the Apple that‚Äôs down because it‚Äôs an investment. It‚Äôll come up eventually. I‚Äôm worried as hell about my meme stocks because even though they‚Äôre up today I‚Äôm being killed overall and they‚Äôre all gambles.,2,0,1615241400,narcolepticdoc

21,gq9oqv5,"For some reason people think they need to say that or else they will get in trouble.

You aren't a financial advisor unless you get paid for it. If you don't get paid for what you say you don't have to tell people you aren't a financial advisor, because you can't get in trouble anyway.",0,0,1615245829,GGnerd
