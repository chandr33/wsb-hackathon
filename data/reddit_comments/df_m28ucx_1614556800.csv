8,gqhuyj8,"Just wait. I don't think you understand what the point of holding is.

There is a GME shareholders meeting coming up, (June iirc) and with the recent changes and addition of Ryan Cohen and others to the board, it is a pretty important meeting.
Everyone (or every company/institution) that owns stock will get to vote on matters at this meeting (i.e. removing the CEO or chairman). There is a certain date (April iirc) when the shares are called back to be counted basically to see who gets to vote during the meeting.
The idea is that since hedge funds have shorted millions of shares, when we get close to that april callback, all the big institutions that lended those shares that were sold short are going to demand them back so that they can vote on issues that might come up during the meeting.
That's when the hedge funds have to start buying back at whatever the market price is, that's when the squeeze happens.
It could be starting now, or we might have a few weeks left yet, but sooner or later shorts will have to cover by buying a huge chunk of shares.",2,0,1615411629,donedrone707
