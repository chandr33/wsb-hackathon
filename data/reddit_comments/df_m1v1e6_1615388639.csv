6,gqg9v59,"This is really something special. $GME is like a truck on a frozen lake. If it moves to fast, the ice will shatter taking everything down with it. So now we have a driver (HF\* grey hat whales) ""slowly"" taking $GME to the moon. The ripple in front of the $GME truck is all the other shorted stocks that are correlated with the HF black hats being pushed up first so they can cover their losses in GME.

I think we are going to see some major fireworks with all the satellite stocks popping ($KOSS $AMC $BB $NOK etc) before $GME tops off. 

This is absolutely not financial advice. It is barely even a series of complete sentences.
