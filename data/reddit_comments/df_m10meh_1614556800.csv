1,gqazggx,I've been bag holding commons for years. No point to selling at the current price given my cost basis but I'm hoping for that scenario where everything goes right. Worth buying prefs at this point?,1,0,1615274402,sokpuppet1
2,gqb05kv,"I bought fnma at like 1.50.  I was margin called on my other holdings and figured I'd just let her go.  Didnt make much, and also figured the government would do something whereby my meager holding would go up in smoke.  Would've loved to buy hold from 1.50 to their previous prices...  only time and a bunch of effort will tell.",1,0,1615275014,Apprehensive-Bed5241

4,gqb2f50,"I'm looking at FNMFO on thinkorswim and it's say they are priced at over $15k per share, seeing the same on OTC markets website and the volume seems to be 0 on most days. 

This seems unusual. OP, am I missing something here?",1,0,1615277112,lucifer_alucard

6,gqbed3x,"What a bullshit post. 


To anyone reading this garbage. Do a search here on /wsb and educate yourself. This guy is bagholding and this shit isnâ€™t going anywhere. 

Even with restructuring COMMON shares  get wiped. As in you get $0. This is a golden goose that was stolen by the gov in 2008 and they are never ever going to let it go.

13,gqc4hfk,"Thank you. I understand the decision could easily go either way but I think the right thing to do would be to release those companies, hopefully SCOTUS sees it the same way. Will buy in if they haven't already made a decision by May.",1,0,1615303628,lucifer_alucard
14,gqcca4k,"I mean, know that if the decision doesn't go our way (and I'm short us winning on constitutional, but long APA) we get royally fucked. That's the risk that you will be taking. If we get APA I expect 2-3x return. If we win constitutional we likely get the full 5x.",1,0,1615306643,SirBuzzKill777
