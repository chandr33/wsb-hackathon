2,gpn4xwt,"I think CD project red was probably overvalued before the release of cyberpunk, because Witcher was that good. I don't see many people keep buying cyberpunk until it is significantly cheaper. The initial hype is over and the gaming world probably thinks back about cyberpunk as failure. It was so bad that people got refunds for the last Gen versions, because the game was literally dog shit.
The hack has done the rest for me, this company is hard pass for me until they redeem themselves.  So my price target would be around 100$, because nobody wants to play shitty games unless they are in a sports franchise.",11,0,1614857384,Schmibbbster

7,gpn5zoc,"Fuck this game, fuck this company. I hope they crash after what they did to console owners. 

I see you left that part out when you mention PC reviews, even tho majority of gamers use consoles. 

They won't climb back until they fix the game.",3,0,1614858263,fountainoftales
8,gpn65zw,"Witcher was a fluke, as enjoyable as Cyberpunk is (beat it multiple times), it's nowhere close, and I doubt they'll achieve similar with the next game. I believe cyberpunk will improve with new content, but you don't get multiple chances.",0,0,1614858404,vizzoor
9,gpn7csz,"I think CDR is a good pick if u think abt a long investment. Would still wait a bit if price finds stability or buy in when its lower.

Cyberpunk was overhyped which was why the stock was overvaluedâ€”but only bcs they couldnt fulfill the expectations. 

I think future gains dont lay in cyberpunk but witcher is legendary and a whole franchise + they maybe come up w something else which is that sick. 

Next time they should t rush things lmao",3,0,1614859335,NXC160
