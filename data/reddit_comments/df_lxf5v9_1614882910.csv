18,gpom2k7,"Time is one of the most pervasive concepts in humanity going back as far as when we were more ape-like. There is one thing that is common across the vast majority of languages, regardless of era, region, language family, phonetic system, etc, and that is the use of time metaphors in colloquial phrasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even ones we may attribute to financial systems most likely originated as time-based phrases in the older forms of languages. In your post specifically *spend a day* is an obvious one that is based on the expenditure of your time, not of a resource you have. Most off-the-grid cultures are not very time-based, and this was an unfortunate side-effect of the world being conquered by the British, as well as a weird American trend towards scheduling and not *wasting time.* Whereas, in those other cultures, time is not wasted as long as they are not stressed out, and a clear conclusion is that scheduling and strict timekeeping is incredibly stressful and takes a huge toll on the psyche, despite the fact that our internal clocks and scheduling are insanely precise and can handle it fine, if your dad didn't always get so upset over me being a few minutes late.",2,0,1614883858,Felicityful

After the stargazing, head home. put fresh sheets on the bed, have a shower, hop in bed and get nice and cozy. If that means sleeping under a blanket with the fan on so be it.

29,gpooeha,"I talked with my lawyer when I was considering this but when we put all the numbers together, my debt wasn't really that bad, just bad for the situation I was in, and seriously it is not as good/useful as people think. Rich people do it because it's the business declaring bankruptcy, not *them*. If you can possibly pay it off yourself, you will exit the debt a lot stronger in a position, whereas the bankruptcy filing is a serious dampen on your permanent record. It may not seem like 5-10 years to wait for it to slide off is very long but that's your kids' whole childhood, your entire young adult life, all of college, etc.

61,gpoums8,"Not gonna lie, I ignored this sub for years because of the crassness of everything, and just kept dumping money into my managed fund Roth IRA and 401(k). Once the GME stuff hit I got FOMO. But instead of using money I couldn't lose, I sold some old shit on eBay and made around $800 that I can play with. 

Got rekt on BB. Bought @ 17.49 but I'm not retarded and didn't keep screaming that it's still going to the moon. Once they announced the $10 price target I bailed. Opportunity cost is real. I can do something else with the money. 

The other night when some good DD got posted for RKT, I did some checking of my own and gambled $48 on two way otm call contracts, or 10% of my account. Didn't get greedy, and sold when I was up $550 knowing there was no way it would continue. I could have made more, but I am happy with what I got. Hopefully I can continue on these little plays now and then. But I'm never depositing anything else, and if I get to the point where I've tripled my original $800 deposit, I'm taking out the original so it's all house money. 

I think there are some legit good plays mentioned in here, but it's tough to weed through to them.",1,0,1614887379,-ksguy-
