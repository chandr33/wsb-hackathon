Do you know what that triggers? That triggers a screenshot of what you're claiming you'll do should GME hit X price. You are most *ass*uredly sticking a crayon in your asshole. Eating that same crayon? Unlikely. But once you pull that crayon from your asshole you have two options: throw it away or wash it, **OR** hold on to it in a ziploc baggy for when the day comes you may have to eat it. If you chose option 1 and the price hits shitty crayon eating price point, you must get a fresh, new, shit-covered crayon to eat. If you chose option 2 and price hits shit-eating target, well, at least you don't have to penetrate again.

&gt;**The Difference Between a Spinning Top and a Doji**  
&gt;  
&gt;Spinning tops and dojis both represent indecision.

and this line (this one sticks out as the most notable):

&gt;**Limitations of Using the Spinning Top**  
&gt;  
&gt;Spinning top candlesticks are common, which means many of the patterns witnessed will be inconsequential.

Also, looking at the candles since noon, I can't find a particular spot where the pattern really screams at me. Again, I'm still fairly new to technical analysis, but I don't see much reason to worry here.

Edit: After taking a more thoughtful look at the chart, I can see where this pattern could have emerged, but I'm sure that the massive buy-in volume after the drop was enough to reverse the effects of the pattern. I still think that the price could be consolidating for more upward momentum in the coming days.",3,0,1615413266,Endvisible
