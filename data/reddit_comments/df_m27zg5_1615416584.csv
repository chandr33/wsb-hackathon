62,gqi5z6q,"Probably, you need to set a realistic limit near the current price. Before ordering, I look at level 2 charts (where you can see every limit order currently on the market) and pick a price to buy at before filling out the buy order. Once you get used to it you can quickly put out your buy limits in like 5-8 seconds and usually get a price fairly well under a market fill.

Maybe not the best way, just how i fill my limit orders in",2,0,1615416676,mkstar93

[As far as I know, this is precedent is derived from a litigation case between Rhino Advisors Inc and Thomas Badian in 2003 \[SEC Filing Linked\].](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18003.htm)

A look into the filings found that borrowing stock short and leaving it unused results in manipulation in the liquidity of a security. Borrowed securities must then be exercised or returned at a loss of premium paid within T-3 of purchase. 

[From SEC.gov on Reg SHO Liquidity:](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7)

 

* *Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement*. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in ***bona fide market making***. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO’s close-out and pre-borrow requirements.

Methinks that means that the borrower has to settle the borrowed stock in a trade within the T-3 period or the MM must recall it to avoid liquidity issues in a security where everyone borrows the stock and it doesn't move because it is unused.",2,0,1615416704,_Exordium
