51,gphsomw,Volume matters... You need someone to buy it off you at $.20 to make that $$. Depends on the stock but this can be a factor. Also deep otm calls have less delta which means they are less likely to move as much as a call that goes itm. Plus no intrinsic value so if you can't load the option off on someone else it is likely to expire worthless. Certainly a viable strategy but those are some things to consider,12,0,1614741403,Fabulous_Ad_6076

You could theoretically do it on a long play or a non meme stock it's just you need to understand the play so you know when to get out or how much you stand to lose. Same applies to a meme stock but you are probably more likely to see wild volatility and tons of volume so that you can pass the hot potato to the next guy (that's why they call it bag holding because at the end of the day someone is holding that option as it likely expires worthless). I'm not exactly sure if it increases your upside relative to other options unless it goes in the money, but it definitely lowers the cost to entry. But if you had $1000 I'm not sure if it's better to buy 1 solid option for $1000 versus 5 way otm options for $200 in terms of increasing possible payout.
