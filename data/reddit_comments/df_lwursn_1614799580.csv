9,gpkgn4d,"Hedge funds just laugh at the people here, all the way to the bank. The only use this sub has to the hedge funds is as bag holders. The actual problem is retail investors have no power, even in GME. This place didn't trigger shit. Some hedge funds realized *they* could trigger a short/gamma squeeze and leave people here holding the bag at $400+, so they did. *If* it squeezes again, it's not the people here that did it, and the majority of people here will be left holding the bag *again*.

GME hype is entirely based on hoping some big hedge fund will spike the price and the people here will have the foresight to get out at a profit. Finding actual good plays on this sub is nearly impossible now that everyone is hoping for those 2 very likely scenarios and downvoting anything that isn't GME.",1,0,1614799703,johnsnowthrow

13,gpkgqdn,RKT is a premium company. Wall street does not like the ownership structure because they cannot get their sleazy hands on those shares to short. People say interest rates rising is a risk but the CEO says they perform well in both up and down interest environments. If we and the owners hold up the stock and not sell this will be a problem for those who borrowed shares to short. The company also declared a $1.11 special dividend as a way to return cash to shareholders. If the company as shit and going the opposite direction - there would be no dividend. Loan Depot is IPO'ing soon. That company is shit - I have had mortgages with them. Whatever the price Loan Depot comes out at RKT needs to be much higher. RKT has been in business for a long time and have the technology to move forward. CEO says they have things coming. Wonder what those things are?,5,0,1614799740,Radiant_Crazy5680

20,gpkh38r,"this. Obviously this big price jump yesterday was media hype, but honestly if the economy gets back into shape they will be fine. As it is, they are making a killing doing refinances, the housing market is on fucking fire for the time being, they dont really do subprime loans. They really have a huge presence here in metro detroit, they own a good chunk of downtown and are pretty much responsible for the huge turnaround the city has seen in the last 10 years or so.
