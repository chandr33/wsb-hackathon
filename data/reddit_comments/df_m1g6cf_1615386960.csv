78,gqgnegd,"For me, it's the combination of shares with trailing stop + bear spreads.

As the price moves up, and I have more (almost) guaranteed profit, I buy more shares and spreads.

""It literally can't go tits up"" unless GME hovers right above my trailing stop's trigger price for several weeks until all the options expire, then crashes.  I can always roll my way out of that though.  Other possible loss situation is crazy shit happening during out-of-hours trading.
