5,gpo9j58,"I was actually looking at the change in  volume of puts/calls, not the OI. You are right, there is very little change, I just assumed OI is from the morning/pre market and it stays the same until market closes, like I said im retarded and brand new to investing so take this with grain of salt.",3,0,1614878568,Investorian
6,gpogzl4,"Bro, I am amazed with all the effort you and a couple of other mods are putting in this whole charade. Well done. Honestly. I was briefly a part of our all-seeing powermod cabal and am still in a couple of modmail subs(century clubs) so I fucking know what moderating a sub with millions of users means. Hang in there, what can I say... godspeed to all of us.",6,1,1614881733,Pirate_Redbeard
