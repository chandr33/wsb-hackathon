1,gqfkp7a,I didnâ€™t have the energy to read your entire post. Iâ€™m making my wifeâ€™s boyfriend lunch to have it ready before he leaves for work and trying to do a little house cleaning. Is the general consensus GME will go up today?,1,0,1615372246,Lt_pepprs7

4,gqfkpxz,"Hmm, I think trading restricitions also played a major role last peak. It induced people to panic, and sell like bitches. I doubt this will happen this time, so I expect the peak to be higher. Indeed, as you point out, those who went in at 400 are more eager to get out, but they also now know that the peak will be higher.",1,0,1615372265,QuantopiaNL

30,gqfmbyi,"Agreed. The longer this plays out with this kind of volatility, the longer institutional / swing and daily traders can play on GME. I think this will be a slow and bumpy ride to 10k",1,0,1615373809,Drew_Woodruff

32,gqfmg2b,I donâ€™t fault anyone who sold when trading was restricted. Was a pretty unprecedented event and people work hard for their money. I think once we break 350-400 we see a huge slingshot though,1,0,1615373916,large_block

36,gqfnhg2,"Hereâ€™s the thing.  Many of those who bought high have already sold at a loss.  Others who held, held on through some rough times for a few weeks.  Now that the price is getting back up to where they initially bought AND then held all the way through $40?  I personally think those who are left will keep holding on because after all, the stock is now then higher than what they paid just a few weeks ago.  Theyâ€™ll remember why they bought in the first place and resume.

Some may sell, but I think those who held on this long are going to want to see some profits after they back into the green, after all, why hold at all?",1,0,1615374855,albino_red_head

45,gqfoehs,"People who bought at 300+ and didn't sell, why would they sell now?

It went aaaaall the way down to 40, if they had capital they would have averaged down as much as they could.

You're describing traditionally rational behavior, GME stopped being rational weeks ago.

The only thing that will change the current situation is if news/information comes out proving the shorts and call sellers have managed to cover.",1,0,1615375671,clocksfornipples
