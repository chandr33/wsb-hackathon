2,gpkb0px,"IMO Unity is underperforming. Unity is big in the movie industry now, with the emergence of Stagecraft technology.

They will blow up very soon. As soon as I make some good gains on the memes I'm hopping on that.",5,0,1614797259,TheRumpletiltskin
3,gpkb2t2,"Roblox, Unity definite maybes. I personally wont buy anything that has EA in the titles, hate that comapny and its shit business practices",27,0,1614797285,Spacer_Spiff
4,gpkbly0,"I'd just like to say, that's great analysis, really perceptive, insightful and prescient. And I'd like to add that, all things considered, especially with reference to the Tesla gamestop console app, that without prejudicing future journeys where I may or may not have moved to the back to lounge around, that I'd imagine a central based console with seats around it, and in the future, where I've come back from, that there's only two companies, Tesla and gamestop. Tesla's AI machines do everything and everyone plays gamestop while watching them.",3,0,1614797515,westbourn
5,gpkbu0t,"Agreed, they don‚Äôt put enough time into the actual games, just the micro transaction systems. I would buy Skate 4",3,0,1614797610,Drew_Woodruff
6,gpkc14d,Roblox could be the next meme,5,0,1614797694,christophertit
7,gpkcdi2,"I am actually surprised Bioware wasnt closed down when they killed Anthem last week. EA has killed literally every studio when thier game didnt meet expectations. Maxis with simcity. Westwood with C&amp;C. Im sure there aren others, but thise pop to mind right away.",3,0,1614797844,Spacer_Spiff
8,gpkcnva,I remember having a tv/ vcr ratched down in my parents suv and it was powered by a huge dc to ac converter that would smoke after 10 minutes. Made the long trips bearable haha,3,0,1614797973,Drew_Woodruff
9,gpkcsho,How would NVDA see a spike from this? Roblox will be huge. I do like Unity as I recently became more aware of just how much is done in the engine. EA can suck it I don‚Äôt much care for them.,4,0,1614798029,cathedralbones
10,gpkd0fi,Huge long term potential in Corsair. Amazing company. IIRC they got Elgato as well which let‚Äôs just be honest is going to be a monster player in the upcoming streaming wars.,4,0,1614798125,cathedralbones

15,gpkh6ss,"Obligatory I am stupid to preface this but...Agreed there will be more interest but how would that translate to better sales if they are already sold out of most of their GPU‚Äôs?

I‚Äôve been a fan of NVDA and avid user for 20 years so I‚Äôm this isn‚Äôt to shoot anything down just trying to understand.",2,0,1614799933,cathedralbones
16,gpkhnb6,Doesn't GameStop mainly sell consoles and console games?,3,0,1614800127,Scion95
17,gpkhop2,"Elgato is mostly hardware for streamers. Look up ‚Äústream deck‚Äù every single streamer with a brain has this or something similar. Capture cards to make it easier, nice cameras, adapters for really nice cameras to works easily on streaming platforms. They make a badass green screen that people love. Basically if you want to stream go to that site and buy 1 of everything and get a pc and you are good to go.",3,0,1614800143,cathedralbones

29,gpkksu4,Ya. Pretty sure the only thing that saved developer was Mass Effect and Dragonage. Even then last Mass effect didnt reveiw to well. (Havent played myslef),2,0,1614801481,Spacer_Spiff

35,gpnsyl7,Honestly if they were just given more time to do their art the release would have been much better. Overall I actually really liked the game but I'm a huge Mass Effect fan so probably a bias opinion. I will definitely be buying Legendary from my Local EB Games to support my favourite series though that's for sure.,1,0,1614871366,ThisLineLooksCool
36,gpod6ec,"Sorare, and anyone that follows that NFT trading card plus sports gaming model. 

Ubisoft already dipping in with a partnership, I could see something like EA and Draft kings here doing an NFL trading card fantasy game and raking in billions.",2,0,1614880123,longdrive95
