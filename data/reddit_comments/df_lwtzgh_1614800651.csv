30,gpkn99l,"Not sure about in here, but the Qanoner types are probably on the extreme end of being entrenched in meaningless culture war bullshit and who base their entire identity and worldview on it. They think everyone is out to get them by taking away their Potato Head children’s toys and Dr Seuss books as the next step towards soros funded cishet death camps. I’m only slightly exaggerating, I’m sure there are real people who believe crazier.  

They’re too dense and self-important to realize that no one actually gives a shit about them and that these kinds of things are rooted in money. More people will be willing to buy Dr Seuss books when they know that their child won’t be exposed to blatantly racist imagery and storytelling, and Hasbro can probably make slightly more money selling more potato head toys as a gender neutral, more production streamlined product. 

They literally can’t connect the dots to money and it’s useful for riling up a base for an election, so they end up explaining away something they’re told to disagree with by concocting a lunacy that would make a legitimate schizophrenic blush.",8,0,1614802555,ElegantBiscuit

Then I'd do my own research to see things their way.

It taught me to see the RKT pump and dump from a mile away, I rode the train and made more money than I've ever had.

Of course the dates matter.

The Entire premise of the entire thing is that there are certain dates linked to monthly options expirations that are very high risk times for anyone holding hedges and large short positions.

As most people are probably perfectly aware, that date was Jan 29th and it's in the past and it's not going to go any higher than that week.

But if you're a believer in this still, you've got to think it's March 19th now.

It's entirely a catalyst based play, if you're not worried about the date then what the fuck are you talking about?
