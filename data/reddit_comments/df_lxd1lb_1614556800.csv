8,gpmgj4x,"One thing you neglected to mention is that on Wikipedia, it states “As it has expanded beyond its home base, Academy has sought ""hot-market"" locales, places that from market analysis offered the promise of high-volume sales. The result has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation.” As a frequent customer, I can confirm that despite the pandemic, my local store was frequently full as Texas was just coming off of Winter Hunting Season. The next big thing will be fishing season and camping season so be on the look out for that. The only reason why I can believe for their short interest is their debt situation. It’s not a concern as their ipo generated funds and they are producing plenty of revenue to pay off the debt. Its financials are otherwise great and I know they have moved to expand recently. I bought at 22 and sold at 27 recently (Pre-market 52 week high) following a kind of short cover as the price skyrocketed in just that 1 week hold and short interest went from 70% in late January to 35% now. Might get back on it if the retard momentum gets rolling.",8,0,1614835833,Warning_Harzard
9,gpmgtf5,Thanks! I took your suggestion and linked them :D,5,0,1614836024,windrunner69
10,gpmgwt4,"It was up strongly in a day when everything else was selling off in the broader market. 25.89 (+5.42%) for the day if you include after hours. 2 times it's normal volume today too, and the call options did really well. We'll see when the party starts, the guests are definitely showing up",2,0,1614836089,itsokaytobeknight
11,gpmh2kn,"Thanks so much for the information :D I decided not to link source anything from Wikipedia, my university professors back in the day put the fear in me not to use it. Awesome to get a first hand account, we don't have any stores up in Canada yet. 

What was your research telling you to sell? It might help others make a better decision on the stock.",7,0,1614836199,windrunner69
12,gpmhpdk,"I sold because it jumped nearly 10% on the day that the short interest went from 70 to 35% and took profits. Wasn’t expecting the type of run Gamestop had because the stock wasn’t as shorted and not as many people had caught on to the potential of the business. If people catch on now, it could be a hell of a ride.",4,0,1614836641,Warning_Harzard
13,gpmikw0,"Good DD.  

It probably won’t moon but it’ll definitely go up.  Market cap is relatively low and sporting goods stores are definitely not going anywhere anytime soon.",3,0,1614837277,5or6_somolianpirates

15,gpmjl4w,Thanks :) yeah I think right now with covid they are setup well!,1,0,1614838032,windrunner69
16,gpmjpwx,"Haha yeah that’s true, I was surprised it’s on so many top short lists and has solid company fundamentals but no one on here seems interested. Once I did some research I was like, it has everything redditors want, but yet so few mentions!",3,0,1614838133,windrunner69
17,gpmv89y,"I got in from some good dd a few days back, got their options for 0.30 30c 3/19. It’s a pretty solid company, drove to the nearest academy to check it out. Pretty packed for a random Wednesday",3,0,1614848135,RagingHippo33469
