My father talked me out of buying 10 shares of TSLA pre-split, so did fidelity. Too much % in one company.

I bought 1 share instead.

Split announced, price skyrockets, It split 1-&gt;5, I lost out of $50,000 potential gain 

He tried the same thing with GME, 150@$38, told me it was a foolish buy and that I should sell even if it was a loss. (I didn‚Äôt listen this time)

Two weeks later he asked me why I didn‚Äôt tell him to buy.

53,gq93pm7,"You want a real answer?

The safe bet is:

* Sell enough to cover your investment

IE, you buy 100 shares at $10 each, you sell 10 shares for $100 each and now no matter what happens you ‚Äúprofit‚Äù (unless it goes to $0 a share)

Then you decide what you are happy with.

500 a share?

1000 a share?

Half at 250 half at 450?

Hold for 50,000? 

Its up to you. No one can tell you when to sell, only you can decide.
