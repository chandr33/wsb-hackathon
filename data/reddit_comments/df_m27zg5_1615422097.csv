47,gqigrev,"That's not what I'm saying. In my opinion, based on participating in markets like this for the past decade, being a voracious reader of financial news, books on HFT, etc... Big swings need a source of momentum ignition (upside or downside.) Typically that's large price action from larger players which triggers algos, market makers, and of course retail.  That ignition can come from many sources -- hard economic data, fed news, company data, earnings, etc. Or it could come from trading activity around key support &amp; resistance levels, etc. 

I've also spent most of my career working for companies with prop trading desks, they have a whole lot more money to play with than retail does. They can cause momentum ignition, either by dumping shares in big lots, running sell or buy side algos to split up large orders into different lots, or be extremely aggressive and just dump a shit ton of shares at the bid, taking out the bid stack, and then follow up with an avalanche of more shares. 

IMO, and I am just speculating here, most large market moves are caused by bigger players. But either way, I don't think today's sell off is because of some shitty Marketwatch article, but yanno, I guess that's your right to think so. 

And I see the real ""bad guy"" here are HFT firms and market makers",1,0,1615422208,beeeeeeeeks
48,gqigri4,"While all of this is true, there's still good cause to be bullish on the day with SSR in effect. Since shorting can only happen on upticks but buying at cost can happen all day upwards pressure tends to overwhelm the pressure from shorts. GME has performed pretty well on previous SSR days and seeing how fast the dip was eaten up today as long as we have decent volume we should make some chonky gains",5,0,1615422209,DouseewhatugetCarla
