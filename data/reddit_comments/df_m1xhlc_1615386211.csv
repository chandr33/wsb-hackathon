2) Sell the shares

3) massive sell off makes stock drop 

3.5) promise Jim Cramer a nice wet one if he talks about it 

4) buy back share at cheaper price

55,gqg4rd9,"The Jist:

The short positions imply a big guys battle between long and shorts, but the shorts being over leveraged mean that its a battle of attrition. who can usee the most am   
munition.

What that means? He doesn't like to give exact guarantees, but he is very strong on the fact that it will go much higher than its current all time highs.

He also is a HUGE supporter and explainer of the long term corporate story, and that essentially Ryan Cohen will likely do similar things Elon Musk did with Musk when they had shorts levied on them, AND he will also lead a revamp to make GME an E Commerce giant in the market like he did with Chewy.

He is hopeful of high market price turning into stock splits as that would really screw shorts.
