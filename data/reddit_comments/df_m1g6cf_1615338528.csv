6,gqe9xl7,"If youre going to play this fast on shit you have to hit a few key things.  


1: dont buy early in the day, this way when it hits the fan you can get out, day trade rules

  
2: accept you cannot diamond hand everything, take profit at like 25% or more. Anythign beyond 25% is subject to sale at any moment it strikes me.

  
3: you have to do it on shit thats making serious fast movement otherwise youre going to need to hold it longer

4: I avoid weeklies as much as possible unless its like monday, burned too many times. A week or more gives me time to get out  


It will not work that fast forever, only at certain times. I am not married to any one stock, industry or sector. I look at numbers only.
