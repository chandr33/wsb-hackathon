8,gqcqvlj,"but u think ALL of them gonna be bailed out? couse i can see the biggest hedgies will be fine, since they prob have ties in washinton, but still some of them dont right?",3,0,1615312465,CinaNeko
9,gqcr03p,Yeah they will let some fail just like they let Lehman brothers fail. But the favorites will be fine,3,0,1615312520,Ashpro2000
10,gqcr489,"They will NOT be bailed out.  Hedge funds are not considered key structural components of the financial system.  

The issue is whether the GME squeeze would impact the large institutional pillars as market makers (Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard).  Those are where you would see bailouts.  

*Note: those MMs with their own hedge funds should be considered separate entities so a Blackrock fund can die without taking the whole of Blackrock with it.",2,0,1615312568,JayArlington
11,gqcr70e,"They won’t because many are Long on this.

Also, more can just pop up after this. I’m sure there are quite a few WSBers that would be capable of running a HF if they had enough millions to get started.",1,0,1615312602,Username_AlwaysTaken
12,gqcr7fn,"yeah thats the shorts i mean, what would happen tho those borrowed shares? couse idk if anyone will take them since they would be GARBAGE",2,0,1615312607,CinaNeko
13,gqcreay,"It’s been a bull market since last years pandemic dip.  The Dow is at an all time high.  Are you fuking kidding me with this???  If a HF hasn’t made billions in the easiest market to make money in, and can’t afford to pay the piper, then they better file an insurance claim with whatever dumbass will cover them.",2,0,1615312690,Another_Dumb_Ape
14,gqcrk6p,"Their estates get bought up. All their property and assets will be sold at a discount from the banks. What's really going to be happening is hedgies taking a golden parachute and funneling it to their families before they leap off a building without a parachute. 

What's really happening soon IMO is that all stocks will crash to get panic sellers to liquidate their losses. But if people from all sectors of retail investing hodl into all their shares and ride the wave, it'll be the final nail in the coffin for them. This is the transference of wealth we've been hoping for. You don't know how truly fucked they are. I said this weeks ago, they cannot use their billions against the world's trillions. We have all the power as long as we don't sell shares to make a quick buck and if every fucking retard would stop trying to be greedy and buy up all the shares and wait for margin calls this game would be over instantly. No more options, no more buys or sells.",2,0,1615312762,2utes

16,gqcrob9,"nah yeah but the whole thing is getting them margin called right? like they basically have to cover it somehow, and if arent able then what happens? they have to declare bankrupcy to cover, and i get that someone else can buy the assets, but the gme shorts? is someone even willin to buy that?",1,0,1615312812,CinaNeko
17,gqcrpzy,If I don’t get paid out all my money in exchange for the hedge funds going under and out of business and showing that the stock market is exposed as a made up thing to graph the strength of a country and no one really knows what there they are doing then I’ll count that as win.,2,0,1615312833,troy9115

19,gqcrwxc,"Minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. It will encourage them to work a second job so they can support their families.

As long as I get some of their money, I don't care what will happen.",2,0,1615312918,Y1OG4
20,gqcrxi8,They been getting billion a year for 20+ years if this breaks them they have smoother brains than us. Fuck Melvin and the small short sellers Steven Cohen and citadel will be all right just a few billion poorer,1,0,1615312926,Richporter85
21,gqcs818,"na i get it but lets say the total losses for the hedgies is 700 billion to 1 trillion dollars (thats at 10k if im not mistaken) even if they have made 10s of billions in the last 10-15 years, having to suddendly cough up 100 billion can easily kill the whole operation right? plus they still have the obligation of the client funds. but ye i imagine there must be some kind of insourance for that",1,0,1615313054,CinaNeko
22,gqcsi02,"yeah again my question stems from, if they borrowed shares, and they sold it, and they need to give that share back, and they arent able, what happens to the original share, i mean no bank or institution would wanna touch those shorts couse they would have to pay it in place of the hedgie right? or am i missing somethin?",1,0,1615313180,CinaNeko
