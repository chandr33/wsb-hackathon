2,gpiouxm,"I got burned in 07/08 when they promised a solar future, seems the same to me as then, I won’t touch it now.

Back then there were a bunch of pop up Chinese solar companies that are now longer listed, makes me nervous.

There’s probably still some kickass % gain days in it, but be careful of which company / their past you pick.",4,0,1614765423,East-Ask639

Obviously if you’re 95 may be worth cashing out and enjoying the money but as a 20 something I plan to hold green energy stuff basically forever.

Fortesque is an Australian company so not sure if listed elsewhere however Andrew forrest chairman of FMG has plans in the works for the largest solar farm in the world in Australia's northern Territory and is in discussions to power Singapore via underwater cable I believe.

10,gpir3kc,"This is just my opinion: I think renewable energy (RE) is a good long-term investment, but you'd have to find the right company. And short-term you can trade off of sentiment; people are likely going to get hype with all of the subsidies, news, and promises.",1,0,1614767668,EdinsonC
11,gpirbes,"Depends on what country, morocco has almost finished their noor project that is the worlds largest solar power plant and field.  


Spain and portugal have already invested in underwater cables from morocco into europe that will allow for the harvest solar energy to be transported.  


The last key to open this economic boom is batteries to store the energy to also be used during the night,  
And i give you Rachid Yazami the inventor of the graphit anode in lithium batteries that won the noble price. He has a project right now in producing a revolutionary new type of battery that can fully be charged in less than 15 minutes without the possibility to catch fire or explode like the current generation.",2,0,1614767880,Trumpsrumpdump

16,gpixkxy,"Not as in tune with American renewable, but it seems to be Canada has little training or education available on it and a few plans with no backbone or weight, and Alberta won't take on solar or wind because of rambunctious weather (Lethbridge should have wind. Just mow the city over) however American Lithium Corp (Canadian) made a deal recently with BC uranium
 I'm sure once they're hungry enough a nuclear plant will be built, but renewable energy just doesn't realistically seem as close as politics makes it seem.
