I like the XL product line as a transition phase tech to get us on the road to full and dedicated EV, however I have not used or seen any, nor have I spoken with any users.

I would suggest reading the report and drawing your own conclusions based on the research and, if you so choose, chase down your own confirmations one way or the other.",7,0,1614878726,Sars250

3,gpobl20,A real product doesnt mean a beneficial product. I can make toasters that incinerate bread in under 1 second. Doesnt mean anyone wants to buy that.,6,0,1614879443,trtonlydonthate
4,gpodt0d,"Just because it works today as a bridge tech doesn’t mean it’s the long term winner for commercial EV’s. The industry is figuring out you can’t just put an e-axle in a standard ICE chassis - the weight penalty is too high. Needs to be designed as an EV-first, and XL fleet has historically always been an aftermarket retrofit option. 

Personally, and I am not a financial advisor, but I would not bet on XL. Commercial EV’s? Yes. XL? No.",2,0,1614880391,SheepdogApproved

9,gpp8yxx,"Same thoughts. I had a stake in XL because I thought there was money to be made in these transition years between ICE and EV. But big auto and EV plays seem to be adapting in-house. Enough so that I don't see XL having that big of a market share for any long term basis. 

For that reason, I got out with a minor loss.",3,0,1614893441,CadderlySoaring
