0,gpgdkqo,"I think FUBO has potential. I am a subscriber and there is just as much to watch on their platform as Dtv and others. Navigating the channel lineup sucks dick, but its workable. Once sports come back full swing, I think it will boost subs. And after a few yrs they could be a significant gain in share price. Their payment options are good too... opt to pay quarterly and you get their premium package. A three month bill with FUBO is still less than my 1 month for Dtv. It's a smart move. Wish I had gotten in when they IPOd at $12. Kick myself for that one. So long term, I think good buy. Short term it's gonna go up and down. As seen in past few weeks. Just my thoughts.",1,0,1614716692,ProudMonkey129
