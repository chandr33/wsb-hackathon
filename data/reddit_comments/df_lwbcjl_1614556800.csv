0,gpgcajp,I guess he's right to some extent. Do you think the 2 GME share holding apes who bought at $350 are fuelled by anything other than hype?,1,0,1614716138,Dmeagz
1,gpgcl5t,That’s a good point. But those apes aren’t the reason the stock went to 350 in the first place. This sub isn’t a monolith trading on hype alone is really the point I was trying to get across,7,0,1614716268,redidididididit

I’m Not a $300 holder... IM A $50 holder ... TO THE MOON OR TO THE GROUND We’re in this together 🤷🏼‍♂️",2,0,1614716321,Mark_ET-ing
3,gpgd4ma,They are going to take the side of tradition and “the way it’s always been”.  We are a disrupter.  They don’t ever have room for that.  We just have to show them.,4,0,1614716500,Majestic_Sweet_8591
4,gpgd5ob,Just some boomer hedge fund that will soon be fodder at this rate. Think about the same people whom refused to learn a different programming language. You'll soon see yourself missing out on opportunities or having limited upside in career potential.,3,0,1614716513,I__Surrender
5,gpgd9fj,"He’s right, if it weren’t for Reddit we probably wouldn’t know hedge funds are abusing the rules and making a ton of money. We would have never realized holding our stocks would hurt them so badly. People fail to realize that this is a lesson in doing honest business, fuck over the little guy... you might get yourself hurt. It’s amazing that anyone can see this as anything but the hedge funds fault. Fuck’em.",3,0,1614716557,Giant-Space-Hamster
6,gpgduwn,"Unfortunately, users like yourself are probably why OP's investment banker friend has this view of WSB. You fit the description perfectly. As an example, your reply doesn't particular say anything or have any meaning. It is essentially just 'hype'.",1,0,1614716811,Dmeagz
7,gpgdwly,"The institutional guys don’t understand the true diamond handed diehards who want the company and fellow apes to succeed, and they also don’t understand how many of the apes have absolutely nothing TO lose.  A few hundred bananas to help support what is deemed a good cause (help company, swamp hedgies) is nothing to someone who is used to always scrambling for money.  Stack up all of those willing to jump in and help, and you’ve got a movement and one that the suits cannot wrap their brains around.  All the suits can see/consider is money making and there are many nuances here beyond profiting that they’ll never understand.  It goes completely over their heads.  Which is gorgeous.  All of those years of being the smug winners and they’re now getting side swiped by a buncha apes.  💎🙌🏻🦍",1,0,1614716831,smsmom2021

So they are fuelled by much more than hype.",1,0,1614716952,burneyboy01210
10,gpgebm4,"Investment bankers are not traders and most dont work with equity derivatives. Did you expect your friend to instantly conceptualize option hedging and its effects on market flow? 

In any case, most people here dont understand what a gamma squeeze is either. Id bet your friend knows a bit more than the average person here.",1,0,1614717006,BarryZuckerkorn69
11,gpgen32,"They too are truly retarded, they belong to this sub more than most of the current users.

There is a report from JPMorgan arguing that most of the volume during the $400 spike was from the hedgies and that fellow retail retards didn't even push it to top 10 stocks on that day (considering how small WSB is compared to the rest of retail investors I can believe that, although they just estimated the numbers from other brokers).

If we filter WSB activity for people who just have a couple hundred bucks, we get a very different picture of what's happening. Not everyone here is a cat with diamond balls.",1,0,1614717139,MrPytlik
