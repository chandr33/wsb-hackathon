25,gqh0yy0,"Because it's speculation at best, and more leaning towards misinformation/false propaganda. 

Not everything is a short ladder attack. 99% of what this sub claims is a short attack is simply some big players locking in profits and in cases causing an avalanche of stop losses. Happened last time around as well. 

Its a good sale regardless, so hope youve bought in some more when it got down below 200. Should recover back on track soon enough.",1,0,1615399173,jtoro126
