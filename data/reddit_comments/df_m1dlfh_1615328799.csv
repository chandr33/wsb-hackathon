SI doesn't stand between 200-900%. That's horrible math from someone who just got into the stock market during the GME hype. They don't know what they're doing. There is an insane amount of math in economics. It is below 100%.

24,gqdrk6t,"So, just my uneducated opinion but...

You can already see the effects in other stock at the moment... HF's selling off their stock to consolidate positions.

I'm sitting on some stocks that were twice the price a week ago, and now have bottomed out as GME was rising. It's a great time for budget stocks!

Provided they don't liquidate all in one go, I think the market will recover... I would guess that's why the DTCC issued that statement.... So there wouldn't be a sudden crash when it comes time to cover. In other words ""start liquidating yourself before we turn you into a puddle"". Nothing fucks the market like the snowball from a sudden sell off.

We might find companies buying back shares if they dip too much, so that's a positive for those holding.

We'll also see HF's trying their dirty tactics on other stock, to make a quick profit to buy back GME. In fact I heard something that suggests other stocks might be getting big short Interest, but it might just be a distraction tactic.

At the end of the day, they will try anything to stay solvent... What is a couple of $Million fine compared to going bust and jumping off the nearest bridge?

If I was invested in one of the shorted HF's I'd be trying to get my money out as soon as I could, so they might be fighting a battle on two fronts.

Ultimately, the money won't cease to exist... And the market is fundamentally stable. Most of the people invested are still investors, so it's likely the majority will go back into the market.

TL;DR

Short term dips in all stock till Squozeagedden, then rebound.
HF's might try spreading shit around to hide their real position in other stocks, just to stay solvent.

Just my opinion.",1,0,1615329114,evolutionman

Not true. You can withdraw any funds that you've already contributed as it's already taxed income -- you just can't put it back in.

Further you can take out earnings before 59.5, but those earnings will then be taxed as regular income PLUS a 10% penalty.

There are other loopholes to withdraw early without penalty, such as if you plan on putting a down payment for a ""first time home buyer"" (even that is not entirely clear as one can technically be a ""first time home buyer"" multiple times according to Roth rules).",1,0,1615329991,AdGroundbreaking7387
