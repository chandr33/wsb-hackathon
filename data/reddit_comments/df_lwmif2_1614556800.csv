59,gpii68o,Silverback Bruce mentioned Russell 1000 too. If any other catalyst for the gamma squeeze will be defeated by HF. Russell 1000 is the last chance. As we hold a price above 100 the GME have a bigger capital sum. Which means it gets to level up to the Russel 1000. When GMe is in Russell 1000 which means EFT which trade in russel 1000 have to buy GMe stock inorder to update EFT. Buy GME means UP UP UP. Russel 1000 updates happen in May. EFT have to be updated until then.,1,0,1614759041,kuprenx

No, the point is more muddied than ever. You can't possibly be naive enough to think a single year 37 bagger is the tortoise route,  but you also scoffed at the idea of a modest gain from index inclusion as non existent.

In particular, my fear is that UWMC gets included in the index, rises, and then dumps when people take profits.  I don't want to be a bagholder when that happens and then have to choose between A) the time cost of waiting for the position of recover or B) chalking it up to a loss and looking for other plays...
