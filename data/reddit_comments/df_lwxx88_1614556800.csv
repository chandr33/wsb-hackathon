4,gpjt2fs,"They called it a ""day trade minimum equity call"", not a margin call but my smooth brain didn't understand this immediately after waking up. I just panicked seeing *any* call at $25,000. Heart damn near stopped. But, Fidelity was super helpful on the phone and assuaged my worries that I didn't really owe this money, and explained what happened. I did ask for a reversal since I don't have any day trade activity prior to yesterday but they said they can't do that, but did explain how to let the restrictions age out, and told me where to leave feedback on their misleading day trade document (even the rep said that didn't explain this day trade scenario adequately and understood my confusion).",6,0,1614789596,GhostOfSamurai

13,gpjve8f,"I've only taken a margin loan one time, and that was for an ER bill. An HSA would be more appropriate but this ape doesn't have one. But trading on margin isn't that dangerous if you don't commit to more than you can afford to cover. It's like regular trading with an interest rate for the cash you don't have, and I always shore up my margin debit every payday, if I have one (the ""not more than I can afford"" rule applies here).

It's kind of like gambling responsibly - some people can't do it and should avoid it entirely but it's not a terrible tool if you know how to use it effectively,",1,0,1614790577,GhostOfSamurai
14,gpjvi2d,"You can purchase with unsettled funds in a cash account but you gotta wait for those funds to settle before selling, otherwise it's a Good Faith violation and they can restrict the account.  They got you by the balls with a cash account too.

IE: if all of your money is tied up in stocks, and you sell those stocks to buy something, you're stuck with what you bought until the original stuff you sold settles (T+2).

I've got a cash account and a margin account and I greatly prefer my margin account because the only way I can day trade in my cash account is if I have settled cash in the account.  Margin, one can buy at close and sell at the open every single day, but the settlement period is long enough that even that isn't possible with a cash account.  Settled cash gets depleted quick",1,0,1614790622,Bcron

20,gpjyylu,"I asked my broker about this when I first enabled margin on my account, as I have a cash account as well.

Pattern day trading is classified per account and not per customer, at least with Fidelity this is true. Today they actually recommended I open a new account and enable margin on that instead (or enable it on my cash account), but I have marginable securities I can't transfer to a new account that make up the bulk of my margin equity. So I'll just be a good ape, wait it out, and trade with cash for the next few months.",1,0,1614792098,GhostOfSamurai
21,gpjz9y9,No I think you have to have 25k cash in your account to day trade. At least that‚Äôs what Robinhood said after giving me a warning for trading more than 5 times in one week. And all I have is like $300 cash in my account.,2,0,1614792232,WatIfFoodWur1ofUs
22,gpk11it,"Not on RH at least. You have to maintain a minimum of $25,000 at all times to do it. You can do it occassionally  but you'll hit a wall where you're stuck with the stock until the next trading day. Lost money several times because of this. But I'm just a retard.",2,0,1614792980,mike8roth
23,gpk89hn,"It‚Äôs also explained in the article you linked but it‚Äôs important to know about general day trade calls as well, even if you are meeting minimum equity as they will slow you down if you don‚Äôt pay attention. 

When you are restricted to cash there are a couple ways to keep your speed up other than hodling. If you start making smaller trades you can keep a cash buffer running with the 2 day settlement times on stocks. Options settle in 1 day, so cash day trading options is easy as you get that money settled the very next day.",2,0,1614796070,switchstyle
24,gpk8s8k,"If you are day trading in a cash account you need to pay attention to settled cash, otherwise you will start getting good faith violations, 3 of those result in a free ride then you are restricted to settled funds only for 90 days, which means if you sell a stock on Monday you won‚Äôt have that available to purchase until Wednesday

Cash available to trade is not the same thing as settled cash, if you sell something, that credit is given to you as available but that money isn‚Äôt truly yours for 2 business days. So you can buy something else with the funds, but if you sell what you bought before your initial sell settles, that is a good faith violation",2,0,1614796292,switchstyle

27,gpl6obk,"1. Cash restricted trading is better for you autists. FORCES  üíéüëê and you go do that thing your wife's boyfriend likes, when you need more cash.
2. Something sounds off, but maybe Fidelity has slightly different rules for margin. I feel like I only ever got hit if I sold off same day. So your example would still just be one... buy as many times as you want, but sell 1 share 2x and thats 2 PTD's.",1,0,1614811128,TWIYJaded

30,gpm03ut,"So far I haven't gotten any violations selling my cash account securities as long as the funds are settled by the day before transaction clears (as in, the funds do not settle the same day or after your the unsettled sale settles.

31,gpm3qjm,I believe everyone on RH trades on margin. The $25000 min equity is an SEC rule so any margin account with pattern day trade activity (in the US) is subject to additional restrictions like this and others. Some brokers have additional/stricter requirements rules for PDTs but the SEC rules are ubiquitous.,1,0,1614828274,GhostOfSamurai
32,gqdmsn6,"hey I just found this, thanks this was helpful to read. I think I got hit with the same issue, except for me the Day trade minimum equity call was effective immediately. On going to the Trading violations page under Balances, I can see that  Day Trade Restriction Effective - 03/08/2021 which means the clock already started from yesterday.

What I don't understand is there is a field called Intraday buying power which is coming up and it shows as 0 now. And I still have some amount as "" Available to Trade Without Margin Impact"" which is essentially cash (not margin) but it's not letting me buy anything. Not even looking to day trade, just buy-and-hold long term but it's saying no cash buying power available. Are they going to stop me from doing all trades lol, even the regular buy-and-hold?",1,0,1615326867,winkahpack
33,gqighl3,"Intraday buying power is your day trade buying power. Now that you're classified as a pattern day trader you see violations that can occur under a pattern day trader account. If you don't want the classification, you'll have to refrain from *any* day trades in your margin account for 60 days. You can still day trade from a different brokerage account, but the Fidelity rep told me any day trades in my margin account will reset the counter, even day-trading shares bought with settled cash.

Note that if you don't meet your minimum equity call your account will be further limited in the kind of day trading you can do from it for 90 days. It's unclear from the documents I read, but the rep said this restriction may extend beyond the 60 day reset of pattern day trader status, and might continue to restrict me from trading on margin for the full 90 days. He wasn't sure on this point, and I didn't have more time to wait for him to ask a colleague.

So I guess I'll find out in 56 days :)",2,0,1615422062,GhostOfSamurai
