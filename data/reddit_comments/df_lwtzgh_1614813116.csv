The downvotes speak for themselves at how many people are being fooled into losing money instead of doing their own research. Serves y'all right.

If you don't know how to properly trade, the last place to go for advice is WSB, and you're unironically retarded if you think otherwise.

26,gplfnbc,"Lmao the downvotes are because what youre doing and essentially confessing is predatory and unethical, go ahead and believe you got downvoted cos of gmetards confirmation bias instead of it being cos youre a snake who spreads intentional misinformation to misguide people who dont know any better.

These types of comments always seem to end with a lamentation of the changing tide and jerking off to nostalgia. Really seems like everything youre saying and doing comes down to salt, in your case because wsb is no longer in the good ol’ days.

That salt seems to motivate you to lie to people “to teach them a lesson” by losing money. Nowhere did i imply it was for your own monetary gain (although clearly it strokes your ego so not like theres no gain in any sense of the word). Thats not whats fucked about what you do.

Whats fucked up is that you lie to people who dont know any better in order to directly cause their monetary losses, if thats not illegal word but its sure as shit unethical.  Seems kinda wild that intentionally misinforming people to motivate them to execute trades based on your misinformation wouldnt be illegal but im not a lawyer so cant claim otherwise.  

I fully agree listening to and thoughtlessly acting on what some rando on wsb tells you is idiotic, i mean i just gotta take a half look at your comment history to know id be an idiot to listen to you. Doesnt make it any less fucked up

Edit: lying to motivate the actions of others based around something that isnt true or is partially untrue definitely counts as manipulation dumbass

Edit 2: hurr durr you tell me if what youre doing matches what [this](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/business-law/three-useful-things-know-about-stock-market-manipulation) claims are illegal and manipulative statements about trades. Seems like the way they paraphrase the law is word for word exactly what youre doing you fucking cunt.

An excerpt for your cunt ass:

“Manipulative statements arise where the person makes a false or misleading statement, which impacts market prices (or induces a person to trade), where the person either knew, should have known, or was reckless as to whether the statement was false. The foregoing paraphrases the rules in Corporations Act Section 1041E and the US SEC Rule 10b-5. Such statements are illegal whether they come from corporate insiders or whether they come from lay investors.”
