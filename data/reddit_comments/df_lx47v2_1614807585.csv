They are a long play, take advantage of these low prices to increase position $23 is a rock solid support and I can't see it going much lower but even if it does, it doesn't matter because in a year or two it's 100+

49,gpkyz75,"(Note: new to options trading)

I bought an AMC call (15.5c exp 03/12), cost me about $117 and it's worth (checks notes) like $22 at close today.

What's the smarter (dumber) play? Do I buy an identical call to ""bring down my average"" (which I have seen works well on stocks), or do I buy a replica of the call 1 week further out?

Just looking for some info on potential outcomes. I am NOT trading on margin or through RH, so no worries about my stuff getting yoinked",-3,0,1614807635,se7en41
