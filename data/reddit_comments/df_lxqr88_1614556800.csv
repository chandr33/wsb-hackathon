2,gpoj0xu,"I wouldn't touch Fluor.  Watching that organization flail at their last nuclear construction project does not bode well for the SMRs.  They would need a significant shift in management for any SMRs to be successful in the US.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also lets also not gloss over the lack of nuclear suppliers (which will slow down production and cause delays).  Westinghouse's AP1000 experiment bankrupted multiple companies across the globe (including themselves) with a fair bit due to inadequate suppliers.  Fluor was along for the ride for a bit and they weren't able to improve anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus while SMRs are ""sexy"", there are extremely large costs associated with a nuclear site (site evaluation, permitting, security, etc.) that have to be done regardless of how many reactors you have.  So the energy produced by a 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. SMR site will be costlier than a traditional PWR/BWR or newer (in NRC review) salt reactors.

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets get into the regulatory shenanigans they'll face.  All the plants currently in construction (only Vogtle) and in development are licensed IAW 10 CFR Part 52 for combined construction/operating licenses.  However if Vogtle and VC Summer (canceled after billions spent) are any indication- the licensing aspects are horrendous.  Seemingly innocuous design changes require licensing review at the utility and sometimes NRC level.  Significant delays and cost increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me started on delays caused by environmental protestors and NIMBY people.

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, if CAMECO can begin to sell it's uranium internationally, that would be a game changer as the middle east, China, Russia, and Africa all begin nuclear plant construction throughout the 2020s-2030s.

Personally I love nuclear as a power source.  It's an effective tool to fight climate change.  I've been working in the field over a decade and it pays the bills.  I just don't want to touch any nuclear stocks unless they have promising prospects OUTSIDE of the US.",8,0,1614882579,B_Rad109

5,gpoo97t,Iâ€™ve been reading up on Fluor. They fucked themselves over and over for like 8 quarters straight. Could be the textbook definition of a turnaround but theyâ€™ve been so retarded with what projects they pick.,2,0,1614884775,DingoProfessional635
6,gpooy7l,"&gt; The current US nuclear infrastructure relies largely on Plutonium inputs and is generally old tech that has been around for decades, but SMRs can run on uranium that undergoes a much less costly enrichment process prior to use (Plutonium is mainly manufactured in nuclear reactors from fissioning uranium due to its lack of natural abundance) 

What are you talking about? Plutonium inputs? You don't know what you're talking about.  ""Fresh fuel"" has nearly 0 plutonium. It's a byproduct of spent fuel from neutron capture in 238U (the abundant isotope).

Sure there's MOX fuel but that consists of a very small fraction because it's properties aren't as well known / good as UO2.   


&gt; .. wouldn't have to be converted into to plutonium first, just slightly enriched. 

First, dumb. Second slightly enriched? Most commerical plants are around 5% 235U, which is more enriched than in the ground but not bomb grade, or even the 20% (i think this is the upper limit) low grade.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; These are nuclear fission reactors that are much smaller, more efficient, and safer, than traditional reactors. Due to these factors, the upfront cost of integrating these SMRs into a broader modernized nuclear infrastructure could be much lower due to shorter project time horizons, lower material costs relative to potential energy yields, and thus less uncertainty/risk. Being newer and more efficient technology also results in less cash burn.  

Wrong again, SMR make money through the mass production of components. Any simple internet search will tell you this.  


Look, you did a DD in an area you're not familiar with. Say that next time instead of tossing out horse crap and accidently making people lose money.",1,0,1614885066,Dasky34
