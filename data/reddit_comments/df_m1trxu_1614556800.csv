39,gqg12x7,"What do you mean bottom price? This all depends on how many shares the collective apes own. If we own all of the float (float is the amount of shares that are able to be traded, if you buy shares, your buying from the float, and if you hold those shares, it will theoretically decreases the float, I say theoretically because the float number (in GME case 54.95M shares float) stays the same.) we could absolutely move the price just buy not selling. It would only take 549,500 investors with 100 shares each to own all of the float.
Some of you may not be aware how these large funds operate, they are sitting there literally trading millions of shares of the stock back and forth between each other, trying to chip away, or build up a share price. This is possible because of fungibility.",1,0,1615384317,WallStWarlock

51,gqg4mo9,"Shareholders with over 10% have to report within 10 days, whereas over 5% within 45 days of year end. This is what I can find in terms of SEC requirements.

At 12/31/2020 there were 3 shareholders that were subject to the 10 day reporting requirement.

Fidelity (FMR), they reported on 2/9/2021 that as of 1/29/2021 they sold their 9,276,087 shares.

RC Ventures (Ryan Cohen) - he reported on 1/11/2021 that he owns 9,001,000 shares, which is likely unchanged.

Blackrock - reported on 1/26/21 that they owned 9,217,335 shares. As they have not filed anything new seems they still own their shares. Blackrock's shares are seemingly in passive funds (e.g. iShares Core S&amp;P Small Cap ETF), hence they likely do not buy or sell much.

From the remaining shareholders, it is impossible to tell what they still own or not. Vanguard who reported that as of 12/31/2020 they owned 5,162,095 shares, likely still has their  shares since they are also seemingly in passive funds (e.g. The Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, owned as of 1/31/2021 765,498 shares).

The remaining 70 million or so shares that various funds reported as holding as of 12/31/2020 is impossible for us to know what the status is, unless you want to go to each fund try to find their holdings (if they report it) and put together that data.

I tried doing my homework here, to work this out, but the bottom line is the institutional ownership figures are simply stale. You can guess at it and extrapolate perhaps, but it is impossible to know. Would be great to know as it would give a better indication where things stand.",1,0,1615386168,aka0007
52,gqgmt4o,"Well it's hard to say. If every one of us sets a solid price at which we agree to sell, the price would fall really fast. That's the dilemma. If we decide were not selling for a year, then it might become stable, but when people are faced with life changing gains on the table, they can't help but take some off.",1,0,1615394001,WallStWarlock
