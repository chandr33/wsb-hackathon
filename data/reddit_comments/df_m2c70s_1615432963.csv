20,gqj4ixx,"Calls arent necessarily worth the shares they represent, and their value has other factors. 

If a stock trades at $10 and you go short 1 share in 1 account, and long 1 in another, those two positions will always be worth the same amount. But because you didn't own that shorted share, you have to pay interest on it, like any other loan. Thus you always lose if you hedge a short with a long.

With a call, every dollar the underlying goes up or down does not necessarily eqate to one dollar in the option's price. So if the stock price goes up, the call can hedge some of your losses, in exchange for dipping into your profits if the underlying falls",2,0,1615435020,TheDogerus

Isn't that what happens when a bubble pops? People think the top is reached, they start to sell, the price starts to drop thus causing more people to sell...

Note that I'm not saying that's what happened here. The speed of the drop, as well as limited volume (as well as the fast recovery and the stock closing green after all) lead me to believe that it certainly could've been coordinated and not a natural sell-off.
