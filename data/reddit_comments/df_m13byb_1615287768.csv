The time to sell is an hour before the hedgies flatline. I'd love a dd on how much they can be bled until. After that it ends messy. A country that took what, a fucking year to give its people back a lousy 1200$ of their money isn't paying apes 169K/share.

you look at the january squeeze on the annual chart and think that it happened within seconds. 

Zoom in and realize that it was also an extended period where the price rose just like it rose today. Just like in any other squeeze before. 

But yes... the HFs are interested in spreading FUD to people who have absolutely no idea of the Stockmarket to suggest things that plain and simply are not true, to confuse people and scare them into backing out.

18,gqbea5y,"I truly believe that the HF's that shorted the heavily don't have much control over what happens. I think that all these ""ladder attacks"" and whatnot are not actually a thing, and that the first go round had too many retail investors ready to paper hand at the first sign of loss, and we just weren't willing to admit what was happening. This time is different though. We've both increased immensely the holdings of the wealthy members of this group, who likely held through the first drop, and we've also increased the fortitude of the smaller holders in the community. This is why we're seeing small volume and heavy movement upward. We all know the potential price this can get to, and we all know that selling this early is not going to get the price to where any of us are wanting to sell. Mark Cuban was right, that this is our time to show the true power of the ununited retail investor. All forging ahead separately toward a somewhat common goal of lots and lots of tendies!

58,gqbgs94,"Simply put.. there is a huge reservoir filled with water that is the Shorts and Options Loss.
Now whales remove water, to decrease the level of the public reservoir to rigger the short-reservoir to to open its gates and flush it all into the long-reservoir where we can take it.

They push it as far up as necessary to make sure the people who shorted through shorts or options pay the bill. 

Those who bet short, try to prevent it. Those who bet long try to make it happen and the market-makers, exchanges and other insiders try to affect it as little as possible, to protect the illusion of a free market, while trying to control it enough to prevent the entire market from collapsing.

The question on where it will end is still open. It depends a lot on how many have to buy at the same time and what price we are at when the buys trigger. 

I doubt that they'd let them all default at the same time, so it will most likely be buffered over a prolonged period of time. This will reduce the maximum level GME will reach, but allow Retail to buy at elevated prices for far longer and also get a piece of the cake. 

Imho. 1k-10k is a realistic ballpark for the squeeze, but if we are lucky it could go even higher. We'll see when it happens. It probably won't be over in a few seconds, so we will have time to figure out where to sell before it comes to it.",1,0,1615290776,liquid_at

That being said, if the price does really moon, and go way above 1000$, then I got life changing money. Don't get me wrong, I made a nice amount so far and I'm happy with that, but it's not changing my way in a drastic manner. It's a few months of salary, and nothing more. 

So what do I do. Do I sell a few shares at 500. Or do I go balls deep.

 If the market was fair, I wouldn't even consider selling at $1000. I've done my research. I know about 15 reason why this ship should go towards the 5000$ range. But when the playing field is not level, how much does that lower the price.
