64,gqh7hlv,"It's easy, the hedge fund managers get together and decide they want to drive the price of the stock down. If they hit trading halts, they know they can do it with very little volume (just need enough to shove the price down X% to trigger a halt, instead of the excessive volume needed to push it down then keep it there).

So they choose a date and a time, then they execute their plan. If all works well, their manipulation leads to panic selling and the stock price continues to hemorrhage after their manipulation ends.

Oh yeah, and then they go on MSM and accuse their adversaries of manipulation.

I'm just an ape though, and when I see the price dip I hit buy. Doesn't matter if it dips 1% or 100%, I'm buying more regardless. I just like the stock.",2,0,1615401692,Viklove
