10,gqgghob,"Now would be the time to buy. If DFV tweeted at near $10K per share, then who knows what's going to happen.

At $300 this is still a bargain. Don't live with regret! Sure, $40 to rebuy would have been nice, but even at $300 for a larger potential is still a buy. I am going to dump in more. I don't care if I go broke.

18,gqgghtc,Some of y’all are too toxic. If someone wants to sell their 10 shares WHO CARES? That’s a lot of money to most people! Stop being so hive minded. All of us are here to make money. Very few of you “Diamond handed” apes with own any GME in a year. Why the fuck is your price target the ultimatum? This is why you will get stuck holding bags. Leave people alone. Be positive about the stock but no need to attack folks who want to take profits. Fuck off with that.  I fear how quickly some of you will turn on DFV when he sells a huge chunk of his holdings. Get it together! Diamond hand but don’t be cunts about it.,-7,0,1615391529,alldawgsgotoheaven
