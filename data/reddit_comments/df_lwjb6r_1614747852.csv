30,gpiiqpz,"Why did we not get transparency about how GME megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?

First, the thread wasn't made.

Then the threads made by users were being manually deleted.

Then we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of ""no more GME daily threads, more news later.""

That comment got deleted.

Then we're told ""it's because interest in GME has died down"" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)

Then RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off GME pushers.

Then we get told that the mods simply ""forgot"" to make the GME thread.

Then finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.

...

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On.

You don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.

I haven't seen ANY good DD on GME for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday?

Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN GME IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.

57,gpjcb69,"I like your level headed response but I don't entirely agree. 

I do believe WSB does have the power to initiate a squeeze (or at least play a significant role). If I say 50% of WSB Degenerates are fake accounts (I believe that to be a conservative number) that still leaves 4.7 million of us legit. If each of those accounts have 10 shares of say GME, thats 47 million shares off the table. GME only has 45.16 million shares floating according to yahoo finance. All to say I think we downplay our own potential effect on the market. 

I can only speak for myself but the reason I down vote new DD is largely in response to the insane influx of new degenerates to WSB following when GME was making headlines the first time. I highly doubt those impersonator accounts (not all of them are) are here to support our noble intentions. There is simply just to much new DD to keep track of. Because of this I believe we have to be more vigilant than we have in the past, and part of me does not want to go fact finding every DD...I refuse to treat reddit as a second job...god bless you mods.

For the record I don't just down vote everything that is not GME. I do not down vote AMC because I honestly believe AMC DD (and BB) existed prior to the the surge of degenerates therefore making it more likely an honest DD with no ulterior motives.",1,0,1614782130,Rebelsquadro
