Now the issue to me is how much interest rates needs to go up to pull money out of the market? Especially since money can come from foreign sources as well.

I would avoid FD's for now b/c who knows what will happen, shares seem safest and have no expiry. If you are looking for leverage UVXY is 1.5X and SPXS is 3x. One thing in the marketwatch article in the post is that there may be loans for institutions to buy bonds, which is pretty strange TBH. That could either accelerate or tamp the exodus, so who knows.

15,gpmtlmn,"OP, I also want to thank you for this gem of a DD. I see two competing issues here that I‚Äôve yet to make heads or tails of:

1) As you point out, raising interest rates will precipitate a sea of red (I agree) and could tank the market. The fed‚Äôs inability to effectuate QT (despite increasing interest rates) and contract the money supply would definitely tank the market.

2) As I reflect on Macro 101, I recall that cash holders tend to lose out in inflationary economies as the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes. 

Seeking shelter in the bear cave while watching my mortgage diminish (in relative terms) sounds more and more appealing. I‚Äôm curious what you thoughts are towards a third factor: Targeted sector specific devaluations. If I put my tinfoil hat back on, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past our friends on Wall Street to try and manage the fall (controlled crashing?). There are plenty of opinions being circulated about tech bearing the brunt of the bond yield spike. Is it possible that we‚Äôre beginning to witness deliberate devaluation of certain sectors?",20,0,1614846550,CandidTill6

A certain company might be hugely over valued  *cough* snow *cough* while others are just slightly over valued to recent performances and if their roadmap pans out, are actually undervalued. Like intc.  

Similiarly, while oil&amp;gas might be undervalued as a whole, some of the companies might be overvalued as well. There will be value to be found either way and if you hold long term (think 1-3+years, world moves fast nowadays), the change in trends should not be a huge issue?",10,0,1614847724,slashrshot
