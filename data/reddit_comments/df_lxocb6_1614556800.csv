Tldr : baba = us investors , jd/pdd = chinas amazon ccp owned",2,0,1614875524,tossserouttt3483726

10,gpo3p2b,Any Chinese company that you buy on us exchanges is an ADR in the caymen Islands. JD and PDD are no more US owned than BABA.,2,0,1614876055,Alien8w8

20,gpo637n,Yes atleast you understand how chinese stocks work some what. Surprised you donâ€™t understand JD ceo says china needs to regulate internet companies more while jack ma says less regulation. I think ma loses that battle,1,0,1614877081,tossserouttt3483726
21,gpo6bd5,No it's for Xi to nip in the bud Jack Ma and his fellow billionaires from having enough clout or control to challenge Xi's power. You can simply lose your private assets at any time under CCP.,1,0,1614877178,Edinedi
22,gpo7n4e,"Xi's power is tied to these tech companies. Without their technology China is just another ho hum 3rd world developing country. Again, you don't ask a company ANT, to help roll out a digital yuan, if you think it hurts your power.",3,0,1614877749,Alien8w8

24,gpo7t0d,"I appreciate the DD, but I will never ever buy a company owned and run by Chinese people from China. Also, when you buy an ADR, you don't actually own anything. You own shares of a holding company in the Caiman islands.",2,0,1614877818,ethandavid
25,gpo80nm,"Beijing is using ANT to help roll out a digital yuan was all I needed to read to know BABA is fine.

JD ceo sounds a lot like Mark z. After making his billions. Mark was all for regulations afterwards too ðŸ˜‚

Regulations typically just help big companies get stronger.",4,0,1614877910,Alien8w8

27,gpo8pbm,"Yes ant is now back in line and will ipo, they estimate it lost 70b or so in value from the ccp putting them back in their place. Baba will obviously slowly grow but if you want real gains this aint the play. Leaps would print though",2,0,1614878209,tossserouttt3483726

30,gpoccre,"Not to mention constant threats from US to seperate from china or delist their companies from the exchange. You dont even own stock in their company if you buy BABA on the US exchange, it's just a baseball card for their company.",2,0,1614879772,ZeroTolerrance

36,gppfr2b,"China is the US of the 1950s. I saw this in costa rica when Chinese restaurants had way more signs of actual Chinese influence. Think Chinese food without the American influence. A few years back I saw Chinese investment signs on a construction site in the financial district. And apparently, they are pouring billions into Africa via debt to be paid back (sound familiar? ) the future is in China. Like it or not, this I why people like Mark Z. Wanted to Learn Mandarin.

China is also not afraid of being politically incorrect in its efforts to increase influence and power.

Just hold. You'll be rewarded.",3,0,1614896459,Alien8w8
