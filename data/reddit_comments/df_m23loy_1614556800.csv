4,gqh1f2m,"Iâ€™d be down, but Iâ€™m tied up in UWMC. Also a solid fundamental company with a good dividend. Selling 10c and 11c against my shares for a month out has some pretty dope premium.",2,0,1615399339,Old_Prospect

9,gqh5s07,What do you think of their asset to liabilities ratio?,1,0,1615401014,alwayslookingout
10,gqh608d,I think itâ€™s related to the notes they issued. Iâ€™d need to look at it deeper but they are still delivering lots of shareholder value.,1,0,1615401102,dhsmatt2
11,gqh7nvo,You didn't sell at 9.20 today? Had two shots at it.,2,0,1615401762,dopavash
12,gqh9iok,"Thereâ€™s a lot of debts it looks like. Theyâ€™re $2B in debt with an asset of just over $2.6, giving them a total equity of less than $600M. Theyâ€™ve certainly done a lot better than the big banks since March 2020 with the stock prices though. 

The two major risks outlined in their recent 10K filings do bring some concerns though regarding interest rate and US dollar depreciation. They seem to have downplayed the risks though. Do you have any thoughts on that?",2,0,1615402507,alwayslookingout
13,gqh9svx,I like this DD. Good stuff... looks like TA shows a bearish pattern for short term maybe a month or so. Whatâ€™s your price target to get in where it bottoms out? Low 50s?,3,0,1615402620,Bobosboss
14,gqh9uvb,"I think all banks are facing those same issues. The question is, is this bank poised to handle it and does it present a value opportunity as compared to its peers. Hard to say, but on recent metrics alone, itâ€™s out performing. I think the debt is tied to notes, yeah?",3,0,1615402642,dhsmatt2
15,gqhaqnm,Iâ€™m on mobile so itâ€™s hard to find the numbers but it looks like only about $1B are from the notes. The rest are elsewhere.,2,0,1615403008,alwayslookingout
16,gqhd1ez,"I read an SA article and he indicated their debt was senior notes at 1b, due 2023-2027. So take it with a grain of salt. Admittedly, Iâ€™m not an accountant.",1,0,1615403965,dhsmatt2
17,gqhe2os,$800M due within 5 years. Another $400M after. Total of $1B in notes.,2,0,1615404395,alwayslookingout

20,gqhlcw0,"Nothing that we havenâ€™t touched on already. I do like the founder is still CEO and insiders hold a large % of the company.

Might be a decent dividend play provided they can keep it up. I am concerned the dividend yield is that high with only one year of payout history. If the company ever hits hard time, theyâ€™ll likely cut the dividend first, which may trigger selling overreactions. Iâ€™ll buy some since Iâ€™m an ðŸ¦§ that buys whatever I see on WSB.",2,0,1615407503,alwayslookingout

24,gqi5xwl,"I highly suggest you take a look at UNFI, undervalued plus high short interest. Today's move confirms how fucked the shorts are since it is still undervalued and dollars sold short are rising along with the stock. They crushed earnings today.",2,0,1615416658,MrDionWaiters

34,gqjwxpx,"Very interesting find Ima do some work on it and see if its a good transition. Been wanting to find more companies in the financial industry, market is ripe for some cyclical plays I think.

What notes do you have regarding what industries they're involved with? Quick skimming online on my lunch break appeared they seem well diversified. Curious your thoughts on that.",1,0,1615453103,Siceless
35,gqkdx6t,Cheers for the post! $RILY is my largest position.  Keep in mind they also have a special dividend of 3$ per share in addition to the dividends you mentioned.,1,0,1615465627,mcoclegendary
