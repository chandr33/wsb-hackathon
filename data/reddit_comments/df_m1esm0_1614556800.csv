2,gqd82ug,"Nah. It's lies.

Cause they could just sweep the orders after market closes.

It's literally they want you in the state of mind where this is a typical stock where it can go up and down based on the perception as given by the fluctuating price or news pushed by legacy outlets.

Essentially they want you to pay attention to traditional catalysts -- which may or may not be pushed on purpose.

What instead is happening is as follows. HF's shorted and looked to get rich too soon -- easily got too greedy. They got caught and enough people found out and figured out. And setting a high sell order means you are NOT susceptible to price plunge and fear selling.

Cause ultimately. The ultimate diamond hand is someone who never even looks at the stock to begin with.",19,0,1615320347,Raddish3030

4,gqd8fcv,I call bullshit.  Why did it work on Jan and then stop working once brokerages realized the might be on the hook and insolvent?  Probably because now they realize crazy high numbers might just be possible.,11,0,1615320506,readyg0

7,gqdadr6,What does it mean to sweep orders? Force cancel them?,4,0,1615321384,Tartania
8,gqdauvb,I seem to recall that RH was allowing people to place crazy high limit orders back in January and then one day they started limiting that. I wasn't sure if that was just RH being sketchy or if it was an industry standard that they were trying to disrupt. I didn't have a legit broker back then so I'm not sure what was going on elsewhere.,5,0,1615321594,Tartania
9,gqdb5te,"Fidelity caps you at 150% of “last sale price” which I interpret as meaning ticker price. Yet they allowed me to pay over 200% for a low volume stock once when I mistakenly placed a market order, and not a limit order.",11,0,1615321728,johnanon2015

11,gqdcgxk,If anyone has the correct answer on how it benefits brokers to include this limitation let me know. I assume it’s a costs thing,1,0,1615322319,tonyturbos1

Call them back and tell them you’ll switch brokers if they don’t",2,0,1615323189,Will_I_Mmm

19,gqdg40f,"Oh yeah, cause you bought it from them. They'll let you pay as much as you want.",6,0,1615323910,Tfear_Marathonus
20,gqdgi98,"TD was allowing sell limits of 10k but they would be deleted the next day.  they probably had an app or a team going through and deleting them to clear.  Then they lowered the limit slightly so instead of 10k it would allow 9999.  Then the fuckery started.  Now it don't know the limit other than receiving the error that its too far from the current stock price (no indication of how much higher we can place those limit sell orders, by the way).",2,0,1615324082,readyg0
21,gqdi9sc,"Now that I think about it, this was clearly bullshit. Even if MM's were rejecting orders, why can't the broker hold my limit order without sending it to a MM or exchange and then if the price does go up high enough such that it is within their realm of possibility of getting filled, then place it with the MM at that time.",1,0,1615324844,Tartania
22,gqdiek8,Correct! Example Vanguard let's me set ridiculously high sell orders but then cancels them end of day because they're ridiculous.,1,0,1615324903,MadJesse
23,gqdjrit,(taps head) now you're thinking.  They're limiting their risk from having to pay in the event hedge funds go bust and they're responsible yet cannot get the stock (aka covering their asses to avoid FTD or insolvency).,1,0,1615325497,readyg0
24,gqdkmfz,"Yeah, I don't get this. They're acting like it hard to have something ""on their books"". It's all fuckin computers doing the trades, no one is writing anything down on ""books"". If I want to sell something once it gets to a certain price, it shouldn't matter if it's $9,000 vs $300, it's still goes ""on their books"".",1,0,1615325882,Gasaraki

28,gqe7w2z,"Its lies, they told me this weeks ago when I placed a 5k limit order on GME. The trading desk gave me a similar line of bullshit. While I was on the phone I placed a 5k limit order on some of my shares of T (which trade at about $30). Those went through. The trading desk is just feeding us bullshit. They of course could not explain that. Its all a lie that they are using to continue to manipulate us.",1,0,1615337452,reconoiter

30,gqeerh6,"We're going to be coming up on that soon so better move that up (assuming you're holding longer).  Its a problem because by setting a high limit you prevent the  brokerage from lending your shares but setting it too low and forgetting about it forces you to exit your position if you forget to move it.  might have to move out of TD after this shit.  Meanwhile im getting emails from them stating 'we're here for you!' -- bullshit.  if you were here for ME, you'd allow me to set whatever limit i need to set.",1,0,1615341120,readyg0

35,gr1qb36,"limit orders go onto an electronic ""book"" but that book has finite space. the idea from their point of view is a crap load of orders that will probably never get filled just kinda... sit there on the books.
