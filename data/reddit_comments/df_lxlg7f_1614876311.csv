69,gpo5yv5,"Got in on GME and averaged down from $325 start down to $96.

But it gave me the investing bug. I feel like I ""get"" how this game works. 

I can only put in $100 out of every paycheck but recently threw in some tax money and decided it was time to get into PLTR.

I know that stock has burned this sub before (I lurked for a long time, even rode with you all in the original cannabis stock surge) but I think it's solid and it seems like it's a decent play overall.

I've read things, seen the Cathie (dunno who this is but DD was solid) DD and basically decided ""fuck it, I've got 0 Big Data plays in my portfolio, I could do worse than having this one"".",9,0,1614877029,MontyAtWork
