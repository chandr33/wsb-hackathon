6,gqfgc2d,"The reason I think they won‚Äôt do that is in my reply to your initial comment. I could be wrong, but if Cohen et al genuinely believe in their vision, a bump in short term capital would not be worth the destruction in their brand image that would come with that.

Who gave a shit about GameStop two months ago? No one. This amount of publicity and positive sentiment is PRICELESS and likely to last well into the future if they play their cards right. Any firm willing to throw that away for a short term capital bump would be more retarded than I am.

Again, I could be wrong of course, and as a current shareholder am biased, but I don‚Äôt see it.",1,0,1615368012,wobshop
