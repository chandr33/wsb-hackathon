every day its been gapping up 10-20% in premarket, bringing retail in to chase it, the stock hits 350ish today and BAM a whale unloads the fuk into all the buying, taking it down 50 bucks in the span of a minute, and causing a halt

suddenly when GME comes back online there are no bids and it craters hard on basically no volume because the whales pulled their bids

88,gqhxa2e,"First of all, there is no ‚ÄúShould they choose to exercise‚Äù when it comes to covered calls... if the price ends below the strike price then you WILL sell your shares. 

That being said, sometimes stocks are so volatile that the premium is higher than the risk, but it‚Äôs super rare. Personally I would never advise a call sell below the market price unless you are just trying to sell them and make a little extra on the premium. 

So the short answer is no, you shouldn‚Äôt set a strike price below what you bought them for. 

There is one exception: if I bought 100 shares of AMC at $11 but I think it‚Äôs going to tank to $8 before the contract expires then I could buy a $9 contract and just keep the premium that I would make to help hedge the loss. Again, I wouldn‚Äôt advise it though, I would just sell and buy more in the dip if that was my intention.
