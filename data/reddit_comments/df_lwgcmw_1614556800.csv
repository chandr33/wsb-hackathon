6,gpiphx6,"Basically tripled in price, before dumping. No one investing in it cared anything about fundamentals it was a giant P&amp;D.

With RKT, the run up at least till $30 (if not $40) is easily supported by fundamentals. The stock was clearly undervalued. I think we have a decent chance of seeing RKT anywhere from $50 - $100 before the week is over.",1,0,1614766043,aka0007
