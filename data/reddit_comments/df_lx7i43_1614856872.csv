Waiting usually leads to missing good entry points. I wouldn't hold off because if the stock rises you will soon be thinking ""oh I will wait for it to drop to where it was last week now because it looks like I was wrong"". Then it goes higher, then you say the same etc. 

Next thing you know it is at $40 and you should have just gotten in at $23. Unless you have insider info, the stock could do whatever it wants. 

If you think PLTR is a good long term buy, waiting for even a $5 discount is a waste of your energy. Buy and forget is my view.",11,0,1614861849,RedPanda888

52,gpnf460,"It happened to Brawndo Corporation.

But yes, misuse is always a problem.  Most computer programmers are not actually that great at programming and most programming is learning on the fly and blindly using other people's code.  Then, there's a lot of testing and debugging in the hopes to find all the errors and test all the extreme cases.  But at the end of the day, that software is only as good as the competency of those people building it.

I do agree with you.  The biggest problem is the speed at which any software can perform a task.  In terms of AI, it adds a layer of self-modification, logically or otherwise.  But we still have the same speed problem.  The only saving grace for us is that actually computing work for AI learning is monstrous and arduously slow, even for simple AI coding.  We could go ""hey, what about quantum computing?"" and sure, quantum computing is FAST...at only specific tasks and....slower than normal computers at other tasks.  Right now, we lack the hardware ""brain"" capable of making anything truly wild.  The reach of the AI is also only as far as we connect it.  An AI in a toaster can only affect that toaster.  But we also have the intent of things and billions of smart devices that in theory can aggregate together into shared computing.  There's still only so much computing power available.  The danger then only becomes programmer blunder, fast AI operations, and high connectivity or at least convectively into areas that have high social influence, like when the nobody buys Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator and the AI lays off half the country.  That's actually the specific danger of AI integration into bigger, influential systems, because the people making it are still dumb enough to miss a test case.",1,0,1614864508,mvw2

for all I know, the best that Tesla (which is presumably some of the best in the world) has to offer might be completely fooled if you stick a video of a road in front of each camera on the car.  All the genius tracking and shape recognition in the world won't help it then

its kinda funny cos innately you think of it as dangerous, or not trustworthy - like in the example of the Tesla i have this instinctive ""i'm not sure i would take my eyes off the road while it was driving me"" feeling... but statistically AND anecdotally its far more reliable than humans.
