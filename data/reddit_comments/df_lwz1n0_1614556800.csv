Anyone who sold at $40 yesterday was in the right, most are likely down from playing the game squeeze poorly. You can’t blame people for taking profit on a stock that “totally definitely must easily squeeze” 
These hedge funds are playing a multidimensional game against us. You can argue that “so many call options purchased forced mm’s to hedge their bets” and you still won’t be close to the reason that the big money let $rkt run up yesterday. 
WSJ putting stories out every 30 minutes about how rkt is the new squeeze, “move over GameStop”. If you want to make money in this market buy high then sell low.
