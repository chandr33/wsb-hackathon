You don’t have to be a genius to expect there to be a huge drop in GME at some point.

17,gqi0ewr,"Some more interesting points:

If you go to search for the article that is posted in the screenshot of MrDavidNIO's tweet, you'll see that there is no such MarketWatch article under that exact title.

HOWEVER, on the RH app, if you scroll down to the News section of GME, it still lists the MarketWatch article with the **original** title, ""GameStop stock was reaching new heights, but the meme stock just plummeted"". If you open the article, it will show the current article with the revised title, ""[The meme-stock roller coaster just reached new heights of volatility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208)"".

* The current article URL is also still the **original** title.
* Wayback Machine has [no captures of Marketwatch.com](https://web.archive.org/web/*/marketwatch.com) after 10 AM.

I'm not sure what any of this means for the validity of MrDavidNIO's tweet. Fabricated or real? We need his explanations.
