27,gpksy52,"I;ve read up, it's safer to take an ITM call. Greater returns are made on OTM calls. The reason you pay higher premium is because if UWMC is worth around $10 in April, our options will still have value. But the whole point of the play is that the stock should definitely be higher than 12 by then so we aren't maximising returns...

Maybe sell this one in a couple weeks and take out new OTM calls. I am ape not advisor",2,0,1614805022,WeenTown

74,gpl1i1d,"**Why are DD on OCGN getting deleted?**

This has a market cap more than 1B so meets the subs min requirement

Its the highest traded share today on yahoo finance

Its moving on news that the vaccine they are marketing has better phase 3 results than JNJ and AZN and also handles mutant strains better than the mrna vaccines as it is an old style whole virus vaccine.

Plus options trading just started up on it so heavy buying of otm options can cause a gamma squeeze. Its also being heavily targetted by shorts

So it is the quintessential WSB stock. But any post with OCGN DD is getting removed
