As he rolls through a small town in the middle of the desert he pulls into a mechanic.  Mechanic tells him that it will be a few minutes to check it out, so Jim walks next door to the saloon and spots a gloryhole in the bathroom.  He spends the next three hours sucking and swallowing as much texan boomer cum as he can.  At some point he remembers that his car needs to be checked on, so he waddles on over to the shop.  The mechanic looks at him and says, ""It looks like you just blew a seal"".  Cramer replies, ""No, silly that's just boomer cum on my face""",11,0,1614869003,Ewulkevoli
