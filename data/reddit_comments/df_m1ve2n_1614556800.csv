Loosing 500€ won't hurt him much and we'll it's his choice to do that.",1,0,1615375867,2nd_acc_was_found420

When he did I'll ask him for a screenshot.",1,0,1615375942,2nd_acc_was_found420

7,gqfosld,His financial adviser told him to stay away from GME when it was low tho. That's why he didn't do it.,1,0,1615376004,2nd_acc_was_found420

13,gqfpyqb,"The thing is that it was a good advise at the time. I mean no one knew for certain GME would go back up, we certainly hope for it very hard but in truth no financial advisor could seriously advise his client to go in a meme stock.",1,0,1615376989,FeelDT
14,gqfq109,Probably responsible advice!! He should hire that guy,1,0,1615377040,ciscophreak
15,gqfq8lt,"There are an insane amount of DD posts explaining the answers to every question here.  Try to look at some of those posts before asking, it’s probably already been answered in great detail.",1,0,1615377205,Substantial_Papaya
16,gqfq965,"Well that guy kept him from potentially loosing some hundreds bucks, but also kept him from gaining thousands of bucks.. 

Those hundreds don't hurt as much as those thousands which will be never there due to that advice.

I agree if it were about thousands, but it was about money which wouldn't hurt him loosing and prevented him to gain a lot.",1,0,1615377218,2nd_acc_was_found420

18,gqfqz8c,"That guys job is to keep him from losing money. If he wants to gamble, perhaps he should find a gambling adviser but it appears you volunteered. So what’s your next pick for poor old papas money?",1,0,1615377796,ciscophreak
19,gqfrhe0,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.

20,gqfryqf,"Well I got told stock market is basically gambling.

The only thing to make 100% sure not to lose any is not to get into it.

Also it's my future money, I won't just blast it out because some funny memes told me to.",1,0,1615378539,2nd_acc_was_found420

22,gqfu3yu,"Why's it fucked up to already plan on what to do with those some mill you going to inherit? 

Time won't stop just because I don't think about it. So it's better to plan ahead instead of acting as if things won't happen. Not like I'm planning to get it early by some way or anything.",1,0,1615380072,2nd_acc_was_found420
