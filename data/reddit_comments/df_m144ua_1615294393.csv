67,gqbm19j,"&gt;	either scenario I don‚Äôt trust myself not to hurt myself

Go talk to a therapist or call a hotline or something. 

I‚Äôm not joking. 

This is a casino. GME could crater to $5 today. It could launch and hit $1000. 

If you put $10k in at, say, $200, and it ends up hitting $1000, you‚Äôll have $50,000, so a $40,000 profit. After taxes you‚Äôll have a profit of, say $28,000. That‚Äôs great, but it isn‚Äôt life-changing. It may seem like it is, but it really isn‚Äôt - especially if you already have $10,000 in savings. 

Alternatively, you could lose a big chunk of your savings. If $10,000 is your entire savings, losing it could be really bad. It could be life-changing. 

Putting money into GME should be *fun*. If losing your money is going to fuck up your life, *don‚Äôt fucking do it*.",1,0,1615294458,djb25

1. Do some of your own DD and find out where you think this stock is going, within what time-frame and most importantly ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô.
Once you‚Äôve got some solid ideas down you‚Äôll have a better idea of your risk tolerance and can decide all on your own whether or not ~$200 is too expensive to buy in. You can also find out whether or not it will dip at open. Should you wait 1hr after open? 2hrs? Find. Out.
