1,gpk8kkt,"Lol, good read. Where I live a lot of builders have walked away from new homes as the material costs have doubled and no one wants to pay double for a new home when they can get into a used one for much less. 

I don't know what's going to happen long term with the price of wood but its something to keep an eye on for sure.",2,0,1614796201,chrisbe2e9

5,gpl76gn,"In my neck of the woods, (Texas) southern yellow pine is still relatively cheap. The cost of lumber seems to have peaked back in the fall. The cost of white wood, spruce or fir sourced from the North West (mostly Idaho), is still pretty high, but, at least here, it looks like additional production in the south is offsetting the rise in prices. Also, steel studs are becoming more common, which may suppress demand for northeastern timber.",2,0,1614811368,Hun-chan
6,gpnidbd,I work in the forestry industry and there’s a “secret” coming. Carbon value for timberlands. There’s lots of work being done to give a carbon value for timber lands. In 2-3 years this will come out and will increase the value of timber real estate tremendously. And guess who is the largest private owner of timber lands??? WHY WY of course.,2,0,1614866271,RangerForest
