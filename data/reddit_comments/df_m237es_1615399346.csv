I've had to come to terms with this myself, as I always feel like I should've waited five more minutes, one more hour etc., but guess what? You had the balls to do it. That bad feeling is just your hindsight working in high gear calculating the perfect move after the fact, because you're gambling with money. You should relax once that decision's been made, don't put in more than you can afford to lose, and keep believing in the reason you bought the stock in the first place.

The dip today was anticipated, so don't let it drag you down. The stock will lift you higher than you've ever been eventually. Breathe in with your nose slowly, out with your mouth. Repeat.

Diamond hands.

You got this.

25,gqh1g1l,Low volume options spike like that. When stocks move like this people put ridiculous ask offers in that make it look like they are worth more than they are because the bid is so much lower. For instance a $0 bid (no volume) with a $100 ask would show up as $50 value but in reality you would never sell it for $50. In fact if you put in the ask for $50 it would actually drop the value to $25.,2,0,1615399349,BJJJourney
