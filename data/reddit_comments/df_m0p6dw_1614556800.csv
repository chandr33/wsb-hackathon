8,gq93ghy,beyond trolls - if you decide you don't want to pay to advertise they move or even remove most of your good reviews and highlight the bad - even if they are from years ago.  Have a friend that said no to them - all bad reviews moved up - he didn't even own the company the year they were written in but they still knock the fuck out of you if you don't pay them.  Businesses are paying for absolutely nothing except not getting fucked by Yelp.  Legal extortion,10,0,1615235884,Ih8TB12

11,gq941f8,"Yelp is a terrible company. 

As soon as you create an account, a sales rep will harass you to no end. If you get any reviews, and if you don’t agree to pay the advertising fee of $150/month , they will remove them all and put them into unrecommended reviews and then argue with you that you asked for the reviews even if you clearly didn’t. 

They don’t want you to get away with anything for making that free account. 

Further, if u continue to ignore the sales rep and don’t agree to pay the ad fees, Yelp will sell your information to some business verification scammers and they will keep on harassing you. 

Do not use Yelp for your business.

18,gq998hp,"I don't as much anymore. A company with good reviews pays to advertise, yelp doesn't show the bad ones unless you go looking for them.  A company that doesn't advertise, bad reviews highlighted.  A company that did pay, realize they were getting taken for a ride so they cancel, their good reviews disappear.  Have a yelp account and tried to leave a good review for a friends restaurant, never showed up anywhere on the site, he stopped advertising with them a month before.  The only thing that bucks that trend is if you are a top yelper - their reviews always show but they do get status reviewed if they give a top review to a company with less than 3 stars.  Yelp blackmails business to get advertising dollars.",2,0,1615238399,Ih8TB12

27,gqa9cqo,"Confirmed. Know someone that owns a business and does not pay for Yelp. 

A situation came up where friend was being cornered to pay. At one point they said they would manipulate how the rating was averaged to lower the score and hide the 5 star ratings from business page when customers pull up the page to make it appear as if the business actually get much lower ratings.

32,gqbslsf,"I hear ya.  I'm trying to bring awareness to it's incredibly predatory and exploitive business practices targeted towards small businesses of America.  Multiple class action lawsuits have been brought against Yelp with them to just be thrown out because of a clause in the T&amp;C's when a business owner engages in one of these paid advertisement programs.    


I paid to increase my exposure AND to generate customers reviews/ratings.  I received all 5 star ratings but Yelp has an ""algorithm"" which automatically decides if those reviews are relevant to the business.  That algo decided none of my hard work or customer reviews were relevant and removed them all.  I tried to contact my account rep to understand the situation and as soon as I voiced displeasure with the practice they ceased all communication with me.    


Did I agree to the T&amp;C without reading them fully?  Yes.  Did Yelp pitch the ad program in a way that created confidence in me to do business with them without talking about the algo and how the review system worked?  Yes.  Is it my fault for not doing more research, Yes!  
However, the way in which Yelp operates is predatory towards small business and it's fucked up.  In light of trying to support the little guy and seeing these big money companies prey on the little guys, I just thought this would be relevant to the bigger conversation.

37,gqbvcu2,"I mean, I get what you are saying.  It looks like a crappy protection style scam.  

That aside, you are in the wrong place if you think what WSB does is take down companies. We just want to make (or lose) large amounts of money primarily through trading options.  

What’s going on with GME is anomaly, total fluke that buying stock has come to the forefront.  It’s a very special case where some hedge fund people did some really stupid things that created a huge money making opportunity if you entered at the right time.  

We also know that there are other subs that think we can be used for their purposes, but fuck them.  Most of the people who have been around for a while are only here to make money. 

Good luck with your vendetta, but I doubt you get much help or support from this sub aside from people saying “hehe they suck”
