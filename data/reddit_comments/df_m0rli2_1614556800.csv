5,gq9hr1m,"the spike from 55 to 75 happened almost instantly as DMTK announced a deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, 
I expect a lot more of those announcements to come,

the crash happened as a wider sell-off in the markets compounded by the NASDAQ sell-off",6,0,1615242290,zackya89
6,gq9mb09,"Surgeon here, I like the look of this.  

My only question would be how watertight their patents are.  Essentially it's adhesive cell sampling and then a genetic test, and I would think larger competitors could bring out something different enough not to breach patent but still do the job.

However if they become the lead in this field, then yes there's a potentially huge world market with decent medium term gains.",3,0,1615244547,Item_Successful

9,gq9sv4j,20 shares. Found them from Doc Dean Investing since I'm bullish on biotech and love his analysis. Last week's rise was nice. I still view this stock as a long play.,2,0,1615247993,Morning_Star_Ritual

11,gq9t97v,"I've had several family members who have suffered from Melanoma and the invasive Biopsies and subsequent surgeries. It's an awful experience and a new testing method like this will be a lifesaver, especially as far more people will agree to simple testing. With Melanoma, as with all cancers, early detection makes a world of difference and can be the difference between recovery and sadly often, death. After my family's experience I am being extra careful with the risk of skin cancer due to sun exposure and this test will directly make my life easier. 

I'm in for the reasons above and a solid DD. Good work OP.
