I'm much more optimistic about CGC or TLRY as they both have institutional investors already and large insider holdings. Yet take a look at SNDL, 1.6% held by insiders? So they're not even optimistic themselves? Maybe I'm being pessimistic but imo, there are better options out there.",1,0,1615307784,Jsand117
