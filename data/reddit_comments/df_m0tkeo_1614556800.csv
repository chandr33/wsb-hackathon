5,gq9srqs,"Interesting, I'll have to read this before I do anything else. For one, I'm much less impressed by slowing progression than any actual fixing. This is probably why share price spiked, because it's something patients must continue taking. 

Might do you some good to look at other news of using antibodies specifically in the brain, they work fairly well for things like tumors but have previously caused death in early stage trials when they're antibodies against rogue proteins too similar to natural proteins. 

Also just phase 2 is early and low N yada yada yada. Just my two cents.",3,0,1615247944,JinnPhD

17,gq9z0tj,"There are no effective treatments for Alzheimer’s. Slowing by 1/3rd could give a patient 10 extra years of their mind. Don’t be insane. If the numbers are accurate and holds through phase 3 it’s a game changer.

Though looking at the 3 month chart this may be priced in",5,0,1615251332,don_tmind_me
18,gq9zr9m,"I know both of those things and I understand the outcome. Still not mind blowing to me. A full 1/4 of patients had imaging anomalies suggesting edema in the brain and thinning of the bbb. 

It’s a phase 2, I’m not holding my breath. Also a long track record of failed antibodies for pathological tau as well. 

I’m talking about whether this will raise the stock price, not so much about the patients. Yay patients.",2,0,1615251735,JinnPhD
