I bought in for the earnings report and dividends, yesterday was nice and I unloaded half knowing it was probably going back to earth, with I would have sold the rest this morning but I’ve been skiing and wasn’t sure if this was a meme explosion or just a quick squeeze.",3,0,1614801450,Non_vulgar_account
