9,gqf5udw,Everyone should pay attention to the brand new accounts coming in to show off how they sold and made a bunch of money. Those are not real accounts. This subreddit is under attack by these fake accounts. Look at rkt.,1,0,1615358289,evDev84

15,gqf666o,"One thing you should know is that short sellers can just short it at anytime and cover. They can short and then cover at dips. This stock is making a lot of people a lot of money off the volatility. But when it keeps going up, yea the shorts just keep losing either over and over again or if they havent closed their $50 shorts... maasively",1,0,1615358566,theflappiestflapper

29,gqf7klp,"The level of shorting (whilst still high) is probably not as bad as some people are making out. Any drop in price is attributed to short sellers like they‚Äôre the bogey man behind everything and that literally no one is selling to lock in gains. 

Borrowing interest has been 1-2% so far this month, so they are hardly being bled dry on that side of things. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME",1,0,1615359775,iikun
