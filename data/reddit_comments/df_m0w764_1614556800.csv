1,gqa75oe,"Peobably not a good idea to offer a dividend as they pivot the company, that requires capital. Thereâ€™s other ways to basically guarantee that the stock orbits another galaxy.",18,0,1615255797,Long_Conned

5,gqa7rd9,"i mean never say never but also if we were rounding it'd round down to 0% chance of a special dividend imo. no one is buying this because they are looking forward to a few cents every quarter lol, they'd just be throwing a chunk of money towards a pretty meaningless dividend when i'd much rather see them burn that on transitioning their business model/building out the future of the company. why throw capital at a calming tactic when your shareholders are amped as fuck.",4,0,1615256125,amarowak

7,gqa8y59,"Or they announce a new share offering to raise $1B in capital, then immediately pay out $300 mm in a special dividend to shareholders. 

That would make the shorts soil their underwear, because they would be responsible for paying dividends on the shares they've shorted.",7,0,1615256773,JagwarRocker

9,gqaboay,0% chance theyâ€™ll offer a dividend before earnings.,0,0,1615258273,SportTheFoole
10,gqabvna,Does that actually happen for a dividend?  I thought all shorts just had to pay the dividend to their share lender.  Although if they were naked shorts I guess they don't have to pay at all.,3,0,1615258389,LaserGuidedPolarBear
11,gqabzqu,I still can't decide out if a split would be brilliant or some kind of trap that would benefit shorts somehow I haven't been able to figure out.,1,0,1615258451,LaserGuidedPolarBear

13,gqacoqu,Wouldnâ€™t they have to actually make money to give a dividend,1,0,1615258833,Marcush214
14,gqacy9g,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,0,0,1615258978,VisualMod
15,gqad4ca,A share offering would literally be the best thing to happen to shorts and the worst thing to happen to longs. Come on now. Think for a second ðŸ˜‚,2,0,1615259072,Verb0182
16,gqafami,"In a normal situation yes. But hear me out.. GME would suddenly have a stronger balance sheet  (bad for shorts) with $1B in new capital. And if GME announced a dividend, the short sellers would be on the hook to pay the dividend. That would increase pressure on the shorts to cover.",1,0,1615260281,JagwarRocker
