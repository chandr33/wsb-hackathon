4,gpivbma,"Mate no need to feel down for the sentiment and especially don't feel regret for making this post, it's 1000x better you put everything in one posts like you said to squash this thing, instead of having it pop up as frustration in every corner of WSB against u/zjz and rest of the mod team.

My two cents on this to start zjz a huge gratitude to all your work and that of the mod team, I definitely underline that I have much respect for know which I know is challenging being catapulted to suddenly Reddit's most in spotlight sub!

I am just new here and learning every day, the vibe and energy is amazing and the amount of effort put into moderation and members put into daily DD is PRICELESS you guys got me stoked for improving in investing and of course to make more and better chance calculated yolo's.

Yesterday was a momentum of several unfortunate events coming together and I believe a discussion in thread like this is a positive move forward. I hope this gets taken as positive feedback u/zjz as I believe in your integrity and this sub, I believe the biggest catalyst for people panicking is the already days of people accusing accounts with username WordWordNumber of manipulating sentiment, I believe this left door open for a momentum of distrust which backfired unfairly against mods when yesterday there was contradicting communication from two mods whether gamest0p would get megahtread or not. I believe things like the sticky comment in the gamest0p thread to flag and report suspicious accounts was an amazing sign of relief and helps to reassure people. The same could be done a day ahead to announce ticker(s) X, Y and the cat of u/SquishedPeter will get a megathread, and also (which was done usually, except for yesterday) to announce it's coming at 9:15.

This will give us the users who love this sub, support the fundementals and are just crazy retards who gather behind Wendy's for latest tendies, the references and grip to help new apes in community getting the correct information and keep FUD out together.

I was definitely feeling quite affected by whole parade yesterday in comments but thank you u/zjz, thank you u/admiral_asswank for putting your time and energy in to this. Now please automod reclaim your time, and you guys motivate me to become longtime involved member here

Can we make the default search result for WSB newbies a ""no-meme"" zone?

They enter WSB, and they get some hint of the memes of what us retards can give. If we were to just keep handling the situation by mass-spamming memes (and I understand that we CAN remove the memes from OUR searches), people are going to think we don't provide anything BUT a cult of reeetards, when in reality, we're actually WAY smarter than what we think.

I personally want everyone to feel included, not throughout memes, but throughout the knowledge. Yes, I sniff crayons all day, and yes, I ate glue 53 times during the GME rally, which causes me to have severe brain damage, but that doesn't make me any less intrigued by the current state of the financial markets.
