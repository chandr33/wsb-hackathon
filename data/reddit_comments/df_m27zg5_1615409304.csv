63,gqhpnvg,"Okay retards. Evertime I post an iborrow update, someone asks me to explain it. Here's the explanation in a simplified manner.

I go to [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) to check how many available shares there are to borrow \_from just iborrow\_. I know this isn't a huge picture but iBorrow does hold a fair amount of shares (millions sometimes). They get updated every 15min during trading hours.

Now what does this mean and how you can read it? For apes, only two numbers are important. 1. Fees. 2. Available

1. Fees

This is how much it will cost them \_just to borrow\_. Meaning the higher the fee, the less long a short would want to hold cause they'll be bleeding. Right now, its 1.1%. It's not high, but its something.

1. Available

This is what I like to look at. Whenever shares are borrowed, they'll eventually need to be returned. What you want is the price increasing but the shares keep getting borrowed. This means that although shorts are borrowing and trying to push the price down (supply and demand, and they create this illusion of high supply), the price keeping up with a lot of shorts borrowed is generally bullish. when shorts ""return"" shares, they basically need to buy it. when they do, they buy from people that sell, driving the price up.

From today alone, I think we're at like 700k shares borrowed on iborrow alone.

**ALSO, it's unlikely that borrows across different platforms are disporportionate. So if people are hella borrowing from iborrow, expect that shorts are borrowing from the hundreds of other platforms that let them do this**",8,2,1615409328,pixelwalrusca
