14,gqeub4r,"I personally have 14K in my savings. Do I wish I bought more than 3 shares at 100? Fuck yeah I do. I wish I went all the fuck in. Can I afford to potentially lose that money though? No. 

I will always wonder what if I bought 140 shares of GME with my savings, but if it went south I would‚Äôve been fucked. My fianc√© and I are building a house and we wouldn‚Äôt have a big part of our down payment if I lost it. Those are things you have to assess when yoloing. I‚Äôm brain is smooth but not smooth enough to potentially lose my relationship because I decided to yolo my savings into a stock. I‚Äôm holding those 3 shares until it goes to the moon and nothing less, but also nothing more.

Hindsight‚Äôs a bitch but you always have to consider the situation you‚Äôre in and risk tolerance when it comes to volatile stocks. I know GME is mooning right now but there‚Äôs a reason a lot of people are waiting for us to come get them at 300 and 400. People say diamond hands but when it starts hitting 400-500 the real diamond hand test begins. It starts becoming harder and harder to not take 40-50K profits for a lot of people like us who don‚Äôt make millions a year.",5,0,1615349900,andytobbles
