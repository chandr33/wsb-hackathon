Maybe RKT was a distraction, maybe it wasn't. I bought in around 28, and got out at 35 my initial cost, keeping some shares as my profit. If was a hedgie distraction, please, bring more of them. I like free shares in stocks.",6,0,1614874661,xaekai

23,gpo3w1l,Hey I'm legit UWMC is a good play. I watched living in Michigan how fast UWMC has grown and stably too. I was excited when they first stated they were going public. I was surprised that it was valued so low.,16,0,1614876137,Tr1ppyH1ppi3
24,gpo4lka,"Sorry don't know if you read my edit, but in the moment I interpreted that as being an ass, I've seen a lot of people saying UWMC is being shilled by new accounts, and I've noticed that there are actually a fair amount of old accounts posting about it too, so my answer is just to big dick people complaining about account age, when realistically anyone could have good DD, we're here to lose (wait no I mean make) money not start flame wars.

And I can understand lurking for I long time, I've done it for years myself you just gotta find sub where you enjoy posting and find your grove with it, sorry for being an ass, might just be a bit upset how in the hole I am, but I'm still holding",2,0,1614876440,rtgb3

28,gpo60f0,"In reality I probably agree with you that they're some fishy stuff going on on this sub, I mean if I was a hedge fund it would be dumb of me to try and not weaponize the collective idiocy here, but might as well try and ride their weaponization of it while it's happening",2,0,1614877048,rtgb3

40,gpoegyo,The reason why I wrote this wasn’t about the company itself but the posting hype around it.

42,gpof9a2,"Dude I was smelling the same stench you were. After all, the best lies are the ones that resemble the truth. 

However, I do have some experience with them. My mortgage has been held by 3 separate companies in the last 2 years. UWM was one of them, and easily the most pleasant to deal with. Now, that doesn't always translate to tendies, of course. 

However, this stock is very undervalued in my opinion. I've always lurked here too, been on reddit for several years because I joined for the forbidden kr4pto currencies. 

It just dropped under 9 bucks, and for the market cap versus the actual market share they have I think it's gonna go up anyways regardless of a retail pump. 

Anyways I am in for some 3/19 $16c. We'll see if they do anything.",2,0,1614881000,Rellicus
43,gpog9p0,They're hands down the fastest and it's not really comparable. The key is you need to send in clean files. They have been on a hiring frenzy and their junior underwriters are very green. Anything complicated needs help or to be sent to another bank. Self-Employed or variable income employees have a hard time through UWM and I send those loans to other partners that still get deals done in 20-30 days. But if I need a 7-14 day close they are the #1 choice.,4,0,1614881432,enjoi8
44,gpogjzi,"I wish you well bud! The convo kinda got turned on me but all I was trying to do is raise some flags. It had nothing to do with the company and all to do with the moon hype. It could very well go to the moon but this hurry up and hop on while you can narrative is something I feel right on. If it’s a good play now, it’ll be a good play into the 10-15 range. But as others have pointed out, I’m a smooth brain and just doing my best to watch out for the unsubstantiated hype. Some have made solid points for it. The action around this thread also makes me think there’s a hype train (unrelated to the fundamentals) behind it.",2,0,1614881553,wsrider03
45,gpohfwv,"Yeah I don't know what you're seeing, but we are at the tail end of a refi boom. There are still plenty of people holding 4% interest rates. In 2018/19 rates were at 5%. There was a dip back down to high 3's, which was the first ""boom"" and then a second boom when it dipped into the 2's. That's a huge amount of volume and increase to refi heavy lender's bottoms lines. 

UWM is not refi heavy or even refi focused. They opened a product to catch the refi business but stated they could not use that product if the original loan was a UWM loan. They wanted people to refi once at a super low rate and be done.

UWM's focus is fast close purchase business, which shows more stability than refi heavy avenues. The refi biz is drying up and those that have solely relied on cheap pricing will suffer. 

UWM was never the cheapest. Their selling points are leading edge technology, process automation, and speed. They want brokers to wow their realtor partners with a smooth, fast process. Not dragging a purchase through the mud for 45 days so the borrower gets a rate that saves them an extra $25/mo.",1,0,1614881923,enjoi8
