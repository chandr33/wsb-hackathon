5,gqgydqs,"Short laddering. Illegal but institutions are getting desperate praying for enough people to sell. This happened in first wave too. A LOT. Don't expect SEC to do anything.

If enough people holds, this practice backfires hard.

Short laddering can also cause gamma squeezes to work the other way. If you believe enough people will still hold regardless of the crashes, then you win out. If not, rip.

Not fazed by 150 drop. Itâ€™s market manipulation. Or a big sell that is currently all being bought up. Hedges are trying to get they shit back. Donâ€™t let them. Hold and we win. Literally dropped and weâ€™re back at open prices. Big strong ape kind we win if no sell...hold little ones",1,0,1615399352,lxgacyy
