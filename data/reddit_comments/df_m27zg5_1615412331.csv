5,gqhwlo8,"i mean, you're kinda retarded, but yeah they already do that. that's why every ticker does its little up down cha-cha all day every day.

but to answer your question seriously, the ""whatever price"" is just the last traded price, not the price you'll get if you try to buy 1000000 shares in a single drop. there might be only 1000 shares available to buy at 265, then another 1000 shares available at 269, then another 1000 shares at 288... 

same goes for the sell, and exactly why the short attacks work. if you try to sell 1000000 shares when the last traded price was 265, you'll first sell to the guys 1000 buy order at 265, then you'll sell another 1000 to the next buy order down at 250, then another 1000 at 232, then 1000 shares at 210, then 1000 shares at 199, and it just keeps going down eating up all the buy orders.

if you want to buy/sell a bunch without making the price swing a ton, you have to do it carefully throughout the day, letting the bid/ask spread balance back together.",2,0,1615412336,should-be-work
