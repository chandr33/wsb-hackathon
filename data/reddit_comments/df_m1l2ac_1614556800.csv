Billy doesn't know any other apes individual situation, and if your level of risk is acceptable then please only do what you said and drive that rocket higher for us all. 

  
Billy just wanted to point out a potential way to lengthen our stay on on the moon, whilst minimising sad apes, and not overly affecting the way we blast off and continue to moon!
