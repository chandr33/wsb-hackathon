So I use this broker called Futubull which has mainly Hong Kong users, their app also provides a comment section for each ticker so users can discuss the stock.



This user is called CHAR LEE and he hasn't shorted GME, but he did buy puts which was seeing red yesterday. I know this because the fool posted screenshot of his puts, which he apparently intended as a rallying cry for other put buyers or short sellers.


After being ridiculed on Futubull, he then posted a screenshot of him ""infiltrating the enemy HQ"" which is a comment on WSB saying Short Squeeze won't happen. Yep, his account is u/char1101g and the screenshot already showed his comment at -22 lol

30,gpleqkv,"I'm not calling them distractions, I was merely asking if you thought they were, hence the question mark. Before you call something a pump and dump, I'd suggest doing at least a little research to understand why it went up, 277% rise in net income along with a special 5% dividend. 

""Pump and dump is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price."" Nothing about the income increase is false or misleading. 

And this is the part where you mention that ""it lost 32% in one day which clearly shows it's a pump and dump"" while ignoring that GME has done the same thing multiple times. 

Yes dude, I'm obviously a shill, if you couldn't tell by my flair and my account age, I made this account a year before this whole fiasco because I just knew this was coming, I guess I can see the future.

THEY'RE TRYING TO DISTRACT US FROM A STICK THAT ISN'T EVEN OVER SHORTED ANY MORE

Don't get me wrong I bought into GME for $26 back in January and am still diamond handing like a champ but people need to get over the run foil hat stuff now. It WAS happening back when we were at war but now it's just a good stock that we like with less than 40% shorted, no real squeeze to force any more and therefore no reason for anyone to try and speak out attention like that had to previously.

Speaking of spreading our attention there IS a new play going on.. beyond even RKT. It's so good that we gotta say it twice (cos it makes a cool noise)..

&gt;What constitutes ""discussing"" the ticker in question? Have you run sentiment analysis to determine if the discussion is positive or negative?

It would be interesting to group account join dates by their sentiment buckets. For instance, it could be the case that the vast majority of newer GME ""discussers"" are people pushing others to sell GME while newer RKT ""discussers"" are pushing others to buy RKT.

You imply that because GME discussers are newer than RKT discussers, that would indicate that it's less likely that RKT discussions are from bots. But if negative sentiment GME accounts are the newer discussers of GME, that implication isn't as strong. I'm not saying it's one way or the other, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that correlating sentiment with account age would be an interesting metric to get a better, well-rounded picture.",1,0,1614818513,kmoney41
