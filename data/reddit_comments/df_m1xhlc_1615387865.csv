QUOTES AS OF 09:48:20 AM ET 03/10/2021  
09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.
