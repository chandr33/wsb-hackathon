19,gqdqwip,"GME is moving based on hype, options mechanics, manipulation, and is heavily shorted.  Most of the people involved in the first three are concerned in a way about the fourth.  

No one really knows whatâ€™s going to happen.   The peak of nearly 500 was based mostly on hype, but likely also an options squeeze, with some short squeeze involved.

Many believe they can push GME high enough to trigger the short contracts being force to cover which catalyze the price into rocketing up as a liquidity squeeze happens due to the heavy short interest that approaches more than stock available.  Basically people think a singularity of liquidity but also millions of forced buys will be triggered.  

Will it happen?  Who knows.  How fast will it be? Who knows.  It could turn into a 2 hour even where GME sky rockets to upwards of 1500 a share, maybe higher, maybe lower.  Then it might collapse down to 3-10 dollars a share slowly over a month or two as traders move on.  

Itâ€™s also worth noting that even though the individual share price seems very high relative to where it was, the market cap of this company with thousands of stores is only 15B.  Some speculate the new CEO can save the company. If thatâ€™s possible, it might actually be worth 500 a share, or more.  Who knows.

GME is a massive bucket of volatility because itâ€™s only worth 15B right now.  It can be moved much easier than many larger companies, and it is a battleground of hedge funds, retail, and a bunch of retards. Volume is very high.  

If you want to play GME know that you might buy and it might collapse 20% a day for a week and never come back.  Or it could moon 500% in the next month.  Very high risk.",3,0,1615328796,Imafish12
