Albertson's 
Wish
Square
And today I took my profits from investing in the Tesla dip and reinvested back in. 
And i decided to yolo on carvana stock. Probably gonna bite me in the ass.

Feel really good about Albertson's, Square, and Wish.
When the price is going down down but you see it trend back up in the last half hour ish I think you've got a bullish stock. Albertson's feels really safe. Wish is basically back down to when it was first added to cashapp. And if you're investing on cashapp you might as well have a chunk in $SQ considering how much money you'll give em.",1,0,1614719771,Ransom-ii
