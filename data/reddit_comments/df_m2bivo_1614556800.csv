9,gqi83tl,"In finance, it's just a thing and it's not a bad thing. I have to preclear all of my &amp; my spouse's trades. If you are a separate household, I believe you don't need to do that, but if you live with pops you do.

I also cannot buy &amp; sell same stock within 60 days, so I'm hoping this drags on! Sec required Diamond hands.",6,0,1615417723,danrennt98

31,gqj4stm,"I think you‚Äôre missing the point. 

The fraud the SEC is trying to prevent is your dad logging in to your brokerage accounts and pretending to be you while he makes trades that he himself are not allowed to make. 

It really has nothing to do with you personally other than compelling a family member to look the other way for a few minutes is usually easy.",1,0,1615435205,ChuckFina74
