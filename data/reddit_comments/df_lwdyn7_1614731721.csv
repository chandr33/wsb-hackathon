22,gphb1w9,"A different perspective:

In finance, there's a term called ""Moving Average Convergence Divergence"" which is also known by its abbreviation ""MACD"". Some finance folks view it as a ""trend-following momentum indicator that signals when a stock might be overbought or undersold"". Very basically, it's an indicator that it might be time to buy or sell a stock.
MACD. Like McDonald's. Hence the ice cream cone in Cohen's tweet.
Also, about that bullfrog...when a stock is about to cross from being oversold (aka it's time to buy), the chart colors go from purple to green, so people call it ""going froggy"".
