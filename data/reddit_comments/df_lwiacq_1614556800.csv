""Undervalued"". Maybe dudes. Maybe I'll miss out on lots of money.

But if you're a gun owner watching ammo prices you def wouldn't think everyone hasn't been watching these stocks since the start of last year.

If anything; I think gun and ammo sales will peter off with the lack of big news events like BLM/Covid shortages/Covid hitting manufacturing/Election year ended.

Democrats control alot, sure. And a Dem president boosts gun sales; but they were already super high. Dems have much more popular legislation to go after; and likely not enough of a majority to pass anything with guns.

I just don't see gun/ammo skyrocketing without a huge thing happening. Like federal magazine limits(unlikely), federal ban/restriction of AR style weapons(unlikely), economic depression, etc etc.",2,0,1614812835,TechnicianPlenty
