This is a different beats all together because it is a company making money as GME and AMC are not. Divided will be this month as well.

Fact here is it is profit making company where thousands of houseowners trusted and doing business.
There business model is less captial intensive ( they pass loan exposure ..) and high tech based. There loan origination  process is much more smoother than big banks..plus superbowl advt and WSB chatter making their marketing easier.

How about a compromise, RKT has NOTHING to do w GME.  the only thing they have in common is that both popped and were good investments.  I am curious though, does holding GME cause self absorbed paranoia?  Just to be helpful, not everything (actually almost nothing) is about GME or GME holders, not everyone is out to fuk GME holders (most of us don't care about them at all).  We honestly wish you the best of luck and all tendies you can take from the market, but none of this is about you or GME.

Back in the WSB days of yore, the top to the GME chain was 60, and it got annihilated resulting in a gamma squeeze the following week, maybe you heard about that. Plenty of reets dropped 2-3k on FD’s that Friday and walked away with a couple million or so because it closed in the high 70’s and the contracts cost them fuckall, like a 2-3 cents. The most interesting parallel to me about that week is that GME was trading in the 40’s on that Tuesday and crushed the chain ITM at 60 max.
