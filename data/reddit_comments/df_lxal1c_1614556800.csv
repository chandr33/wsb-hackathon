People have been talking about a RKT squeeze for months. Frankly I *still* don‚Äôt understand the exact dynamics because I always thought a squeeze could theoretically make sense given low float high short interest and dividend and had wondered why it didn‚Äôt happen. 

You‚Äôve learned entirely the wrong lesson. The right lesson is: 
**a TRUE short squeeze where hedge funds are forced to cover due to borrow recall is incredibly incredibly incredibly rare**
You can get a gamma squeeze. You can get a January short squeeze where hedge funds are losing money on both sides of their book and they have to cover because their NAV is declining while shorts are blowing up (they need to post more margin). But a situation where hedge funds *need* to cover because their stock is getting recalled is few and far between.
