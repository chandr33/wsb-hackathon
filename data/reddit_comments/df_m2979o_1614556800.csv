3,gqhwi3y,"The hedge funds also know that a lot of traders are putting in stop loss orders behind the market as it rises. That drop was, at least in part, engineered to trigger a whole bunch of those stops and get them out at lower prices. 

They didn't expect us to double down on the dip.",27,0,1615412294,KyOatey

8,gqhzhn2,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it looked like a selloff likely to rebalance a portfolio from what I watched.

When funds become overweighted in a particular equity's value they are compelled to sell so the whole thing doesn't take a big ol' shit. Believe it or not, some funds believe in their duty to investors and follow their risk plans

11,gqi0oki,"They underestimate our propensity for chaos. If I get rich off of this play, I benefit, my family benefits, my girlfriend gets grad school paid for. If they drive me back down to cost basis, I play this very long term instead. They're the ones with deadlines, interest fees and high margin hemorrhaging capital. My shares are going fucking nowhere until we're talking about thousands a piece.",1,0,1615414150,Macs675
