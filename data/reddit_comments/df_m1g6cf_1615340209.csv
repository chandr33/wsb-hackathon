I'm also eyeing up CINE. Definitely more risk than AMC but if they are solvent in July/August they are likely to bounce back bigger than ever.

In about 2018 they expanded aggressively making them the world's 3rd latest cinema chain, covering europe and N America. They tend to be profitable, but are currently sitting with a couple of billion in debt from the expansion that they can't shift thanks to Covid.
