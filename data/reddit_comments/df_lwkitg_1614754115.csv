Just like Government Volts now, just like .Gov NatGas cars from just a few years ago. Just like the Nat Gas cars from the 90's. Your Tax Dollars being flat-out wasted.

14,gpj1bds,"It already doubled last year and is flying way higher than the pre pandemic cliff. Which is why I‚Äôm a bit cautious about that number. That and their debt. Mary Barra seems great. Don‚Äôt know if they stuck a woman in there to be the fall guy when things were looking bad, but she‚Äôs really shown she can get things done IMO. They have a history of creating a lot of things that we now consider standard features in vehicles. I know they have good news lately and I‚Äôve always thought they were best poised to take advantage of the EV market. I‚Äôm ethically a fan of the plan to get rid of ICEs and when that happens and if credits for EVs equalize they will be on a more level playing field in that regard. They still have so many dealerships which are expensive and add to the vehicle price or eat at profits. Eliminating some divisions a few years back helped streamline but it‚Äôs still a big cost that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have. 

In all I‚Äôm a fan and have been holding for a while. I would love if you‚Äôre right. My money already doubled and this would make it go another almost 10x. Not super optimistic, but it would be nice.",2,0,1614776011,S99B88

It's also a dwindling resource, and we need to use it for better things than commuting to work and going to Walmart.

i basically predicted covid happening and hitting various sectors. then predicted rebound. got some wrong or i'd be up a lot more. 

trading is super hard, you're literally fighting with hedge funds and computers... but, I think it is beatable. as long as you dedicate a lot of time reading and thinking. trade only high conviction plays. and, don't foget to TAKE PROFIT. nobody went broke taking profit, and we live to fight another day.",1,0,1614838041,pinkmedmug
