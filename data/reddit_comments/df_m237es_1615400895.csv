The battle has been raging all day in the distance and I am unable to ascertain whether any thing has been gained or not. O how I long for this Great GME War to end. How I long for piece of tendie. How will I hail the day when I return to the sight of your mister rested upon thine bosom. O the humanity! O the horrors of hedgies! Truly it may be considered the most cruel and awful scourge which can befall a nation. Heaven grant strength to thy paper hands and give us this day our tendies.
