85,gqgc697,"**PREDICTION: Hedges / News networks / Bots going to SHILL HARD for KOS$** 
[Not going to mention any of the tickers here for the bots]


CNBC+ Reuters have been the favorite go-to misinformation spreaders for shorters. Whether its **$LV** or **Weed Stocks** or **N0KIA** or **Roket** or their latest favorite **KOS$**, news networks have been keen to group GME with other ""meme stocks"" and divert attention away from the one and only play **GME**. 

Today we saw KOS$ go up 40% in PRE-MARKET for NO REASON, when only large institutional players can usually trade. This is another one of their efforts to prime the new media for another potential distraction, saying there will be money to be made elsewhere than GME.
