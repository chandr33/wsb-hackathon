2,gqhgl5q,I’m not specifically talking about GME. I’m trying to get people to understand how much leverage WSB has currently and that will be taken advantage of no doubt. Not just by HFs but other more malicious actors like those who use online bots. And I think it’s pretty well known that MC had already recouped their losses- this isn’t about them or GME.,1,0,1615405456,LimpingWhale
