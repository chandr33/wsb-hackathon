0,gqhyl39,"In the long run you get used to it, especially when you realize gains before a crash a couple times and realize that playing it safe the way you have been was the right move.

Easier to recover from the mentality of some gains when could have mad gains than big loss when you could've had some gains

&amp;#x200B;

I say this as someone who almost bought 5k at calls that went up like 6000%+ a week later.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah TLRY and RKT I sold on the way up and actually made amazing gains, especially on RKT. If I held 100% rather than 15-20% I'd be at a loss rn.",2,0,1615413216,IFuckedUp_ALot
