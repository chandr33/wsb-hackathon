11,gqhbbtm,It went up buddy. No way you would sell bc it went down unless you are genuinely retarded.,1,0,1615403254,ibraibra66
12,gqhrbq0,"I've been fucking up ever since I bought in Jan 28th
Should have sold when it's spiked up to 500$
Should I drop my whole life savings after when it came to 40$
Should have cashed out at 350$ today
Should have bought in at 120$
Imagine if you did that all perfect? 
Instead I haven't made s*** lmfaoo",1,0,1615410034,calikid9one

14,gqhuln0,"That's your mistake, not mine. I am planning on selling the second it hits $400, I could care less if it hits even $1000, I haven't made much because I only put it what I can afford to lose. Never put in your life saving into anything, just because others are making money doesn't mean that you will as well. This is what scares me in the stock market. I began around the same time as you, put in $1,100 in. Invested in $SNDL at its peak and lost around $600. I then sold and bought 4 shares of $GME at $127 each. I recovered and have made $187 above the original $1,100 I put in. I didn't invest in $GME because of this subreddit, I only use this sub to check out the news and memes, nothing more. I always imagine if I had bought at a low and sold at a high, but that is nothing near a reality. My advice, do your research about each stock and not just 10 minutes, do thorough research about the stock(s) you plan to invest in and trust your gut. My dad always said don't be greedy and be grateful for what you get, so this is what pushed me past the $SNDL incident and stopped me from having negative emotions about it, I think of it as a learning experience. Good luck with your shit mate, cheers.",1,0,1615411472,ibraibra66
15,gqls3cg,"never said it was your problem, and I wouldn't drop my life savings ever. 

"" Trust your gut. My dad always said don't be greedy and be grateful for what you get""  ‚îÄ Wise words, I always get that feeling in my gut and I don't listen and get screwed cuz what I felt would happen would happen, or didn't happen.

I only have  5 GME shares on TD account and 6 on Webull.  Pretty much around 120$ bought avg.  And I was thinking to sell at 350$ and when it got to it, I didn't trust my gut and waited and it dropped to where it is now.    
But for sure going to listen to what I feel is right now.
