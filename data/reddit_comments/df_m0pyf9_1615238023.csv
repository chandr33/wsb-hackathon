I am seeing a surprisingly large amount of skepticism from liberals about the vaccine, people not wanting to get it. That's concerning. Nobody even knows how to get it yet the economy is pricing in that everything is going to go back to normal. People aren't gonna throw away their phones and go to bars and stop using tech.

It was a great platform when I was first starting out, but now that I have a 200k+ account and do 100+ contracts at a time there bid and ask spread filling is just way to shity. It's a great platform to start out on and if you do a few plays at a time you won't notice the spread filling difference to much, but now that I'm bigger I definitely feel it dude. 100 or 200 dollars lost just to fill orders is adding up and I'm sick of it now.
