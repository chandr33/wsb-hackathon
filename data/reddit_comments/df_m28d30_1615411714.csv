Sure, I don't see that many Americans and Europeans buying Nio, unless the cars are cheap and well-made. And no offense meant at all to anyone, but China doesn't have the best reputation in the West. Not yet at least.

But what matters is that the Chinese people will buy Nio. Even in the absolute worst-case scenario for Nio, where they fail to sell a single car overseas, there will be more Chinese car-buyers than car-buyers in the US and Europe combined. There might even be more Chinese car-buyers there than there are Americans or Europeans, period.
