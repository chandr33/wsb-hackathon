I am in the same boat as you. Have a decent job and just put a little under $400 into this when cost was $38. So- do I cash out at $500 and get $4k, or hold for more?

My rationale- I‚Äôve lost $400 in way worse ways over much shorter periods of time (making stupid roulette bets while blackout drunk, going to strip clubs,  etc). Looking back, those sucked at the time, but weren‚Äôt big enough losses to change the trajectory of my life. So- I can either cash out for less than a months salary, or hold and be a part of history.

They got burned by all of the illegal shit pulled by these billionaire assholes late January and now they‚Äôre out for blood. We‚Äôve seen their tricks. We know this squeeze is going to be cataclysmic. Anything under the multiple thousands is trolling.

Those who entered late last time north of 200, cannot have many stocks simply because it gets very quickly to crazy money.

I don't see bad at all that somebody with an average of 300 sells off all or part of their stock if we hit 500, each stock (both at buy and sell price) is serious rent-pay money and they have a much thinner margin to make profit than others.

13,gqbk19s,Not financial advice but IMO 400 is low. It's organically worth that right now.. IMO will sustain trading well above that post squeeze years. This is called risk aversion.

14,gqbk6el,"Just my opinion/thoughts, not financial advice: 

Identify the source of the paying stock buyer during a squeeze.

HF:  they wont go above 500, because if they shorted  at any time, it would have been for 500 or less, so to eat their losses would be to just buy back the borrowed share at what they borrowed or for, less interest.

MM: these guys will just need stock now that 200 calls are ITM, adding 30k contracts to be covered.  This is where, if anywhere, the above $500 a share will come from when they need to buy.

I expect quite a few bag holders to break even or small profit at first opportunity,  and I dont blame em.  It's not often you get to break even after bag holding at 300+ a share for 2 months.",1,0,1615293232,Disposable_Canadian
