0,gph6fg0,Iâ€™m guessing the premium went up by the time market opened and they were never going to fill today,16,0,1614729997,schlongconnery4
1,gph6it2,"Pretty much the underlying skyrocketed from the opening bell and the premiums never got close to that cheap again would be my guess. Next time, 10-15 minutes after market opens open your pending order and see how far the premiums have changed, you still could have probably gotten in cheap had you looked",6,0,1614730045,tremendous_machine
2,gph6kme,this is exactly what happened. never buy options  AH,6,0,1614730071,WholeTit
3,gph6mvu,Probably. Putting in options buy orders outside of trading hours can be risky since they wonâ€™t fill until the next day.,4,0,1614730104,ancillarycheese
4,gph6nkk,"You can only purchase options during regular trading hours. 

With the pre market price movement the premium on the options would have changed before the market opened.",3,0,1614730114,landof8

7,gph6ts2,RKT is a distraction from AMC BB NOK etc. BE WARNED. There is whole ass corny propoganda about this company. Itâ€™s not Rocket. Itâ€™s a great way to get RKT.,-3,0,1614730200,personaanongrata
8,gph6x5o,I messed up on my calls too on this one. I ordered 10 calls for next Friday and 20 for April 1st. I can swear I kept the April one but apparently I cancelled it. ðŸ˜£was hoping to pay my mortgage with the company that owns it. They were barely a little over a buck yesterday. Now itâ€™s insane.,2,0,1614730248,BC122177

11,gph7799,"Queued market orders always go through the next day at market open IF, the premium that you queued them for is still the same price at opening which in this case was not because, the price of the stock went up in AH and pre market",1,0,1614730392,poloven

17,gph9mxp,"Can't buy options afterhours and in tickers that move in price before opening the option price moves so they will never get filled.

Better to wait until opening, and if it's a stock like RKT another of times you'll need to replace the order to get it filled even during normal trading hours.",1,0,1614731640,darksoulmakehappy
