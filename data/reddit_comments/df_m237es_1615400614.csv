21,gqh4r41,"Panic sold at loss. Panic bought at 260. I'm not meant for this. Carry on everyone else. This is draining me mentally.

Edit: thanks everyone I've gotten a lot of support in literally minutes and I feel a lot better. I didn't lose a life changing amount. Basically my stop loss was triggered by that huge fucking crash. I'm not giving up on stocks and GME has been fun. Going to turn off my phone for a while. Might buy back in after but I need a break. Love you guys.

Edit 2: FUCK IT. Bought back in. Not looking at it until Friday. Not going down without a fight.",45,0,1615400618,flam_drags
