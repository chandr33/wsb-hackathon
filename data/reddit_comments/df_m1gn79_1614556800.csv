Cant wait for the data. However, market usually doesnâ€™t respond well to earnings especially after a crapandemic year, but I donâ€™t think it will matter much. We arenâ€™t selling (yet).",13,0,1615325079,superheroninja

5,gqdj9d9,"Are we expecting a good, profitable quarter? 

Iâ€™m asking because where I live, ps5 only had initial hype but that lasted a month at most then quickly died down.

It seemed like a low supply, high demand (initial) and lack of games issue (not sure if itâ€™s still the case)


Of course Iâ€™m speaking based on my impression of sales, so if someone knows more than I do could chime in thatâ€™d be great.",2,0,1615325274,Mathownsme

9,gqdk2r6,"It's still ""back order"" after 4 months.  Like the minutes new stock arrive, it's sold out.

So we just need to know how much they had order new consoles and we already know they sold them all.

Maybe checking best buy report, to ""guess"" how much GME could had order ?   But there is still some sub-reddit dedicated to help people to pre-order new console lol",5,0,1615325639,Freequebec86

11,gqdoxpa,"Only concern on that is the huge supply problem with both PS5 and Xbox. I'd imagine that's limited sales, however last gen was still selling well at a relatively high price point up until launch so maybe that will help balance it out.",1,0,1615327862,AndyOfTheInternet

13,gqdpb3a,"Demand is clearly outstripping supply but it seems that supply is severely limited (GPU chip shortage i believe). That being said, GME's price is less about traditional fundamentals and more about the fact it appears over shorted to the point theres just piles of money on the table.",2,0,1615328036,AndyOfTheInternet
