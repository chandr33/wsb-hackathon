0,gpomz9p,"This is such a stupid fucking post dude. Stop treating the market like some social class warfare issue, that's why you'll lose all your money. Emotional trading never works. You say you don't care to lose now, but when you actually do you'll feel exactly opposite. 

Trade based off your thesis, not off this bullshit sjw bs. Also, Melvin posted a 20% return this month, they're not in GME anymore.

To all those retards calling me a bot, I sold my PSTH to buy GME at 60 before the first pump, check my post history.",6,1,1614884240,PenilePasta

2,gpooaqs,"Citadel didn't proliferate MBS, that was from SIFIs like Lehman who were packaging them and selling off the risk to third parties. The 2010 Volcker Rule (Section 619 of Dodd-Frank) made it illegal for banking institutions to own or invest in HFs as well so the likelihood of a fund doing anything to ""people like you"" is not significant.

Sometimes opportunities just need to be capitalized and don‚Äôt always seem like opportunities. For me, it was taking promotions without pay increases.
