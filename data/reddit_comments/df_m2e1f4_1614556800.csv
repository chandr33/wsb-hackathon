12,gqin6wn,"Look up their past dividendsâ€”they hover around .40-.50. Highly unlikely theyâ€™ll keep the same % as the price goes up. However, theyâ€™re a solid passive income option as theyâ€™ve kept their dividend payout (albeit reduced in some quarters) for the last decade. I think itâ€™s a very undervalued company in an underperforming sector. This is a bullish LT, but like your title suggests, itâ€™s no GME.",1,0,1615425640,acutelittlekitty

16,gqiorhz,"So there are some pretty good reasons as to why you might not seen prices go back up.


First, the effect of covid is likely going to be different than other recessions. All that stuff you hear about WFH and Zoom? It likely is not going to reverse  100%. Some people are definately going to cone back to the office, but definately not everyone. Right now we are likely still in a bit of a honeymoon (if you could call it that). Lets start by looking at 1 year leases, like most residential leases. We are just barely a year into lockdown, so even if companies moved online or WFH at the begining of the pandemic, they would just now be coming up on lease renewals. More likely, most of those are still months out as businesses may have still renewed last march/apr/may given the uncertainty and hope that lockdown would be quick. However, it gets worse, a lot of corporate/business leases have longer terms, sometimes 5, 10, or even 20 years. Now, this gives a bit of stability, or even a current cash infusion (if a customer buys out their lease), but long term you are looking at more companies not renewing, renewing smaller spaces, or negotiating lower rates. All of these things are likely to put downward pressure on rent prices (and therefore revenue projections).


In addition, the first wave of corporate office jobs leaving will likely create a ripple effect. It isnt just that Amazon rents a huge amount of space, but all those workers need lunch, services and transportation. When the white collar workers leave, restaurants and service industry will be hit hard as well, so restaurants will close, or downsize and create yet another wave of lower revenue.


Lower revenue is bad, but not that bad right? Imagine if Ford sells a whole bunch fewer cars (which it probably did), some of that lost revenue is going to be offset by lower COGS. Ford didnt gave to buy as many raw materials, they maybe laid people off and saved wage expense. 


In real estate though, almost all your costs are going to be fixed. You still need security, still need heat and utilities, you still have to pay mortgage and property taxes. In some cases, expenses may actually increase after tenents vacate becaus many corporate leases are ""triple net"", which means the tenet pays most expenses, but if the tenent leaves, the landlord is stuck with the bill.


You also mentioned interest, interest is *interesting*. (yes I meant to). It usually amounts to a material expense n most real estate companies. Low rates are generally great for real estate, when the economy drops, real estate firma can refinance at a lower interest rate and cash in on a bunch of savings, so that is good news right?


Well, lets remember, interest rates have been low for a LONG time, since 2008. They never really came back up due to the federal reserve's quantitative easing and the fact the economy never really got ""hot"". Sure there may be some minor savings, but chances are that refinancing mortgages isnt going to be cutting down on expenses in material ways. On top of that, we have actually seen interest rates rise in the last few weeks on tye fear of inflation due to stimulus, so debt is actually getting MORE expensive, not less.


Now, this is not to say that real estate is not underpriced, it may be. However, the downside risk is that the flow of jobs back into city centers is not as strong as the flow out, and real estate companies need to operate much much more efficiently and leaner.


You can see this in dividends. You mention %, but the real  numbers are important here. Back before COVID Invesco was paying 50c a share/qtr. That amount is now at 8c, but was at 2c. That means that cash flow has been severely restricted. They literally are paying out less than 20% of what they were before. On top of that, it looks like invesco is selling more shares, diluting ownership and cashflow rights even more. It looks like they are selling just over 20 million compared to about 460m shares currently outstanding. That means that even if Invesco gets back to disteibuting the same amount of cash as before (unlikely) then you would only be getting 48c a share (someone may want to double check the math, im on my phone). So you should expect a lower than historical dividend, potentially much lower.


On top of that, a big consideration is that most reit dividends will be ordinary income, even if you have held it for &gt;1 year, so no tax prefferred treatment.


Again, I am not saying its not underpriced, but that there is still substantial downside risk, which is likely priced into the share price. Chances are there are a lot of investors looking for signs to estimate how much rent prices will be affected as people return to work. Best case is that long term rents have been renogiated lower and revenues suffer for the next decade as those rates are locked in.",2,0,1615426458,illachrymable
