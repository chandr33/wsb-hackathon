60,gqduxup,AMC was climbing steadily alongside GME &amp; BB back in January. It dropped hard at the same time and has since been climbing back up slowly.

Another theory is that Amazon might be interested in buying up the theater chain in order to bring their Prime movies straight to the big screen (bigger profits and eligibility for film awards).,1,0,1615330716,barranquitas
