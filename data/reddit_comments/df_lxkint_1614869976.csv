34,gpnpvil,"So with ssr active shorts won't be able to plummet the price down. They can only short on upticks. The reason why we want this is because it makes it alot easier to get more contracts in the money when options expire Friday.

We don't really know whether these contracts are covered or not and are hoping they are not covered completely. Options sellers would need to buy shares off the open market to fulfill their side of the contract.

At this point where hoping for a gamma squeeze or chain reaction of option sellers and hedge funds buying more stock to hedge their bets, rinse and repeat.",1,0,1614869992,Gnargoyles
