3,gpptyq5,"I read the patent and they contradict themselves a bit. This patent is from February 2020....and is poorly written and any movement in price would already be accounted for by now.

 They state in the background that human to human transmission is possible, but very limited. They then go on to say ""pandemic"" in another section. Kind of hard to have a pandemic if human to human transmission is very limited. Also, in the summary they discuss that a method of treatment by administering the vaccine to the subject (in need thereof). When you dig in, that's not what the text describes. 

The guys behind the science are brilliant. The science is sound. But, fortunately, the need for the vaccine doesn't exist. Also, their examiner/patent preparer sucks. They need their money back.

So... this startup with brilliant people are focusing on patents for things no one needs in the hope that something happens and they can strike it rich... sort of. 


Puts on Inovio. They are wasting time and money.
