3,gqgcpo1,"You're misunderstanding that sentence. Institutions manipulate stock prices to keep them under certain thresholds, there is more of that in ASO at a below analyst price target than there was at any point in GME except for the first run up. The institutional influence and the short interest are two different things, as you can see in your quote as they are two different sentences. Literally if you have any experience in finance look at the daily volume and price and compare it to the thresholds.",0,0,1615389884,USAG1748

What else could this mean other than saying the SI is 40%",0,0,1615390049,liuthemoo
5,gqgdh7h,"I don't understand your argument. Read the entirety of the quote in your comment. Yes, the original ""SI"" of GME was over 100%, it's close to 40% now. ASO's is also about 40%. Neither of those have much to do with the institutional influence holding down ASO, they are two different things. I don't see what you don't understand here.",0,0,1615390226,USAG1748
6,gqge9gm,"You're trying to push the argument that the ASO short squeeze will be even greater than GME's, which is blatantly false. The other point you brought up in your DD was fine, and 40% is a very high short interest percentage, but you completely ruin any semblance of trust and alienate readers of your DD who have at least a basic understanding of the topics being discussed by making the false claim that this is somehow going to overshadow GME's short squeeze.",-1,0,1615390577,liuthemoo
7,gqgeg0f,"Lockup period of 15.6 million shares (out of 88 million outstanding) is expiring on 3/31. Need to be careful. If these shares get held, that's obviously very bullish, but I'm always hesitant to get in before a large lockup expiration.",1,0,1615390658,fattaco
8,gqgfaym,"That's not the argument that's being made here. While I do believe there is potential for a short squeeze, my argument here is that there is more institutional game playing. What don't you understand about that? Also, I'm literally a lawyer in the realm of finance and have degrees in finance and economics, you can look at my post history. Your post history is minecraft and r/teenager, why do you believe you have any understanding of literally anything finance related?",-1,0,1615391031,USAG1748

16,gqhehdi,"I appreciate the heads up. I was aware, and probably should have mentioned in the DD. My hope is that a drive up will occur before earnings. I hopefully will not be holding my options until April, even though I believe long run this is a $3X+ stock.",2,0,1615404565,USAG1748
17,gqhniux,"I think your DD is fine other than not mentioning this; however, based on historical lockup periods, this event will likely cause some sell side pressure. 

I will dabble in afterwards, since Dicks is losing customers for being idiots and those customers are gonna go somewhere to spend their stimmy checks on guns. I agree mid/long term this company is pretty good.",1,0,1615408430,fattaco

Now that Trump is out and the vaccine is out, things are going to start calming down and going back to normal.

Also, if Biden attempts any gun regulations, which two bills are being worked on right now, sales will skyrocket. Look at the Obama era gun sales. Back to normal is actually good for ASO as school sports are a huge money maker.

32,gqkg0hg,"Dicks is not a well run department store, and whether you sgree with their decision to stop sellimg ammo or not, gun and ammo buyers spend a lot of money. That's lost revenue for them (and likely gained revenue for ASO).

You'll hear anecdotal stories here from people from the south about how no one they know shops at Dicks anymore, instead they are going to ASO. In a zero sum game, Dicks is a loser, and ASO is a winner. 

Tldr Dicks and their upper management are idiots.",1,0,1615467099,fattaco
