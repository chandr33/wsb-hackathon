7,gppe01o,No one knows because it's being handled in a completely new way. We're now following japan's model wich prevents inflation on common goods but does cause inflation in the stock market. This is done by the government buying up bad debt and bailing out companies and the result is stock prices go way up. So far it's been working but it does make the wealth gap grow. The biggest threat to it is a revolution by those being left behind.,41,0,1614895668,PeacefullyFighting

20,gppgl85,"&gt;The only way we get inflation is if the banks open their doors and start lending to everyone right now (which they won't, given the current unemployment rates). So all this QE money will stay locked away within the banks and stonk market (unless the GME bubble super pops!) until further notice. This also causes a dollar shortage (see M2 velocity &amp; remember companies not accepting dollars &amp; banks not issuing dollars last year?), which will also lead to a dollar rally and will cause yields to drop (and the stonk market).

Posted above OP. Inflation is caused by money flooding the economy after a long period of saving. If unemployment stays high and jobs don't come back like expected, it means banks will continue to be hesitant with lending to a large swath of the population. This is why Biden et al keep talking about vaccinations and economy opening back up and jobs coming back. 

Then you also have to consider other events - if people don't have their jobs back many can/will go homeless. Those that owe rent when the moratorium ends will be forced out of their abodes. As assistance programs end, it means people that didn't have money to begin with will be capable of spending even less.",10,0,1614896851,ProcessMeMrHinkie

So if money is being “hoarded” so to speak - less ending overall - the value of each dollar goes up.

Edit: I think you actually said this in another comment, “people hold onto cash’s no wait to buy goods with expectations of cheaper prices in the future”. Yet again, not claiming anything but this being a factor. With lots of money tied in investments and the market etc each dollar actually moving around is able to be worth more.

51,gppmyht,"You buy a bond from the government with a guarantee that at the end of x number of years, you will be returned your money plus a fixed interest rate.  Bonds really do only go up, but their interest rates aren't that great.  If stocks were a one night stand with a prostitute, bonds are like having an arranged marriage with an Amish girl; the sex will be guaranteed but you may have to do it through a hole in a sheet and it will be the exact same for the next 10 to 20 years.  It's the governments job to make bond interest rates attractive enough that you'll choose their stability over stocks, but not so attractive that they lose a ton of money if the market crashes.  They have to continue putting out even if the world is on fire.  The government banks on the fact that in the short term, they can put your money to good enough use that in the long term they have more than enough to pay you back.

Stocks are attractive because they offer us the opportunity for faster gains but there's a chance they handcuff you to a bed and steal your wallet.  Bonds are kind of plain looking and boring but they'll stand by you through thick and thin.

A retirement account will generally start with more stocks and less bonds in the beginning because you want higher rate of return, but will change to mostly bonds near retirement because they have a lot less risk.  You wouldn't want a market crash to wipe out your retirement fund when you are close to retirement.  So your retirement account should party hard and get its dick wet however it can when it's young but should settle down with something more stable in its old age.

60,gppp32r,"Well, think of it this way. We're a debt based society, meaning that we're hoping the value of our economy grows faster rate than the interest rates on our debts. So the economy fundamentally relies on people pulling out more and more debt to keep our growth moving. The more people/governments pull out new loans, the larger our monetary base grows (a.k.a. money printing) becomes relative to our economic value (I guess related to GDP). From my understanding, the H.8 data, M1 and M2 data show the big picture of government/consumer spending (a.k.a. more loans = bigger money supply = inflation)
https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS

So, who loans out money? Banks! Now, if you were had lots of money to lend out, would you be lending to normies right now? Nope, too much risk for defaults with super low interest rates. So, banks aren't lending until things get back to ""normal"". If you look at the H.8 under the consumer loans parts, you can see that less people are pulling out loans right now and are paying down debt (a.k.a. the money supply is flat or slightly decreasing). So if less people are pulling out loans for new cars, less cars will be built in the future and people lose jobs because of profit losses, etc...
Here's our consumer loan growth. The spikes are when the banks tighten and loosen loan requirements:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CONSUMER/

So, coming back to QE and stimulus, the government pulling out loans and giving the money to citizens (stimulus) to spur lending (kind of to get around bank lending restrictions for us). While the FED is taking treasuries and mortages back securities off the banks books in case people massively default and to ensure the banks have solid securities to lend against going forward. In turn, the FED is giving the banks cash for ""liquidity"", but eventually the FED will need its cash back in full, so the cash is locked within the banking system (this when the FED tried to pull out in 2018 and the market shit the bed). However, the FED is forcing the banks to buy treasury securities each month in order to keep the QE going. When banks buy bonds, the interest rates on bonds go down, which generally makes interest rates on loans go down (a.k.a. spur lending for businesses). The problem with all this is that the USD is tied to treasury securities and from my understanding, the more buying the FED does, the more it puts downward pressure on interest rates and sucks up dollars from the economy. 

So, finally, when we come back to the M2 Velocity, you can see that the dollar only exchanges hands 1.13 times before it's destroyed (if it were 1.0 it means I pull out a loan and immediately pay it off without spending it). So that indicates people aren't spending money and are paying down debt (deflation) or sitting on cash right now (stagnation).
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V

So the TLDR: So, a good chunk of inflation and deflation actually comes down to when the banks decide to lend again. Banks lending = inflation, banks not lending = deflation. Currently banks have restrictive lending and people are sitting on cash or paying off debt if they can, which are both deflationary in a debt-based society.
