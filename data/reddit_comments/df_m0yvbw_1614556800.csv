3,gqamykf,"For all of human history, land use, building design, and community planning has been based on available technology and the concept of affordability. With this plan, we will quickly usher in the so called 'age of abundance' where affordability will mainly refer to physical/environmental concerns rather than financial.

Imagine how we will design cities, neighborhoods, and housing differently when financial affordability is no longer a limitation. I encourage architects worldwide to go ahead and start designing the highest quality and most resilient habitats imaginable. Visualize them. Promote your best ideas to humankind across social media. Inspire us all. And may your creations serve humankind well for centuries, both on this Earth and beyond.",1,0,1615264841,NathanielRyanH
