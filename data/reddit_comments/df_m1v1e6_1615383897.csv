7,gqg0bhr,How many are bots? Genuinely I am a very avid gamer and I literally do not know one person that has played or let's their kids play it. I also tend not to hang out with people that would make such choices but regardless. Roblox has over 2 billion active accounts. That alone tells me they have a botting problem. So cool my kid can get on a game watch another character strip dance then get spammed to buy currencies from bots. But hey they say they have active users so it's all good I'll just dump money into the company. c'mon dood,1,0,1615383902,chubbycanine
