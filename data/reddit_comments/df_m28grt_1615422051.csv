36,gqiibp5,"this is fucking illegal tho. No idea how tons of hedge fund workers are not in jail right now. I mean I have pretty good diamond hands. I bought at $150 a few weeks ago and held even through the dip till $85. You know I was already fantasizing about my future when it was crossing heavily into the $300's and then guess what. It gets halted 4 times.

Ended up panick stop lossing at $190, which got executed at $185........... I put initial sell order at like 230 when it got halted around 240 but that didn't got executed as well (yeah stock market is not rigged....)

Like I know this meme is pretty common to make fun of ''paper hands'' but rationally looking at this, when institutions cause for a stock to be halted 4 TIMES IN 20 FUCKING MINUTES, LOSING 40% OF IT'S VALUE then yeah I just did not know what to do. It might as well have gone to $100 today. And psychologically I couldn't imagine losing money after all after such a rough ride of mine (bought at $150, held through $85, and then it was $343) so I was like fk it I ain't losing money on the trade so that's why I did this stop loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't worry apes, I did rebuy at $237 after the first halt after it increased from this crash.

Also, I could have also been a pussy ass paper hands and put a stop loss after the first halt (from $330 to $300 in 1 second) and I didn't.

Like I am not some spoiled rich kid who can just throw away his parents money or invest for memes. I come from an average family and it would just be so nice if I can finance my bachelors and maybe even masters degree from GME profits.

to the fucking moon boys, when I will have nice gains to finance university studies, I will name a compound in the future after the stock (I study molecular life sciences, so maybe I discover some cool drug later).",3,0,1615423045,TheGozd

The dip was a sell off of 1.27 mil shares I believe, and I was watching the order book as it happened and as soon as it happened thousands of orders came through for $203.50 which was about $140 less than the peak, so they sold 1.27 mil shares, bought 1.1 mil shares immediately. What I don‚Äôt understand is why it didn‚Äôt slingshot back up with the 1.1 mil buys @ $203.50. If 1.27 mil was enough to drop it $140, why wasn‚Äôt 1.1 mil enough to raise it back at least 7/8 of the way. With the assumption .17 mil was stop losses. And also, if they sold/shorted that many. And possess the 1.1 mil shares again, what‚Äôs to stop them from doing it over and over and running it into the ground. I wish I wasn‚Äôt retarded.",12,0,1615423169,Tyrant-Tyra

I was thinking the same thing. The quick drop + the Yahoo article that dropped about 30 min or less after it started to dip was a dead giveaway. Whoever triggered it knew there were a lot of stop limits set for that price point so they inflated it until it got there and then scooped up the automatically sold shares.
