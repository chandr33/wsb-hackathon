On the morning of January 25 (the day GME began going parabolic), I took several screenshots of the opening price.

4:47 am = $113.00 per share

5:09 am = $105.00 per share

9:29 am = $98.40 per share

10:21 am = $114.17 per share

10:36 am = $123.64 per share

10:44 am = $142.98 per share

10:47 am = $159.09 per share

What‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make? This morning (March 10)  at 4:50 am, GameStop hit a high of $295.00 per share. It is now down about $30 from those highs. DONT WORRY THOUGH!
