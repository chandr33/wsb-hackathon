11,gqkh3xh,"Alright u/zimmah there's 1 reason I don't believe in the 100k number and that reason is a question I cannot get answered anywhere, so let's see if you can change my opinion in something you posted here in your DD:   Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) 

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but if we start at 50m shares, and they short 50m (borrow to SELL) someone is buying those shares. so as much as 50m was the market availability now 100m shares are held until they're bought back. you cannot sell a share and nobody buy it? If that's the case then \^ in this example, 100m shares are held and 50m need to be returned. going at the minimum 200% would mean 100m shares shorted from the initial 50m, so 150m are held and 100m need to be bought back. If you have 1k shares, the HF borrows them and sells to me, we both have 1k shares for a total of 2k but they only need to cover 1k, we can't both sell our full 1k back to them for 100k because they only need half that amount.",1,0,1615467830,herbyfreak

I just have such a hard time really feeling it and buying into that.  I'm trying I'm reading every link and DD I can and I admit I don't understand all the maths fully (yet) and on top of that I don't think the corrupt broken US financial system would allow it to get that high or out of hand without the suits getting a bail out and the rest of us little fella's left empty bag handed wishing we would have got out at $500 ya know?   

&amp;#x200B;

So here I sit still without a plan of what I""ll do when it does MOONSHOT.  I think there are a lot of us around here - noobs with good intentions and money to invest and have been investing like myself trying to help the cause and earn some tendies, that don't really know how or when to sell some to at least make a few bucks (hopefully enough to cover investment and keep a bunch still in play).  Any ideas or thoughts or maybe you'll get it from this post or website or link for a short busser like myself?    Good luck today and may your bets turn green!",1,0,1615468267,BitOfIrish

14,gqkhwyd,"Thank you!! This kind of post cannot be reposted enough. This is the math that hardens hands to diamond.

I don't have hope in this, I don't have faith in this; I have knowledge of this. As a retail investor holding strong, *I* have the power.

15,gqki608,"&gt;It is the same thing.  You could have $350k in your hand with the click of a button.  Then you would be faced with whether to reinvest it at the current level or say buy Tesla at the current level.

I'm not sure what you're saying.  If they bought in at $350 they could have had $350k in their hand by just not buying in at such a silly price.  But if they bought in at $40 then sure, now would be a great time to get out but even if they mess around and let it drop all the way to $80 they still double their money.

&gt;If you wouldn’t put in $350k today then pull it out and leave in whatever you would put in at the current level. Everything else is speculation.

That's what keeps me out.  I want in on the action but there's no way I'm paying $350 for a stock that's worth maybe 1/10th of that.  Same with AMC, I'd like to be in on the action but the company is dead and just doesn't know it yet.  No way I'm paying $10 for a company with no future.  People on here talk about how much money they're going to make when people can go to the theatres again and that could be but that has nothing to do with the stock price.

&gt;You are still ripping the hedge funds off by doing so. You have no idea how many of the posts here are bots telling people to stay in so they can sell off. Why did it shoot up from $50 all the sudden 2 weeks ago? You think retail did that or was it someone who stands to 5-10x their money based on knowing the hype train will pile on.

Absolutely.  Personally I think this whole short story is a bunch of nonsense.  Stories from how things worked decades ago.  Today there are no guys with big egos on the phone making buys.  There are algorithms doing their thing.  Some algos might have overcommitted into short positions and left themselves exposed to an event they were never trained on but they also learned from the previous action and are making money now.  They probably learned that with GME and AMC they can bump the price and get the price to jump.  I suspect the massive dip yesterday was them dumping most of their positions after they determined they'd gotten all they could out of it.

&gt;I have paper hands like a bitch last time but I was using house refinance money that I couldn’t afford to lose so I had no choice, this time is using a more practical amount, I’m already up several months salary so that’s something.

Sounds like you're doing better than nearly everyone here.  Just make sure you take some of those gains out for your other projects and don't get tempted to risk them again.  Remember the line from Wolf of Wallstreet: ""we don't give back gains"".

&gt;Feel free to hold all you want but please don’t buy any more, it could go to $100 tomorrow.

If the volatility would drop a bit I'd be buying calls at $90.  I expect it to hit less than $50 before months end.",1,0,1615468500,nicheComicsProject

27,gqktin1,"I just checked my S3 account and it shows interest at 11.28m up from 11.18m the day before. 

After reading the Forbes article, I think either institutions have sold but not disclosed or short interest is still in the 30m range. Otherwise with institutions still holding 122%(Yahoo/Morningstar), insiders holding 27%, and then retail, we’d have to be at over 140% minimum which means closer to 30m should be the absolute lowest it can be IF the Yahoo institutional data is accurate. 

However, even NASDAQ only updated with Dec 31 forms last I saw so if institutions are down to just 90%, the current short interest would make sense.",1,0,1615474513,brizzybrew
