Our heroic primate - battered, yet not beaten - emerges from beneath the heap, a plume of dust, ash, and rock tumbling down his strong, silver back. He steps out from the pile, stomping nimbly toward the gathered hedges. He devours a banana. He chews a crayon. Finally, in an act of defiance, he chomps a TENDIE whole, spitting it back in Melvin's face, bellowing as the chewed up chicken showers the HF's face.*

1/28- price drop from $370 to $125 - total volume traded on the slide \~5.8million shares.

I reckon the shorting parties (probably HFs, could be MMs too) need upto 3days to place orders for \~6million shares without the price going bonkers).

They might try this again on Friday to keep the shares under $300 - $300 calls OI is \~7k (just for that strike price). So it makes sense they want it under $300 this week.
