0,gqh633q,"They have to **buy** shares to cover.  Millions of them.  They can't do that by shorting the stock, and the shares they borrowed are just *additional* shares they need to cover.

They need the price to go down.  A pump and dump is a scheme where you artificially *inflate* the price of the stock.  Their only hope would be if we all get scared and sell when they make the price drop... but we're already back above 270 lmao",1,0,1615401132,Ozwaldo
