4,gqcmhcm,"That's a great question. It's an important question. Thanks for asking it. As I said in my opening statement, I appreciate you inviting me here to talk about this today. It's something that hasn't been discussed enough in my opinion. In conclusion, we're out of time.

12,gqd05lc,"If this wasnt a squeeze, id agree with you. Since this is a blackswan event, i say youre completely wrong and ill sell on our returning flight

This is good advice for working the markets. Horrible advice for playing a squeeze

I rather ride this out and see how far it goes",2,0,1615316785,Shwiftygains
13,gqd09d6,Hell yeah. Appreciate the dissenting opinion. How much are you holding?,2,0,1615316832,Ragnaroktogon
14,gqd15f8,"Holding more than ive ever held in my life. But everything i put in I built up within a year. Which was also more than ive ever had to my name. Somehow losing it all doesnt bother me as it normally would at any other point in my life. 

And even if i miss the peak or if the peak is nowhere its projected to go, i still averaged down enough that i believe ill still be in profits post squeeze. I dont anticipate selling my full position unless we reach galactic levels and ill still probably hold a few then",2,0,1615317234,Shwiftygains

16,gqdt2ah,"What I want to know is if I handed some wallstreet dick 10K what's the probability of any random schmuck (trained non-ape) turning that into 100K and how quickly? If so, what's the requisite knowledge?

Like, if I locked the douchebag in a room (hypothetically) and tied him to a chair (hypothetically) and told him he's got a 10K check, shit me 100K worth of shares, options whatever in order to survive (hypothetically) - is that a thing?

I can't figure out if I'm actually retarded or just really unlucky so I'm trying to search for the knowledge gaps that need filling. Seeling a lot of ""I started with ~8k and now I have ~95k posts"" and haiving major FOMO",2,0,1615329819,overtmind
