9,gphopyv,"RKT CEO is jump starting the squeeze. The board introduced a special dividend of $1.11/share to be paid to everyone holding RTK stock on 3/9. Shorts, on the other hand, will have to pay $1.11 per every share they short on 3/9",9,0,1614739433,EastHornet6583

27,gphxruc,I checked out RKT at market open and wanted to buy some calls so I decided to wait until the end of trading that day. I set an alarm to buy RKT calls 5 minutes before market close then took a nap and slept through my alarm. I’m a fucking autist.,2,0,1614744169,Cheddar128

30,gphzlvs,"The more money I make across the board along with the rest of these degens, the more capital there is to throw at GME. Also the odds of seeing a HF get a legitimate margin call is extremely low. Wins across the board are important man, don’t be a one trick pony. I think today was likely the end of this play personally, but take a look at the amount of people here bagging 5 digits plus on RKT. That is ultimately a win, whether it’s to push the bar higher on GME or the next play.",3,0,1614745225,Conscious_Example661
