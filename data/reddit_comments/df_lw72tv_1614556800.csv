9,gpfn4yi,"It means we can’t give you financial advice, because we’re retards who eat crayons. If you believe in the stock and/or trust the DD you’re seeing around, it’s not too late to jump in.

Invest what you’re willing to lose for an unguaranteed chance at a gain. It’s called wallstreet**bets** for a reason.",3,0,1614705312,DoubleClickMouse
10,gpfn6lb,Just make sure you set a stop lose work out how much you willing to lose befare you enter your postion you dont want to be sitting there at -80% thinking about it after the fact.,4,0,1614705332,randysailer

13,gpfncb4,"Any price over $40 is FOMO stock is straight volatile do it if you want but there’s money to be made elsewhere. Just keep in mind at any time the stock could drop to 40. There’s never any real consolidation, I feel like most of the retail volume is young people new to investing who paperhand it once they lose 5%

I’ll get downvoted because after what happened in the end of January wayyyyyy more people with no experience subscribed to this sub and just screech about GameStop all day to be in on the meme.",1,0,1614705400,Charbus
14,gpfnhkw,"Yeah agree with most of the comments on here, I would watch and try to buy in the dip, so far I'm in gains, no one will know what will happen with gme",1,0,1614705462,danyleewarren
15,gpfnq3h,Yeah I'm retarded,1,0,1614705566,freefunds33
16,gpfnv2l,We are holding 10x better than before. Go look at January you retarded glue eating fuck. Jesus I thought I was retarded. Sit back little boy. Let the OG retards and autists teach you something.,0,0,1614705627,Lord_HellFire
17,gpfoen0,"It’s the same shit on a slower timeline, it will drop eventually and the highs aren’t as high but the lows could be lower. An entry point of $130 is TRULY retarded and there’s other stuff that’s better deals during these red ass days if you bother to look. You got selective amnesia, people were seriously talking about $10000 PTs for a whole week the sub went to shit while the stock did too. 

There are still bag holders with $250 averages because this was their first play and they thought they were sticking it to the man or some shit.

But fine I’ll eat my glue and when I see your broke ass in the unemployment line I’m not sharing.",1,0,1614705865,Charbus
18,gpfp4ju,"Guess what shit stain. This is why you are not destined for great things. You’re just a paper handed little boy. I only have one thing to say to someone like you...

21,gpghcq5,"Lmao I mean it’s always a good time to buy in if you’re a retard! I bought as many shares as I have wrinkles in my brain, so &lt;1. Asking for financial advice here is a bad place to start from what I’ve seen, these people here are apes, loving and fun apes, but still just retarded apes.",1,0,1614718286,wesmc33
22,gpghkfz,HAHA! Wasn't necessarily asking for financial advice...just wondering if this was a holding situation versus buying or selling. Thanks! I dove in on RKT!! Big win today! Good luck apes!,2,0,1614718373,THEBEGINNING_00
