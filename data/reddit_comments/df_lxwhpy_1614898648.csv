17,gppl2hh,"I can‚Äôt say anything for certain since GME is unpredictable. But it would in theory. If people start exercising their contracts and holding there‚Äôs fewer and fewer available shares, there‚Äôs only so many shares in the float and when options make up 10% even if 2% exercise it‚Äôs still a massive number of shares

Supply and demand, slowly but sure supply is decreasing and demand is increasing as MM‚Äôs need to hedge",3,0,1614898983,yodisc
18,gppl3gs,""" In a gamma squeeze,  the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying  many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option  sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks ""

The price doesnt go up because an option was purchased, it goes up because market makers have to hedge and buy shares to do so once it becomes apparent they are ITM

It‚Äôs a cause and effect though, there has to be huge amounts of options purchased, which creates a situation where covered calls being sold turn into naked calls being sold, they can‚Äôt leave themselves  exposed like that because MM need to stay neutral. This in turn causes them to buy to hedge and cover their ass. In the case of GME if everyone is diamond handing it, a massive uptick in options buying will at some point trigger MM buying shares with a limited supply causing big spikes in price, creating more contracts to be ITM. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve seen big price swings today and last Thursday, if you‚Äôve noticed, there have been some big call purchases near market close both days, I can only assume this is to try to make more contracts ITM the day before expiration.

Now on the other hand, yeah if people exercise call options then it can create more pressure for the following week because MM will have to purchase more shares, but let‚Äôs be honest here, unless someone has been holding cheap ass options like DFV and those shares will only cost him $12 a piece, most people aren‚Äôt going to exercise their contracts, they are gonna take profit where they can. 

I‚Äôm not in anyway looking for an argument, I would love to see multiple gamma squeezes because I‚Äôm currently holding shares in GME. All that being said, those stimulus checks could work wonders if everyone bought super cheap ass deep OTM calls all on the same day. Imagine even a small percentage of WSBers all buying $1400 worth of call options. Even just 10% of members. That‚Äôs 900k people x $1400. 

$1.26 billion in call options would make MM buy shares multiple times over if it all happened in a single day. There‚Äôs your catalyst to start the squeeze of all things squoze.

Lastly I‚Äôll end with this, and this is just my honest opinion- I think gamma squeeze will slow and stock price could start coming down in the coming weeks when the highest strike price is no longer $800. Those calls are dirt cheap, when the highest strike is in the $400s, premiums are obviously much higher. I obviously could be wrong but I think less people will be buying more expensive options. Let‚Äôs hope before we get to that point the price goes to the moon and gets us back to having deep OTM options to buy",19,0,1614898997,Stonks_GoUp

And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.

However, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge.

94,gppnq9c,"this point seems to be missed in all the posts about gamma squeezes.

It has nothing to do with options being exercised.  It has nothing to do with being in the money or out of the money.  It just has to do with the price of the underlying rising, causing more shares to be needed to maintain a delta neutral position.

So a gamma squeeze does not happen at expiration.  At expiration gamma is 0.  A gamma squeeze happens as the price of the underlying moves up before expiration.  The further before expiration the better, because gamma is higher.  This is true even for options that are out of the money.  For example if the underlying is 100 and someone is short a lot of 200 calls they might own some small number of shares to hedge.  If the underlying goes up to 150 the option is still well out of the money but more shares are needed to maintain a delta neutral position.  So the shares are bought on the way up.

If anything, if a run up really is caused by a gamma squeeze, it should crash quickly after expiration since the buying pressure disappears.  Someone maintaining a delta neutral position will not have to buy anything at expiration; they already have the shares.  They bought them slowly during the run up.",255,2,1614900299,Keith_13
