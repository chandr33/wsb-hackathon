Some people say it's a needed part of the market, and I know not every short is necessarily trying to bankrupt a company, but shorting just seems scummy.

53,gqi4y2w,"Can anyone explain how this is legal?

I had some money in my Public account, and was looking to move it over to my Schwab account so it was all in one place. I had some GME on there from weeks ago that I had bought at ~$250 a share, so I was excited to sell it, and rebuy it so that it was all on one account.

I set up a [sell option on my Public account at 7:51](https://imgur.com/2wcpLPO) this morning for 11 shares at $320 a share. GME was at 295 at that point and growing, so I figured if it hit $320, it would trigger the sale, and once I got the notification, I'd buy on the Scwab to move it over.

At 8:35am, GME passed $320 a share, and stayed above $320 a share for over a half hour, reaching over $344 a share at 9:15am. Then the strange market collapse happened. 20 minutes after that collapse, [I get a notification from Public that they sold my 11 shares, but sold them for $184.25](https://imgur.com/EZtwTMi). 

How is this legal? How can they agree to a pending sale at $320/share, and then sell it for nearly half that value?",11,0,1615416172,Kristic74
