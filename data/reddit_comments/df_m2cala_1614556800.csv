2,gqibvs2,the difference is that AMC might give you 100%+ or maybe 150% if it moons whereas GME can give you 100% on a single day and a whopping 1000%+ return if it moons. Sure AMC is cheaper to get into but if you buy hundreds of dollars worth of AMC you might as well just get some GME. just my opinion,11,0,1615419630,jaxpied

5,gqic91u,That’s what I’m saying. Amc reporting today came out bad too. Amc does move with gme but not as fast as gme. For the past few days gme moved like $40-$50 up everyday. Where amc moved like $1-3 per day.,-5,0,1615419822,App2918q

11,gqiistz,GME drowns out all the AMC news or attention. GME has multiple mega threads in a sub with 9mil users. AMC has a sub with only 80k users. If AMC had the same following and loyalty it would definitely be on par with GME. I see AMC as a young GME. I’m all in,10,0,1615423305,RRickC137
12,gqike8x,Wow so you never heard of sympathy plays in the stock market before? Literally tons of stock move the same. There are even specific firms that their whole way of making money is just to scalp in and out on sympathy plays. It’s not the “hedgies”,2,0,1615424160,canolyb1

17,gqjnzzn,"It’s simple. There are hundreds of algos that are now market making on both of these order books because of their volatility. They are making a killing filling inside the bid and ask and trading to market orders. 

They look identical because algo market making is dominated by a few big players. You know the names. 

Not to mention everyone is trading these stocks. Swing traders. Day traders. Pairs traders.  This sub. Retail traders. It’s the top of news on CNBC everyday. Boomers are playing them. 

All this volume and volatility, these algos literally move these markets in unison because the same players are in both. And these algos aren’t even drawing the shape on purpose, they are just reacting to similar order flow and constantly scalping the wide spreads  

It isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s just that a few firms have essentially “solved” the market and move price based on their market making strategies.",1,0,1615446933,videogamesjdkdjdj

21,gqmsxqr,"You have to pull that back and look at %. I do think GME wins but AMC seems to be more stable so less risk buying and holding.

At some point GME will correct back down and it may be very violent.",1,0,1615506661,neothedreamer
