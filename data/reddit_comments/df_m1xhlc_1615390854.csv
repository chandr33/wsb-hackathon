48,gqgex6m,100k is the floor and it'll likely go higher. Anyone selling @1k when it gets there is likely to be FUD given that it will be the hedges last chance to salvage their position.

It started to dip below 100 and I thought there was no way it would ever go back up if it went below my buy in so I sold. But I did have 1.6 shares that I bought in around $150. I took a loss on those. So yeah that’s what this is. It’s just a wash sale. Thanks!,1,0,1615390874,InSixFour
