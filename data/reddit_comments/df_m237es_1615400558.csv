81,gqh4mt8,"Rule 201 (Alternative Uptick Rule), a short sale-related circuit breaker that when triggered, will impose a restriction on prices at which securities may be sold short. 

This alternative uptick rule is designed to restrict short selling from further driving down the price of a stock that has dropped more than 10% in one day. It will enable long sellers to stand in the front of the line and sell their shares before any short sellers once the circuit breaker is triggered.

Basically, they have to open their short sell price above the last close price for the next two days, I think by a dollar.",1,0,1615400571,GeckoRocket
