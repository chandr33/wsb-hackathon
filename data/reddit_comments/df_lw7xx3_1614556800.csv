30-31 is probably a conservative fair value now.

If they started covering today, does it signify that it most likely will require two more days to cover or do you think that they've already covered due to the massive volume.

60,gphan05,"If I knew that I'd have more than 40 shares worth, lol.  Plus I'm not a financial advisor.  However, I think most of the old shorts got out and new shorts filled their place.  If there is one thing that I learned about trading is that hedge funds are cutthroat, greedy mf'ers.  That's the only lesson.  So there might still be a lot of shorts in there but it gets interesting because of the dividend.  That's the part, to me, that is different than GME.  Hedges could and are keeping the GME price (relatively) low because they don't care about pennies on the dollar for FTD's and their puts.  It's nothing to them.  They can't let it get crazy high - they'll drag it out forever until we finally get a catalyst from Cohen or something else happens.   But with RKT, the dividend they have to pay if they are still shorted on Friday wrecks their game.  So are they gonna continue shorting till Friday?  Probably, unless the price gets too high for them.  But they do not want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars and not get anything in return by keeping it past then.  I mean, that is taking money and just lighting it on fire if they have to pay that dividend on Friday-Tuesday.  So they might just bail and let retail have this one until they jump back to shorting next week when they can crazily short it down from however high it gets on friday-tuesday and then go back to winning.  So yeah, I think it will go up or stay flat till Friday, moon on Friday/Monday, hover high on Tuesday (since that is when everyone gets their dividend), then watch it plummet on Wednesday.
