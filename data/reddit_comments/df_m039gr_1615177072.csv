5,gq7xuwg,"The average cost of each locked share is $8, which creates a strong incentive to lock in profits. Remember dash insiders priced this stock at $102 for the IPO so they‚Äôre already pumped to get that much. 

Say 20% of the locked shares sell, that‚Äôs 22M shares hitting a stock that trades 2-3M per day. I don‚Äôt see people buying that much volume at $150/share in this market.",1,0,1615218202,weastcoastal11

8,gq86vrf,"Am chef, as someone in the industry iv never considered investing in any of these delivery platforms until the entire service is automated.  Self driving car pulls up, I scan all the items to prove they are in vehicle, it drives off to customer.  The service itself rite now is way too expensive and they fuck up way too much and then customers ask for a refund way too often.",1,0,1615222044,Bamstradamus
9,gq87h31,"40c/mi all in would be for a newer, nicer vehicle which hopefully you are not using to deliver. 

If your car costs 40c/mi to drive, sell it for a cheaper car even if you aren't delivering. Use the proceeds for DASH puts. Masturbate with your free time.

10,gq88jiu,"Idk if this is still true but when I first used the doordash app years ago it was pretty shitty. I ordered from the app twice and both times I had to complain about missing food in my order. Receiving a credit both times. (Which didn‚Äôt even cover what I paid)

Simply put when you put something into your cart and click ‚Äúadd item‚Äù whatever you add in that field doesn‚Äôt show up to the Restruant‚Äôs system. If you want multiple items you have to add them to the cart and not the ‚Äúadd item‚Äù section. 

If you accidentally add multiple items to your cart, the delete button removes all items. (If you wanted 4 burgers and clicked 5, pressing delete removes all 5. Which you‚Äôd then have to go back and add)",1,0,1615222732,Cool-Sage
