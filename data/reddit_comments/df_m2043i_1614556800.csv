11,gqgeovm,"Lol, got on the train late? Dude, this sub is NOT for pump and dumb scemes but for gambling with stonks.  It just so happened that GME came along, and we all smelled blood in the waters like hungry sharks because something smelly was going on. We like to show off losses, gains and brag about stupid things we actually like. Another coordinated attack? Highly unlikely. For those things you’ll probably need to find another sub of forum. 
Good luck",2,0,1615390767,ikheetbas
