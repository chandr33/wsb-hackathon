It really does seem like there's some big players squeezing. Every time someone shorts, they never get the chance to buy back in lower as the price is maintained steadily upwards.

If the hedgies just lose a little bit of their greed and go back to playing the way they were meant to near their formation, this wont ever happen again. 

That being said, I actually dont think they will let us moon yet. The number of shares they need to cover is so many that I think it makes sense that they will need to convince retail the moon happened multiple times, so they can get their shares in waves, instead of paying everyone on mars. So you may get another dip. It just depends on if they have enough liquidity to push back against all the greek hedging happening",1,0,1615391842,robbyatmlc
