12,gqixqpm,"It's a platform where developers create games and items for kids, teenagers and sometime adults can play and use.  Developers can make many different types of games like roleplay, FPS, sports, anime, action, fantasy etc.  Almost anything is possible to be made. Developers and creators are paid using the virtual currency which is robux.  Robux can be converted into USD after a certain amount is accumulated.  Of course Roblox takes a chunk of the profits for themselves, but the games have multiple streams of revenue from the amount of people playing your game, the amount of players you retain over a given time, game passes and if your game is paid access.  I'm a developer on the platform and it's continuously improving making development and game experience more interactive and immersive.",3,0,1615431144,CripCripCripp
