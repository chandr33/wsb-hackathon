39,gqdk43w,"AMC has so much going for it right now.

1.) Riding GME's wave  
2.) Short Interest is high  
3.) Earnings report tomorrow (the CEOs been making rounds on media being super positive about how much AMC streaming has grown)  
4.) AMC theaters are re-opening across the country  
5.) Big institutions have been buying in for the past few days

Even if a squeeze isn't triggered, it's going to go up in the next few months with all these going for it. AMC is one of my safest plays right now.
