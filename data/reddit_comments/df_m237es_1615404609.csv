36,gqhelz9,"Alright here is some insight as to how not be a bagholder. There will come a point where the stock price is mooning. Don't be a part of that buy in. Don't fomo in. Why? Because the squeeze comes from *THEM* buying, the *hedgefunds*. Buy what you can afford to lose while it is low. But set a no more buying limit for yourself. Set a sell limit too! (Unless you outright don't care and just wanna hold the stock till death. Which I salute you if you do). Point is whether we rocket into $1 million or somehow GME disappears. Act in your own intrest and families. Don't do anything you will regret.

Look, I am glad someone is trying to make sense of this mess.
My theory is - 

The HF realized if they can temporarily crush the price, it might cost them a few $zeros now, but it certainly stops it from hitting that $800c strike, which then triggers legit catastrophic bankruptcy filings.

Whatever their reason, it flat out looks like market manipulation at its most basic:
""We are over leveraged on our short positions, so we made moves to change the stock price so we are less over leveraged now.""

That is what should be investigated.",5,0,1615404638,se7en41
