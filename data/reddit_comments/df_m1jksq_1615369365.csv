1,gqfn5tt,Thank you!!!! can you continue your analogies ? I would subscribe in a second.  You make things easy to understand.  I have an M.S. and still get confused by the stock market even though I read and study it voraciously.,1,0,1615374572,caralilly7
2,gqfo87j,"Agree on both point about the fact that the market is a casino and that sharp bettors know when to take advantage of low prices, so in theory, downturns shouldn’t hurt anyone who still has time to make future gains. Just saying I’m not sure the government is willing to have a crash just so that we can fuck over HFs for tendies.",1,0,1615375515,Tony_Ice
3,gqfwm0q,"a lot HFT firms act as market makers, a bit different than what most hedge funds do. I think HFT has its issues also, but I do believe they play an important role in markets as well. 

There should be a wide adoption of a 'road-bump' type system like IEX has implemented to inhibit some of the more perceived nefarious activity.

I am of the belief that most HFT firms operate above board and do provide a legitimate service in providing liquidity to market participants",1,0,1615381724,ze_end_ist_neigh

9,gqgepmn,"What you said made sense except for

\- ""They are user owned not for profit"" - They are mostly owned by banks and brokerages, but they are in fact for profit. Otherwise, this line in their 2019 annual report ([https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance)) makes no sense

\&gt; ***DTCC delivered another year of strong financial performance with net income of $218 million before payment of our preferred dividend.***

\- Although I admit saying what there was any link between Citadel and DTCC is nearing a factless conspiracy theory (hence ""tin foil hat""), and I highly doubt that there's any explicit or implicit agreement between Citadel and DTCC, I was pointing out everyone's incentives. DTCC's incentive here is to ensure Citadel does not go under.",1,0,1615390776,ASoftEngStudent
10,gqgeygi,"I think the claims Mike Lewis writes about makes for a great read, but it is grossly overstated in terms of overall % composition of market participants

HFT claims completely evaporate when considering brokers that provide retail/institutional clients with direct market access

No doubt about it lower tier brokers sacrifice best execution practices for their clients in exchange for revs from HFT for order flow",1,0,1615390883,ze_end_ist_neigh

\&gt; as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements",1,0,1615393297,ASoftEngStudent
16,gqgmk4a,"&gt;  [DTCC adheres to international regulatory standards to maintain back-testing coverage at 99%. This means we are required by our regulators to maintain the clearing funds at a level that covers potential liquidation losses 99% of the time, for each of our clearing corporations. Every day, we run calculations and simulate default scenarios to see if we have any gap or exposure between the margin we collected and what could have occurred in a loss.](https://www.dtcc.com/dtcc-connection/articles/2021/january/12/how-margin-calls-help-protect-the-industry)
