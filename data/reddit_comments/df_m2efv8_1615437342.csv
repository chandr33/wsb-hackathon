14,gqj9obt,"Was getting worried that I am not focusing on my work with all that initial momentum. Desperately wanted to get my eyes off the market. The dip was interesting but boring. Didnt have a stop loss so lost my earnings by about 50%. I simply took a nap and returned to my work. Checked after market close to see if it is back to $38. I have been planning to sell a bunch of my collectible stuff to put some money in it if it returns to $30-40. 
 
Anyway, it was pretty desperate. I kinda felt sorry for them. I mean, it's just entertainment for me. I got mine at $95 and I don't care much about any short term gains. I've held index funds for years with 6 to 7 percent gains. So I'll just check occasionally for the adrenaline rush without touching it.

So if you wanna get some good dip numbers this helps  tons with not buying too early and refretting it.
