4,gq9k51g,"Exact same situation here. Found out about it after buying was stopped (didn't even know at the time). FOMO'ed in without thinking about it at $263 a share. Averaged down to almost $63 a share, and now boarding the rocket to Andromeda. 

If they just let it squeeze the first time I wouldn't even be on this rocket, and I'm sure it's the same for a lot of apes. Nevermind the second round of FOMO we're seeing now, like Conan O'Brien for one example.",14,0,1615243449,StinkyMonkey85
5,gq9k7bl,Yeah Iâ€™m also pretty sure. They actually might have done the biggest mistake in history. Would have been so much easier to just let it squeeze take their losses and continue their game making billions over and over again. Now the whole world is watching them and new regulations to stop their infinity money making train.,20,0,1615243481,Fantasybroke
6,gq9kdxo,Yes the change to the DTCC rules are very telling of how far they have dug the hole IMO.,17,0,1615243575,Spacer_Spiff
7,gq9l3pw,Exactly! Itâ€™s just not about the money they would have lost. Think how much less money the new regulations (hopefully) will stop them from making in future from this kind of plays.,3,0,1615243935,Fantasybroke
8,gq9lagv,Stop. No. They will for sure be wiser though. Huge kick in the nuts does that.,3,0,1615244030,Spacer_Spiff
9,gq9mc9l,"I didnt buy a lot at +300 and rode all the way down and bought more at 40. This slow ride from 40 is making me even more confident ive made a good choice. 500 aint shit, 750 aint shit, 1000 aint shit. Im not greedy (okay maybe a little) but im gaining confidence every day this is going pass 1000",9,0,1615244565,YourTypicalFriend

11,gq9mvi6,Same here. We havenâ€™t seen what their next move is if they have any. Maybe a selling halt when we getting closer to moon? ðŸ¤£,3,0,1615244844,Fantasybroke
12,gq9qsj7,"Let's just say the coils are as far back as can be sprung. 

I'd happen to agree with your hypothesis. How can this not have screwed them more. One it got rid of papers hands but the smart people who Brough high averaged down and to add to this. What do they think will happen when everyone hears at the same time GME is about to go MOON. Likes moths to a flame like myself I went in high and so will the same people who paper handed the last time because this time they can't halt us. 

More people will jump on turning the stock way more volatile than it was. Which goes back to my opening line. The coil is about to be released. And with that a stimmy in every yanks hand it's gonna get way worse for the hedges. Melvin will collapse for real this time.",2,0,1615246911,MrStormz

24,gq9xdcj,"It was a bold strategy to see if they could get out clean. 

 Upside: free and clear, better rep for handling an unprecedented event.

Downside: lose it all including rep for losing to a bunch of apes",2,0,1615250425,TutekTheLegend

27,gq9zz49,"You apes donâ€™t get it. The brokerages like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade limited buys because they cannot let the HFs go under. Companies like Robinhood make money a couple of ways: 1) selling your order flow to market makers like Citadel. 2) lending your GME and other shares to short to HFs like Melvin Capital. 

If Melvin Capital went under, Robinhood would be on the hook for all the shares lent short. Thatâ€™s why RH, TD and IBKRs step in to save HFs. 

I am surprised more people are not pointing this out.",1,0,1615251854,percypeerless
