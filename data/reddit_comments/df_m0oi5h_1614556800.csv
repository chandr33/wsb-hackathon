9,gq8z8u0,Dipping is never a good thing. You want the price to keep increasing so they have to hedge more. There's basically the entire float in call its impossible to hedge. You don't want a dip you want consistent daily gains so the interest is higher for shorts. Lower price also makes it easier to short.,27,0,1615234065,Good-Appearance2488

18,gq9164i,"Curious why this reads like a complete 180 from your previous post. The key to this, how I see it, is to continue maintaining higher floors. Panic selling is the only thing to fear imo and I have more faith in you apes than I‚Äôve ever had before. As long as buying pressure is being applied, the rest will sort itself out.

20,gq91yi2,"He scammed me into reading crap we all know minus the financial conspiracies that shit happens all the time and they end up being correct üòÇ. I don‚Äôt believe in anything the news tells me if I did, not a penny would have been made by me. If anything I would trust the conspiracy that short interest is over the top and that they didn‚Äôt cover their large position because nothing tells us they did in full concrete. This stock isn‚Äôt worth much and sole hype alone isn‚Äôt enough to drive it up this far.

It's pretty clear when you look at things like today's \~38,000 contract volume for $800C weekly options (that's \~$7.7M somebody spent in bets it hits $800 by Friday) and the massive intraday swings that there are some big players in the game duking it out who hugely outweigh retail.

But at the moment seems like retail took back the reign as everyone is fomoing in. Momentum and FOMO could bring this still a lot higher with the support of smaller gamma squeezes but there probably won't be that big squeeze like we've seen on the 02/23. As soons as momentum will be lost like 01/28, there gonna be üíéüôåleft holding the bag. And if this will happen before next week, than all the gamma squeeze potential of the next week will be lost. At the moment it seems like a big pum, with only those profiting who are selling fast enough, which doesn't mean it can still go to the thousands.",1,0,1615372215,_Dicio
