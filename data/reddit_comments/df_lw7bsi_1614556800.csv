21,gpgo9dj,"""Bears are becoming bulls"" - Thats exactly what happens when the bubble is about to pop. Tesla might eventually take over the market, but the current price is just way too high. The more cars they build their profits are dropping(forget EV credits, wont matter in the long run). The more the competition from other EV companies, they need to reduce the cost of their car, which eventually reduces profits. Unless full FSD comes before anyone else and has a significant advantage, I wouldnt put a dollar in Tesla. Tesla might solve 95% of FSD problems but the last 5% is what matters the most, and is incredibly hard. Why do you think Waymo is taking this long?

 It does not compete. Less range, more money, not as fast, no charging network, no FSD. They admit all this shit in the video. They say *It's not a Tesla but* *It's as fast as you could ever want to drive.* while the TSLA is twice as fast. 

These companies are dead. For the next 3 years they're going to be producing cars that cost more and perform less, continually being years behind TSLA. Do this over and over again and you're bankrupt.

Their area of expertise is no longer relevant. TSLA has been preparing for the last 10 years to get here. They are miles ahead.

Building factories, purpose built to be as efficient as possible to produce these highly desirable and affordable vehicles. Competition is scrambling bad. GM trying to partner with NKLA is the best example.

Battery supply is the major limiting factor. TSLA is actually addressing the supply constraint and reducing costs while they do it.

&gt;Cybertruck &amp; Tesla Semi

Cybertruck is a meme. Do you think it's cool to drive a Hummer H2? They were a meme for a while too.

&gt;Huge Data Head Start

I think there are less than a million teslas with autopilot on the road right now. Maybe a couple million, you tell me. Either way, Toyota makes 10 million cars a year.

1 million cars multiplied by let's say five years = 5 million car-years worth of data.

Tesla simply doesn't make enough cars (yet) for that data advantage to really mean anything. Furthermore, all the data in the world doesn't matter unless you can actually execute on FSD, which TSLA hasn't done yet.

&gt;FSD Subscription coming Q2

it was promised for 2020 and delayed. now it's double-promised for Q2 2021. There are both tech issues and regulatory hurdles. Elon can't force his way through regulatory hurdles. That's not how it works. This could easily be delayed again.
