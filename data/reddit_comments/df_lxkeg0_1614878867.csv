6,gpoc7vl,"Account for what? MMs know what their net exposure is, so they account for it on their own positions. They don't hedge on a per contract basis. A MM's total exposure is also not a single expiration. They look at their exposure across all strikes, expirations, and both put and call. That's yet another other issue with these simple sheets people are posting. Despite all of the other problems I mentioned, they also ignore the fact that other expirations exist and MMs consider their exposure across them.",8,0,1614879713,aint_no_lie

58,gpou05q,"At this point, the stock does not reflect the value of the company. What people are hoping is that when these shorts come time to cover, the hedges will need to buy more shorts to cover their positions than the number available for sale. At that point, the only people left to buy from will be the diamond hands, but they're still gonna be forced (by law) to buy enough shares to cover the positions, so the diamond hands will be able to set their own price to sell. The buy orders will just keep going higher and higher until it hits someone's limit sale, or until someone decides to do a market sell at market rate. If the diamond hands want to sell for $69,420.69 per share, and the hedges need to buy shares, they're gonna have to pay $69,420.69 to get those shares.

It would leave gamestop as basically a 6 trillion dollar market cap company and hedgies couldn't physically pay out all that money if they want to.

IMO DFV doesn't believe in any great short squeeze anymore. He believes they company has really good prospects and could over the long term reach a much higher price.

There are those who still believe this crazy squeeze could happen and boost to $500-$1k.

More people need to realize this. The company is legit worth $20-50 per share, and with proper strategy and earnings to show for it, could be properly valued $40-200 per share, and evolve into a eSports/eGaming giant in the $100-400 range long term (5-10yr outlook).

For now, however, we just caught some assholes with their pants around their ankles and GME to $200, $400, $800, $1,600 are the prices they're gonna have to pay to get themselves out of this.

How do they pay if they don't have the money to buy? They get liquidated. You have $50bil in other shit? Well, we're gonna have to take that and sell it to support buying GME back you silly fucks.",14,0,1614891471,FrankieSaints
