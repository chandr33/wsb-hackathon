10,gqgm99s,Anything is possible though I do not think it would be worth it to them. Also all of these hedge fund guys are buddies. They all went to the same schools and had the same mentors. They all see the stock market as their playground and while they might have some individual rivalries they definitely see this as an “us vs them” situation with them being aligned against us uppity retail investors who have no place in their world.,1,0,1615393781,Pylyp23

Some big hedge funds and brokers and clearing houses pulled some really, really shady shit, which spooked a lot of people, but the fundamentals honestly didn't change that much.
