2,gpnj8yg,"Current gen ryzen chips are touted to be better than current gen intel. GPU game is gaining on nvidia. Ai software starting to utilize amd gpu. I think they are ready to take more market share. 

Haven’t bought the dip but I’m waiting for slight buying pressure. Then, I’m gonna go in dry as fuck because I need them to feel pain when I insert myself.

TLDR: I’m bull dick bullish on AMD",17,1,1614866733,calamitymic

5,gpnjx24,"Their chips sell out INSTANTLY when they hit the market, months after release.  That's all I needed to know.  Already bought in some long options, will probably buy in more.  


On a side note I've build new PC's for years, this year is the first time I've favored AMD over Intel for CPU and I am in love.  It's a better product at a lower price.",10,0,1614867092,VirtualParzival

11,gpnpz0r,"I agree. From conventional wisdom AMD is doing great as a company.

Unfortunately, conventional wisdom does not always apply in this domain. I still haven't seen my buy pattern appear on the chart, so I am assuming the bottom is still not here.
So for that reason, I'm out (temporarily).

Not financial advice, I know literally nothing about stonks.",3,0,1614870035,Otaynotathrowaway
12,gpnspsg,"Im bagholding some AMD.  Ready to get out.  The chip shortage story drove me to buy some.  But the consensus seems to be that these chips are just going to magically start producing out of thin air.  It's going to take years for them to up their production.  TSM is building a new plant, but I still got out of TSM.  So did Auntie Cathie.",1,0,1614871259,MortalDanger00
13,gpnv7ia,"I’ve been researching semi-conductors in depth the past few days. 

I’m eyeing the big retail guys like INTC, NVDA, AMD (agreed with you that AMD is the most promising).

The other segment is the fabricators, they don’t sell chips they just produce them for other companies. I’m keeping tabs on AMAT, TSM, LRCX, NXPI, FORM, UMC).

Then finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).

Look into Biden’s recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. 

This all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.

I don’t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven’t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term. Do you have any thoughts on the reason for this recent downward trend? 

I’m considering making a pretty massive 5-10 year long play on semiconductors.",5,0,1614872359,gb2075
14,gpnvc5p,"Totally agree conventional wisdom isn’t always the main factor in a stock price.

Any theories on the rapid decline recently?",1,0,1614872416,gb2075

18,gq3zfck,"Look into the mining companies ... regardless of which chip manufacturer comes out on top, they are going to need to get their materials somewhere. MP, AMAT, VALE. Vale was poised to be a great bet, then they got hit with a $7B fine for killing nearly 300 people in a dam explosion. According to my buddy from Brazil, apparently people don’t really care / things like that are common.

I’m pretty deep in VALE contracts sadly. But I envision the entire industry will turn around as the market picks back up, and are excellent bets next 5-10 years",1,0,1615135358,gb2075
