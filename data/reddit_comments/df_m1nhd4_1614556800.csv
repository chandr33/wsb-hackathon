7,gqelxar,"Bullish since they still need to buy the shares.  If it's a 2-3 hour window, they have to buy.  If it's a full trading day, they have to buy.  Multiple times over.  If a lot of investors set a 500k floor (not financial advice, I just keep up to date with the DD on the sub named for this ticker), they will reach that floor as they have to buy each and every share, multiple times over.  Check out the DD on the sub I mentioned.",2,0,1615344986,I_Love_Polar_Bears
