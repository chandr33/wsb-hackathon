15,gqfny1e,Yeah that is true - we do get dividend but its like 4% and growth is minimal on the stock. I would rather even put in an S&amp;P ETF. Totally hear you on the private company - I started at one and it was a bitch to deal with RSUs (but at least we were growing).,1,0,1615375267,McK-Juicy

He was advised to sell, but bought more low when people were freaking out and selling because they thought Napoleon was winning at Waterloo. The hero had fought under Wellington and was certain he'd win. He was right. That would be the same as $1,290,000 today. Diamond hands prevail throughout history.",1,0,1615375695,luczai
