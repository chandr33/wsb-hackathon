My roof caved in, someone hit and ran my parked car, totaled it, and my insurance won't cover it.  My coworker got covid and my other coworkers can't smell anything and my doctor is giving me the run around on whether I need a  test.  And because I don't have a car, I can't get an appointment to get my cat spayed and she keeps trying to fuck me and it's getting awkward.

But this community makes me laugh.  Sure making money makes me feel good, but coming on here and watching the charts and reading your comments make me feel better.

79,gqg6izh,"If I have my info correct (and that's a mind blowingingly large IF) it doesn't matter if they short further to cover their losses. Because the original shorts still exist. It's perpetual until they can close those original shorts and take the largest L in history. But if they close those shorts, that's the catalyst to send this to the next galaxy. But think of the original shorts as an fatal wound, and new shorts as a band aid on said wound. It's just staving off the inevitable. Hence why we need to hold. The longer and more shares we hold, increases volatility (for good or bad) so the pressure builds until even the smallest numerical movement can rocket or crash.",1,0,1615387101,QikStrikeGaming
