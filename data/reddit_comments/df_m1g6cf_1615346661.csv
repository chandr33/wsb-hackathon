65,gqep1pc,"Im about to do the worst thing I can think of and offer some sincere advice... and I‚Äôm going to start with this- do not take advice. Whether you think its good or bad, by your estimation. *Listen* to advice, which is different, if you have a mind to. Then do your own homework and make your own decisions, and own them. Taking advice is a scapegoat for weak thinkers and thats not what you are. Never again will you take advice and then blame the advisor when things go afoul! Be an individual you beautiful person you!

Second, be aware of survivorship bias. Cemeteries are full of risk-takers that never breathe a word about their loss. If you think the people who made real money on GME took risks you are in the wrong forum. Thats not how any of this works.

My final piece of advice is to walk away and get your mind right, friend. If you are here taking risks to make money then truly you are wasting not only your money but your time and your life as well. And I love you too much to watch you do it. Take a minute and reduce your positions until you are no longer taking risks. If you want to play this game you need to consider the money already lost the minute you hand it over to your broker. Its not a risk- its a cost to enter the themepark. Once you are in with that mentality have fun man. Take responsibility for your actions and I‚Äôll be watching for your gain porn in the months to come.

Thats my advice, I hope you don't take it. But I‚Äôm glad you listened.",3,0,1615346756,Tristanexmachina
