5,gqhnew6,"This is really great, and even the technicality of using 1000 factorial means it‚Äôs not FUD. I really don‚Äôt want to be that guy, but it feels like the impact of this post is that the price target of $1000 (knowing most people will not interpret ! as the factorial symbol) is being pushed here.

Thank you. But also, $1,000 is peanuts.

$500,000 per share is the floor.

Nothing has improved since then... although, this year is proving surprisingly busy for most people. Now mind you, ""busy"" is about 30% of our heyday. People need to feel ""wealthy"" before they drop $20K+ rebuilding grandma's piano. The dotcom era was really the best time, lots of stupid money out there. The RE bubble was good, but there is more friction to spend that stupid money. Then the boomers started to retire and dumped all of their unwanted pianos on the market.
