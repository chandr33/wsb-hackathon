2,gqa8gtt,"Well. I can help a bit. RBLX will not be a traditional IPO. But traditional IPO price the night before but do not usually start trading right at the bell.  The MM will gather orders on both sides and it will start at some point. You need to watch it from the bell but there is no “set time”. Abc broiled recommend you go back and look at Spotify first day for trading as it was also a DPO ( which is what RBLX) will be.

Also. No. Not less trustworthy.  The prices a convertible bond equity portion at $45 recently.  I believe the biggest difference is that insider selling can happen earlier.  There is no lock up in the traditional sense.  Several name companies hove come public this as of late",2,0,1615256511,Yeomen23
3,gqa9eg1,"Ok I did read up after my post and found some of what expected. 

Makes complete sense to look at previous first day of trading a DPO like Spotify that you and the article both point out. Maybe we searching that will give me an idea of when it will be available for purchase. 

Any advice on the platform I'm using? I do pretty advance digital currency trades. I just used Robinhood as it was suggested for people who are new to traditional trading.

Thank you!",1,0,1615257019,IWillShowU
4,gqcjzwc,"Ok, I've read up on some stocks that did a DPO instead of a traditional IPO. 

It sounds like nail biting leading to open of the stock.

Where is the best place to monitor the reference price flux up to the open?

I really have faith in this stock for long but want to get maximum gains. Duh, right. So should I jump on the initial reference price open or wait till end of day? I've noticed that the other DPO stocks always drop around 9% by end of day.

Also should I be using a different platform?",1,0,1615309461,IWillShowU
