These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.

Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.

Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying ""oh shit stop the trades"". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.

Also, halts happen quicker on the way up, and slower on the way down. If a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted. But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.

There's just fewer halts on the way down than the way up.

GME's been halted seven times today the last time I revised this. *If I am wrong about any of this, please let me know.*

GME was halted after it dropped from like $337 to $302 for five minutes, then halted for five minutes again when it started trading again and dropped from $277.21 to $248.68, then it repeated when it dropped to $216, and then $198. Let me know if any of this is wrong, I don't want to be spreading misinformation.

You can also look up ""LULD"" which means ""limit up limit down"" for more info.",36,1,1615402986,RutabegaSuede

For example, I own a 800c 3/19 for GME and I sold a call (800c 3/12) for about $345.00 in premium. theta will bleed it to zero since its not hitting $800 in 2 days and so I'm keeping the entire premium and bought a share and RBLX with it.",1,0,1615402992,JawnxWick
