42,gqcxbbz,"Its pretty much irrelevant. 

Hedge funds “need to cover” for 2 reasons:
1) their borrow gets recalled or becomes just too expensive. This is actually super super super rare. Look at RkT. High SI, 50% borrow cost, special dividend, HFs don’t GAF. That spike was hype/ gamma probably very few covered. 

2) they lose too much money and they get equivalent of margin called. Typically this involves losing money on both sides of the book like what happened in January. 

Managing short positions is very difficult for one big reason- as your trade goes against you it gets bigger. 

Ex: 
Go long XYZ 5% of your portfolio. You’re wrong, it doesn’t work out, Stock down 40% the trade shrinks itself to 3% 

Go short ABC -5% of your portfolios. You’re wrong, stock goes up 40%, uh oh it’s now a -7% position.  They literally have to keep buying just to keep the position the same size. 

Anyway, if your shorts make a huge move  against you and your longs also are down it’s a disaster. Your capital has declined while your shorts are ballooning. Literally have to keep buying and buying and buying.
GME would not have played out the way it did in January if a bunch of other short names weren’t also up and a bunch of popular HF longs weren’t also down. 

**ANYWAY** if the HF is short through an ETF neither of these apply. The borrow isn’t getting recalled nor is it super expensive. And the ETF price movement isn’t extreme enough to force covering.
You ask “what if they shorted the ETF and bought all the other stocks to stay short GME”? 1) this is convoluted and expensive I doubt anyone did this. 2) that doesn’t help you. It IS synthetic meaning their borrow won’t be recalled. They won’t really be “forced” to cover",1,0,1615315469,Verb0182

48,gqcxlfq,"Eh I think this is a bit too GME centric. My theory is that rising yields have made the qqqs and spoos less attractive as the div yield on spy is now less than the 30yr yield. As big, safe institutions took money off the table that caused a deleveraging event which cascaded. Deleveraging works both ways: shorts can get margin called too. So I think that the broad market selloff just helped throw some catalyst fuel on the smoldering GME situation as some of the shorts were forced to cover",4,0,1615315610,stevieraykatz
