58,gqhx4o4,"The more I think about it the more it doesn't make sense that it was profit taking. No hedge fund sells a massive position all at once. It limits their profits bc it tanks the stock as they sell. They would sell slowly and consistently. It could only have been shorts borrowing more shares and selling instantly. 
If you think about it, the last 2 weeks have been a very stable uptrend, no halts, no major dips. I dont know for a fact but I've heard that you have 3 days to sell the shares you borrow otherwise you have to give them back. So since this week has been especially stable with no major downswings, I assume they have been borrowing the last 3 days and dumped them all at once today.",14,0,1615412571,nekola90

Welcome. Now stop. 

Go read and do some DD (due diligence) and learn about why this is just getting started. 

For now, hold. But direct your technical questions to the search bar and change your mindset. 

Don't ask where the moon is. Ask if you're prepared to accept the fact that you will soon be driving a 2021 Tesla Model X. 

Mentally prepare for what life is going to feel like when you don't have to be a slave to your shitty job/boss anymore.
