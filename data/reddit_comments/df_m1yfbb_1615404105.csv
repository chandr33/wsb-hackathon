You see lvl 2 in TorS GSCO has a shorting Algo on. Which means they have two accounts buying and selling so to control the stock price.

30,gqiuh63,"Short summary: 

Bull thesis = mortage origination will continue to be profitable, and projections are underestimating demand for new homes and real estate. UWMC price is suppressed by short sellers because of fears over rising interest rates and mortage origination. Russel index inclusion is a big boon.

Bear thesis = Too much enthusiasm over russel 1000 and 2000 index inclusion. Mortage origination margins will decline due to competition and rising interest rates. The housing market and refinancing rates will pull back after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. 

The stock jumped ~12% when the Russel 1000 and Russel 2000 index inclusion was announced, trading from about 7.70 to 8.70. 

The real reason why UWMC's stock price is dropping is over interest rate fears, specifically speculation on lower mortage refinancing rates, higher treasury bond yields, and lower margins on mortage origination. 

Just look at the 10 year treasury bond yield. UWMC's price started declining in Jan 2021, right when the 10 year treasury yield starting rising. They've moved inversely to one another. 

Despite this, I'm still bullish on UWMC and planning my own DD post (if I even have enough karma). I think there's an over-correction, and I believe the housing market, along with refinancing, will continue to boom. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I'm long UWMC with call options and shares. I just like the stonk",7,0,1615429409,Drink_Whiskey

32,gqj3djd,I think you all should be thrilled once this stock gets properly valued at $10. I've been seduced many times by the highly profitable company with a weak long term prospect resulting in an absolute dogshit stock. What are the odds UWMC has meaningfully increased their business 2-3 years from now? 10%? Maybe you'll catch a short term wave in the rising tide but much better places to park your money IMO.,1,0,1615434264,I_m_a_turd
33,gqjaivd,"I'm with you.  Refinances may wane with interest rates but housing demand is going nowhere and nobody is going to be waiting for better interest rates to originate a mortgage on the purchase of a home, because real estate prices are going up now and they can always refinance later.

Solid financials, decent dividend, good growth potential, and seemingly undervalued.  I don't think it'll moon, but 30% increase in the share price in the near term is not too far fetched.  Good time to buy.",2,0,1615438861,a_bit_condescending
