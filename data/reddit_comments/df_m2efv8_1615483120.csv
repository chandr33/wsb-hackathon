1,gqlfdwm,No I’m a newbie also. Made props to the og apes in here that held. I just saw it dropping like a rock and it didn’t help the ticker was also freezing at this time so the panic definitely set in for me. I was lucky I guess where I was able to sell at at $244 and basically my profit went right back into a couple shares at $250 so yeah I lost 8$ and sold a couple small shares but it’s all good for the long haul,1,0,1615484230,Legendary__Beaver
