The R2isnt quite on the top of the candlesticks that its supposedly touching and R1 looks hella random to me, like why there specifically??? there aint nothing touching the r1 so why would that be a support/resistance line

also wouldnt it make sense to draw a resistance/support at 13.65?",1,0,1615303061,TheRivenLegend

39,gqc6abk,"Apologies, I forgot to include the pivot point line (which should be below r1) in that image. PP provide a trend bias; prices above the PP imply a bullish bias; while prices below PP denote a bearish bias. The support and resistance lines provide definitive areas where traders will watch out for price action objectively. I think using the terms ""Support and Resistance"" are misleading in this context since people would generally assume resistance means a price is trying to break and support means the price is withholding. However, in this context, the resistance line may also act as the support line depending on the direction of the trend. For the image in my dd, the r2 acts like a resistance line during the down trend, and so does r1 if you look to the right side of the candles.  Hope it helps, I've tried to simplfy the explanation",1,0,1615304334,CoastalHotDog835
