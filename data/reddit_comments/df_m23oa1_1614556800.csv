3,gqgzws6,"very well could be there Mr.

what i do know though, is in order to drop it with 1.56M shares, you would need a train of Ask prices that low. the stock price depicts the last trade fucko. so explain that.",-1,0,1615398823,RexxHolez

7,gqh0jdv,"very good. the order book also depicts the price. As in - the price is the last traded stock that was Bid/asked... So you are telling me, that in only 1.56M shares, you can drop a price by that much because people are ""asking"" for less then the bid?? come on.

please explain then",1,0,1615399022,RexxHolez
