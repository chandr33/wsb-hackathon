0,gqia9xo,"Im with you, but also...let them sell. It only shows who is down for the cause. Let the Paper handed ones go. No matter what we are winning. We can see it by how desperate the HFs are getting by implementing these mind games. Those who buy the dip will recoup the lost shares. I hear you tho we all need to stand string but let the weak leave",11,0,1615418803,Gumes_daredman

3,gqiahc4,"Bro, let the paper handed sell.  They have the right to take their gains and losses and leave.  

Also considering that someone lobbed 4m shares into the market in 20 minutes, I really doubt that the intentionally paper handed outnumber the poor bastards with badly placed stop losses.

Edit to add: plus for anyone with liquid cash, today was just an epic dip for more tendies.",26,0,1615418907,sirstephenthebrave

7,gqicpqn,"I got stopped out, and because Im only retarded, and not fucking stupid, I bought back in with acquiring \~50% more shares than were sold.

Those idiots just gave me more gasoline to pour on them while they are on fire.

But thanks for your advice.",3,0,1615420066,sascourge
8,gqidpvi,I got knocked out with a 300 stop loss. Sucks but it is what it is. I tried to get back in but my $200 order didn't fill and then I was salty and didn't want to pay 240-60. I only had 10 shares at 128 cost basis so it wasn't a big move or whatever.,0,0,1615420597,mb303030
9,gqidu3t,I don't think anyone sold during that 31 minutes.  There were 6 trade halts in 31 minutes.  That means 1 minute of actual trading took place and it was entirely blackrock.,3,0,1615420658,DogeNeverEndin
