In my worthless opinion... yes. Generally by the time you hear that a stock is surging it is too late to get in. Let's be realistic, the price is going up not because of Gamestop's fundamentals (which aren't great, despite today's announcement) but simply due to publicity and people speculating on a short squeeze. And I'm sorry but if an infinity squeeze didn't happen in January when the stock was 140% shorted it's not likely to happen now when it's only 30% shorted. That's not how it works. And even if you believe the stuff about hedgies manipulating the market the first time... why would they not be able to just do the same again?

But this is WSB and retarded strategies do pay off from time to time, so it really is your call. I will throw in that the stock market generally tends to do the opposite of what I do, and I have no position on GME right now, so take that as you will.",-1,0,1615259000,xe3to
