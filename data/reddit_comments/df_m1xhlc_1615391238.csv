13,gqgfseg,fuck my dumb ass. Paperhanded 3 of my 4 shares to buy slgg at 7 a few days back thinking it would shoot up with imminent merger news and that I could use that to buy more GME. I wasn't able to sell w/o a good faith violation when it hit 9 due to putting all my money into it. SLGG dropped and I was unwilling to sell the bag to buy back my GME &amp; then it exploded. At least I'll ride this one share to the moon but god I fucking hate myself for falling for the SLGG hype and not just holding GME till hell froze over.,5,0,1615391242,lupeandstripes
