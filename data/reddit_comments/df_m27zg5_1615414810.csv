60,gqi285u,"Sadly I was busy with real estate today so I was not paying a lot of attention for that run up to 348 and the half off sale that followed.  I was planning on selling some cc's at 350 expecting it to go back to 300 or so but did not expect this and missed the up and the down.

Only thing I was able to do with GME today is the IV spike let me sell 3 $500 ccs Friday exp for quite a bit of money just to raise some cash on the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my read on the event today:

1) scalpers have been waiting for their chance but all this week we have been going up in a nice and orderly way.  Today we finally got ahead of ourselves a little and got to oversold territory.

2) Today is why I will NEVER put in stop loss orders on GME.  The shorts are going to use these dips to activate those.  So don't ask me to do that I will not.

3) It bounced off the moving average which was kind of what it did when we had these in January.

4) we went up above 240 because it is clear to me that 240 is now massive support.  

&amp;#x200B;

I expect us to bounce around in the 240-300 range tomorrow.  Would not be shocked if we finished down a smidge tomorrow at about 250 after spending the whole day consolidating in this 240-300 channel (warning I am a moderate so I tend to take a moderate view).  Friday I expect to break above 300 and finish closer to 350 which we will spend a few days next week consolidating around before busting 350 to get to the 350-500 range.
