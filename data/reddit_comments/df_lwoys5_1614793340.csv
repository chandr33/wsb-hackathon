Agreed, but that's not specific to reddit.  Every community, grown to a certain size, becomes shit.  Whether it's by inclusivity and not offending anyone becoming more important than the original point of the community, or by newcomers co-opting the community for their own gain, or by bad actors maliciously disguising themselves among the new crowd, they're all shit.

This is why I said gatekeeping is necessary.  There is no return path.  You can not return to the good times.  Once a community is big enough, it's irreversibly fucked.

&gt; You need to trim out everything that isn't kosher rules-wise automatically if you can, and then mop up the rest and rescue the non-spam.

No, you need to jump ship.  Make your own new community with more hazing and gatekeeping.  Spending time trying to bail shit out of a sewer is retarded.  Spending _money_ doubly so.",-3,0,1614794999,Asdayasman
