17,gqje8ly,"Here's more reason to be bullish, their 4th quarter results beat market expectations:

 

AMC (ticker: AMC), the largest movie theater chain in the world, posted revenue of $162.5 million in the fourth quarter, surpassing the average expectation of $142.3 million, according to the analysts tracked by FactSet.

The per-share loss for the quarter was $3.15 after charges. Analysts expected an adjusted loss of $3.24 a share.

Shares of AMC jumped 8% in after-hours trading after whipsawing around during the trading session, ending down 6%. They are up 134% over one year compared with the 35% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in the period.

For the full year 2020, AMC reported revenue of $1.24 billion and a per-share loss of $16.15. Analysts expected a loss of $31.18 a share on sales of $1.2 billion, according to FactSet.

Adam Aron, AMC's CEO, said he was optimistic about the continued recovery of the business, noting that moviegoers in critical Southern California markets like Los Angeles would soon be able to return to the theater.

AMC has raised more than $1 billion in cash since the fall to build a buffer against business interruptions. ""This past year has presented AMC with the most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company,"" Aron said in a statement.

With vaccinations spreading in the U.S., more theaters reopening (including New York City last weekend), and a calendar of blockbuster movie releases up ahead, ""we have reason to be optimistic about AMC's ability to get to the other side of this pandemic,"" Aron said.

For the full year 2019, AMC reported a loss of $1.08 a share on sales of $5.55 billion.",14,0,1615440998,Dewars_Rocks

 Quadrupling if a squeeze is triggered is realistic. Thatâ€™s a bet though and it might not pay off, depends how the game goes.

As for actual company value, I think thereâ€™s a good chance it will surge to 16-20 per share in real company value. Those are bullshit numbers but 15+ seems plausible with a rush back to the cinemas, and a pretty stable ride too (no panic sell crash) but will normalize above where it still is today but lower than a peak caused from over a year of withdrawal.

87,gqnpszn,"Ok, don't string me up for this but....

AMC is truly undervalued right now. It's a goddamn pandemic. It's recovered from the short squeeze that threatened to kill them but their entire business model is in limbo. Once everything reopens and they can fill every seat, AMC is going to have the best boom cinemas have seen since Return of the Jedi.

The fact that there MIGHT be a short squeeze is just cherries on an already tasty pie.

Gamestop... well, it WAS grossly undervalued. DFV was 100% right on that. They also have suffered with restricted retail access but not to the extent that AMC has. They're more fighting the online market, which they've now lined themselves up to combat... so they COULD become a real big player, but that's a bit more of a long shot, and a very long game, and the end value is extremely hard to gauge, but betting against value in 5 years at 3x+ current real mkt value is a pretty big bet. The real bet on gamestop at this point is on the squeeze, which can only happen if diamond fucking hands hold diamond strong.... AND that the game is actually playing out as people are hoping TBQH.... because we can't see anyone elses hands, and there's millions of players with a number of huge players that have better information access than we do (but they also grossly underestimate retard stronk)
