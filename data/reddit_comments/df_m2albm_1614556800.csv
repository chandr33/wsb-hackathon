3,gqi2vgd,I was referring to the coordinated brokerage buying halts in January. Trading halts and circuit breakers are a normal part of the system.,5,0,1615415181,SixOneFive615
4,gqi2zl9,Yeah I don’t understand why people don’t see this. They halt AFTER the stock is in free fall. They don’t halt and cause a selloff,5,0,1615415234,Verb0182

8,gqi3vww,Am so proud of my fellow apes today. I was watching the ticker this morning going Holy fuck! Holy fuck its happening today's the day we truly start busting their asses!! We had stopped the short bus and even had room for the 300$ club to get on. Then I take a shower and jerked it to DFV get out and look again to see if I could rub another out and I see 199$ and instead of panicking I start digging thru couch cushions and the piggy bank and just start throwing my lunch money at that shit as quick as I could... nice try hedgies we ain't falling for it again I tell myself and now we end green  again for the day. Nice try fuckers but stupid 🦍 see the dip and apes throw more shit in your face!!! 💎🙌💎🙌🚀🚀🚀,12,0,1615415664,killmeplease1979

11,gqi4fgl,"I have mildly fucked around with GME with 5-10 shares, getting in and out with my paper hands flapping in the wind, just for shits. But then I saw today’s fuckery and realized how badly we have wounded these people. So I got in for 50 shares @ 255. Looking forward to watching these things fly like they are the new $B to the TC. Or maybe they crash and I stuff my face with some red crayons, but get to tell my grandkids about the time we banded together on the internet, buying the most retarded of stonks just because we liked it, and caused some hedge funds to lose billions while showing their weakness to the entire world. They could manipulate anything, up until they let a bunch of stubborn, retarded apes buy up all the Gamestock stock.",18,0,1615415924,shortgamegolfer

I'm on the similar boat as you. Bought and sold some GME for profit, but when yesterday's insane shit happened, I bought 15@$240 with my GME profits. Even if all is lost, it's okay to me since I'm not losing more than my initial investment.",4,0,1615419022,JustANyanCat
