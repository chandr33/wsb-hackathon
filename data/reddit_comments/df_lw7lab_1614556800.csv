0,gpfq2a4,"I’m not a paid shill, at many points in time GME doing well was great for me and my business.  To be honest, though, it’s a piece of shit company (and this from someone who’s seen under their dress).  It was a piece of shit company 4 years or so ago when I worked with them heavily and that was well before their entire business model was made obsolete.

I get it: WSB ran a short squeeze on GME, it was actually a success for the first time in WSB history, and now everyone who doesn’t understand the markets is pissed that they got left holding the bag while the 10 actual traders on here prospered.  It’s a piece of shit, though.  It will only further become more of a piece of shit.  It’s retail in a sector where retail is quite literally a legal monopoly.  It’s like starting a brick and mortar store that sells iPhones and iPhone apps: makes no sense since Apple sells the phone and controls app downloads online.",1,0,1614706589,ziplocfullacock
1,gpfqfnd,Thanks retard.  You had the experience of working with GME while it was a dying animal stuck in a bear trap.  It is now a Phoenix reborn.,1,0,1614706750,digitalgoodtime
2,gpfrbut,"Provide any information or data to support that...aaaand you can’t.  Apart from WSBs love for the company, there is nothing there adding value and all of their assets (website included) are hemorrhaging value.

They had a decent bit of cash on hand for a while, but that is now plummeting too and with no real innovation to speak of (and soon no funds to foster innovation) they are likely going to go the way of Sears.

I actually want to like the company.  I even went into their store the other day to get some of the nostalgia of my childhood back and give them business.  Everything I asked for, though, the hobbit working their recommend other companies’ websites to me.  That is no bueno for business.",1,0,1614707142,ziplocfullacock
3,gpfs9hd,"Plenty of DD on this subreddit you can peruse to confirm my bias.  CFO gone, Cohen and Chewy crew in.  Most likely going to e-commerce to compete with other online retailers....etc.  I see GME at $700-$1000/share in the next 5 years.  The buzz around GME alone is incredible for momentum of the company.",2,0,1614707548,digitalgoodtime
4,gpftjxj,"You’re a retard...like an actual retard.

Their website is a huge piece of shit and a problem all on its own, but they’re in an industry where they quite literally can’t do that.  With video games, you can’t really compete on prices, the market doesn’t work like that.  Everything is turning digital anyways and being routed through official stores so they will be an outlier and unable to do any of their buy/sell/swap business.

Also, what exactly are they going to do with their brick and mortar stores?  They have a gazillion of them and with each a long-term lease liability that would cost a fortune to buy out of.

They are a turd.  They will continue to be a turd.  They had their moment in the sun do to market conditions, nothing to do with the company itself.  If you think they’ll actually be a $50b market cap, you are legitimately retarded and should step away from the Bloomberg.",1,0,1614708102,ziplocfullacock
5,gpg0kre,"I am a retard, thank you!  

Who said anything about just selling video games?  If Ryan Cohen can do with Gamestop what he did with Chewy, you're going to see a brand new product/service from Gamestop.  They'll close a majority of their stores and replace them with state of the art flagship centers.  Gaming centers...etc.  

If you took your helmet off for long enough, you might get a wrinkle or 2 in your brain to realize that people don't just dump money into a sinking ship.  They have other plans.

I'll come back to you once the shares are over $500 and stay there.",1,0,1614711124,digitalgoodtime
6,gpg1z2v,"Haha!  Do that...their shares will never be worth $500 each.

...and yes, people do dump money into sinking ships, that’s the entire private equity business model.  They dump money into distressed companies, which GameStop is, hoping it will turn around.  PEs hope for a success rate of around 1:9/1:10 (this coming from an Executive Managing Director of The Carlyle Group) and I’d be willing to bet heavily that GameStop isn’t that 1.

Go ahead, though, I can’t wait for you to gloat when the shares are $500 (funny how just a comment ago you were saying $700-$1000, is it going to be $300 in the next comment?).",1,0,1614711713,ziplocfullacock
7,gpg2i6d,$700-$1000+ for the squeeze.   Will settle over $500.,1,0,1614711939,digitalgoodtime
