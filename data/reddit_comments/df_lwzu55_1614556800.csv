2,gpk3k2w,Go slap the HF back on S 0 S. Short squeeze in full effect right now. DD dropped. They have shorted over a hundred million more shares since DD dropped. They can't stop this train. $40 predicted value. That's after the dust settles.

5,gpk4fzn,"Actually, i need to sell at peaks better....but stay in for long term but not YOLO all of it.   I didnt time the peaks right because, low experience but ok....

If I have 100, sell 40@180 and then buy 40 back at 120 I am covering my losses and in the game free if done enough, and timed right and able to truly hold without fear.  That was the plan....

Ape executed.

Not financial advise obviously.   I am a retard",-2,0,1614794430,milkbone_finger
