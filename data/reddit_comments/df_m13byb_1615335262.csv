0,gqe4csa,Same. Last time I got greedy and thought I’d go all in at 38 and thus missed my rocket. I won’t make the same mistake twice. Worst case I have to wait 10 years for my money back.,1,0,1615335584,lead_alloy_astray

5,gqebpg3,The thing with selling in the way down rather than making limit orders is that you're beholden to whatever technological obstacles come in your way - since everyone's going to be using the same 3 or 4 websites it wouldn't be surprising if the websites get hugged to death.,1,0,1615339493,BlasphemousJester

11,gqeeff2,"Today I was telling the friend who introduced me to investing about holding my $20k GME investment through a $16k drawdown, and finally being back in profit today, and he said, ""That's some stones, holding through that"", and I was like, what? It wasn't hard, I'm just so used to seeing selling stigmatized, I forgot it was still an option, to normal people.",1,0,1615340941,ApopheniaPays
12,gqeerfa,"You guys hold on (and I say that for entertainment purposes only, Not Intended As Financial Advice, I Am A Dumb Ape.) I bought at $320, instead of selling I averaged down to $203 by buying way more than I planned to own and worrying my ass off for a couple of weeks, and today the rocket finally came back to pick me up today, and I'm soooooo glad I held.",1,0,1615341119,ApopheniaPays

16,gqeirz7,"I'll take the compliment, thanks! Bought in this round at $320, averaged down to $203 as price dropped by buying way too fucking much, diamond-handed the whole way, sweated a little I admit, and, crossed back above break-even today!

I'll tell you the only time I was even remotely tempted: yesterday at session close, after a max drawdown of $16000 a few weeks ago, I was only about $1200 down. I kind of had to grit my teeth. But I looked at the 4h chart and it was \*gorgeous\*. No way I was going to sell a thing. 

So I woke up early today to watch my holdings come back into profit, and by the end of the day, far enough beyond that to feel really comfortable (and posted a Gain post which a mod dutifully deleted immediately ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval). Oh, well, their ways are inscrutable to us mortals.) 

At this point I might put in some low trailing stops to take just a VERY little profit out. My very lowest buys, when I was down 80%, did what they were meant to, and I would like to de-risk and lower my cost basis a bit more just to sleep better at night.  

But I didn't come this far to break even, or to puss out for a couple grand. There'll be plenty of other chances to make a couple thousand dollars. This is a once-in-a-lifetime play for me.",2,0,1615343276,ApopheniaPays

19,gqelojw,"Unless they own most of the call contracts from 250 on up there's no way the HFs will be able to make a controlled rise to 500. There's 4000 calls @ 250 that expire this week just to start off the gamma fun. If it gets much over 250 this week, especially Friday. We're going to see a gamma squeeze and then it'll probably head back down again.",1,0,1615344851,Leafy0
