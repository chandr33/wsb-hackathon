0,gqd5d0m,$1000 seems possible. $10k is outlandish. You have to compare the market cap to c rypto because it is very similar in psychology. I think it’s a dead cat bounce and will fall short of previous ath and die off this round but if institutions short it again later down the road it may be a recurring thing and could go higher next round...,-3,0,1615319131,rayjensen
