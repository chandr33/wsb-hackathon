11,gqgzhjt,"Directly after a huge sell off they froze it, leaving no way to counteract the sell. My question is how is that specifically a legal act? From what I'm seeing they did it to AMC as well.",1,0,1615398687,cfan89
12,gqh08yx,I'm a complete retard but my understanding is that it's simply a built-in protection in the system.  The drop triggered an automatic pause in trading because it was so dramatic.  I'd guess they use that time to check if there is malfeasance or a glitch and if nothing readily appears they start it back up.,1,0,1615398926,Nogster
