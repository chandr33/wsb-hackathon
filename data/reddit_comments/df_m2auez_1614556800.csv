When they find out who the winner is that's the one that gets sent to the presses. That's just how marketing and advertising works, we have things planned out far far in advance for various outcomes.

Maybe they also had an inverted article about it totally exploding they would have used if it went in the other direction. I don't know the truth. But it could very well just be fear mongering and market manipulation at its finest.

9,gqi6b17,"The dude started writing an article at 11:55am.

 By the time he finished his original article, the stock changed direction, so he went back and changed the article completely.

What you see there is the publish time of the original article, before it was completely changed.

When using blog software, if you edit an article, you need to manually change the published date/time.

Most content creators are too inexperienced to notice that the publish time should even be updated.

If you view source on the web page, you might see an ""updated date"" meta tag somewhere, which will show that the page was edited at a different time.",13,0,1615416836,SuicideIsSoSexyRrrrr
10,gqi6bzc,"How do you explain the article coming out before the drop, reporting-- specifically, that the drop was 1/3 of the stock's prices?

Are you telling me that they are writing articles ahead of time for not only the stock movements up and down but also articles for exact amounts of rises or falls? No way, dude.

 If DavidNIO's screenshot is real, which it appears to be, then this is clear evidence of manipulation. I could believe your argument, this is definitely a common practice of the media. That having been said, the article specifically stating one-third of the stock value lost, and that it came long out before GME hit that number, is super suspicious in my opinion.",6,0,1615416849,Bye_Triangle

That this is being manipulated as heavily as it is shouldn't be a shock to anyone, honestly. They are literally BLEEDING out millions and millions every day. OFC they're going to try and get people scared, there will be all sorts of tactics and they will WORK. The same ""I have diamond hands"" people will cash out as soon as it hits $600, mark my words.

From a business perspective it makes total sense. Since a drop is obviously possible, and likely, it makes sense to prepare the article in advance with some generic info, then auto populate it with the actual data when a certain event occurs.
