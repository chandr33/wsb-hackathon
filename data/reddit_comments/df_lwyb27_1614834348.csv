Fuck‚Äôem and fuck your wife‚Äôs boyfriend too. Disclaimer: this isn‚Äôt any kind of advice.

47,gpoae14,"Hey, the story is obviously more complicated than I've made it out to be in a single sentence, and results are influenced, as with many psychological experiments, by the framing.  

Here's three articles to get you started: 

- https://www.wired.com/story/why-are-rich-people-so-mean/

- https://newrepublic.com/article/120092/billionaires-book-review-money-cant-buy-happiness

- https://theconversation.com/are-the-rich-more-selfish-than-the-rest-of-us-74803

The articles reference his work, but if you want some specific studies, look up Dacher Keltner. 

It seems to depend, once you get beyond the framing, about the people you're actually in contact with. Being surrounded by wealth *generally* makes you less generous. Incidentally, this is why I've never been too bothered by the salaries of football players (im from the UK, so soccer if you're American), because they often come from poor backgrounds and spend a lot of time giving back to those backgrounds - as opposed to most people working in a hedge fund.",2,0,1614878932,LearningHistoryIsFun
