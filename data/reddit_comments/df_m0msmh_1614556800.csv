7,gq8owu7,"I have seen this mentioned in a couple other posts. If they let the price dips we can grab more shares but if it stays level or goes up that's less shares for us to grab, but multiplied by the amount of redditors (and non redditors) who get the stimmy, well that's shit ton more either way for us to grab.
