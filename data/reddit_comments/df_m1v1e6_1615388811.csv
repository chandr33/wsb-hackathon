9,gqga8as,"1. Remember ""Stocks always go up""
2. Stop trying to analyse or make sense of anything - the market is a huge casino and we are pawns
3. Ignore valuations - don't even look at market cap - it literally means nothing in todays market
4. Jump on trend trains and diamond hands (GME,AMC,NIO,RKT)
5. Buy every single dip on every single stock/index you like (Stocks always go up)
6. Ignore the media - when they are panicking and bearish is a time to buy - when everything is bullish and they are saying everything is overvalued then its also time to buy
