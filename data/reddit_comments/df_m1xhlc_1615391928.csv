89,gqghl8j,"But for real, thanks ya'll. The rest of my shares are on this rocket, locked in tight.

I had bought at $295 something when I struggled to get cash into my RH account when they limited GME sales and all that nonsense and ultimately had a big buy in. I got to average down on Fidelity by buying in at the $100 pricepoints. Roughly 60 stock for roughly $6000 total. Plus some losses from a put when I hedged against this strong, slow and steady rise that cost me another $600.

I set a sell limit for just over $302 today for just enough shares to break even, and we already hit 304 high according to RH. I am now net positive on all of GME. I don't care if this ship falls back down to $0, I still win.
