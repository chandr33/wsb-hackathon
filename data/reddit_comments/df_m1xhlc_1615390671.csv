1,gqgeh3b,"They absolutely, positively cannot justify this with increasing actual real-world business. The hype that they're going to pivot to more e-business pretends there aren't a dozen established platforms that already do that. I think anyone saying to buy and hold indefinitely is just contributing to a pump-and-dump scheme whether they know it or not.   
Though at the same time the initial huge short positions that preceded this ordeal were equally manipulative from the other direction. Sure Gamestop was losing market share rather than gaining, but not necessarily on the way to bankruptcy any time soon. The short sellers were starting a craze to try to squish them prematurely.",2,0,1615390672,SonOfMcGee

13,gqgehli,"You use your eyes dude there is no magic math here. Watch the stock live. Here's an exaggerated example, let's say you are waiting for it to go past 300. You watch it live and it hits 299.99 and then drops down to 295 in a few seconds. Then it goes back up to 299.99 and drops back down to 297. Then it goes back to 299.99 and drops back to  293. Do you see the ""sell wall""? Usually happens when people have limit sells at 300 so their orders keep getting filled at that price. Once it goes past the ""sell wall"" it's usually all up hill from there until the next one at let's say 350 or 400",1,0,1615390678,AutomaticBias
