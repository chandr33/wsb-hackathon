14,gpprys8,"lmao I flipped some 170$ 4/16 Calls for a quick 900$ profit right at the day start. And then I lost 1,650$ trying to do it again at 170$ 4/23. I just don't understand the market forces driving the TGT price so I can't really give a good suggestion here.",2,0,1614902449,dick_himmel
15,gpprz73,I'm fairly new to this (I invest my 401k in ETFs). I placed my first option today on SKT. Learning as I go along. I like ASO might throw something that way too.,6,0,1614902455,LORDOFTHEFATCHICKS
16,gpprzaz,"At this point we don't even need memes for it to be meme stock.  All it takes is to be mentioned casually throughout the day before MSM picks up and  loses their minds that reddit is balls deep in it.

Look I wish I was the paranoid type and could attribute what I just said to tinfoil, I really do but come on the writing is on the wall here at this point.   If you're one of the lucky ones ""in on it"" early enough you are laughing your ass off shopping for homes in delightful Island nations right now I swear to fuck but if you sleep even 5 minutes too long, you're at the tops going ""you guys coming back for me right? Right? Guys...""

The cycle moves so fast, that I'm pretty sure time itself is being squashed on the backend going forward to prop this current state of affairs up.

If I'm wrong I'm wrong, come at me tomorrow and let me know.",28,0,1614902457,Ok_Entrepreneur_5833
