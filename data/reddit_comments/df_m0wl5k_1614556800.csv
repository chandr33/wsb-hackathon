6,gqaagug,"They tried to put in one in my home state of WV, about six years ago. One of the legislators had a Honda dealership and hated electric cars, he got all of buddies to vote no. Good ol’ WV, shoot yourself in the foot and blame the other guy.",4,0,1615257603,OffKilterOffer
7,gqaahbg,"Yeah, how an entire state can forget that numbers keep going lower than 30 is beyond me. But him building a storage unit down here means those outages won’t be as bad. Also it’s going to be used to store green energy which doesn’t typically freeze over like liquid gas or oil, at least when made properly which we can assume Elon would do. 

And yeah we prolly should be on the federal energy grid, especially after this.",1,0,1615257610,TheFondestComb
8,gqabtfq,"Tesla knows the battery-fication of the electric grid in the next few decades is where the real money is. Battery farms will replace natural gas peaking plants to ""back up"" intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar. Building cars gives them market power now to secure long term lithium and nickel supplies but the future profit will be coming from home and grid scale solar and battery storage.",2,0,1615258353,Elchup15
