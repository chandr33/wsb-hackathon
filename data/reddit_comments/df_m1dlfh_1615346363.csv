13,gqeu1nn,"They are definitely different types of accounts.

Don't underestimate the ability to roll over / convert funds to Roth.  At the very least if you work at a job that has a Roth 401(k) you can roll over all your Roth funds to a Roth IRA when you leave.  That, combined with your 6k contribution (or, if you are not eligible, a ""backdoor"" contribution through a non-deductible IRA contribution and then a conversation) allows you to funnel a lot more funds into the Roth than the contribution limit.  That might (for some people) more than offset the withdrawal restrictions.",1,0,1615349732,Keith_13

32,gqf49qg,"Read it again - you are penalized for going past the contribution limits.

For the sake of argument letâ€™s say I have $100,000 and have never opened a TFSA. 

I can open one today and put $75,500 in, that is the culmination of contribution room since the TFSA came into existence (and I was 18 at the time, so I accrued that room every year). 

If I put all $100,000 in, Iâ€™ll be penalized 1% (per month I believe) interest on $24,500 - the over contributions.

Likewise, if I put in 75,500 and then turn that into 100,000 by July, then take out 50,000 I cannot put any money back in.  Contribution room doesnâ€™t reset until Jan. 1st.  Come Jan 1 2022 Iâ€™d have an additional $56000 in room (50k for what I took out plus the yearly 6k). 

You do not pay any tax for withdrawing the money youâ€™ve made in the TFSA. 

In THEORY if you grew you 75,500 to 1 million and then withdrew your 1 million, the next year on Jan 1 you would have 1,006,000 of contribution room and not have to pay any taxes.",1,0,1615356974,Tower-Union
