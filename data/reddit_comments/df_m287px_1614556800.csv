3,gqhsxd3,Earnings report in Q4 was disappointing by all reports,1,0,1615410736,jamesky61
4,gqhtft8,"Revenue beat expectations. EPS missed only due to large Q4 non-cash items as follows:

Net Loss: $(182.3)M

Stock Comp (Non-Cash, no cost to company): $106.4M
Debt Extinguishment (Non-Cash, no cost to company): $103.0M
Depreciation &amp; Amortization (Non-Cash): $99.8M

That is almost $127M in cash-flow, and actually much higher because I didn't remove other non-cash expenses that are inflated such as Interest or Taxes. But the company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $195M to give you a better approximation of cashflow. My personal take is that other shareholders are reacting to the price action (heavily influenced by shorts) rather than the report. Lack of guidance is also frustrating some, but they said results will be substantially on par with Q4 2020.

I added more today. Good luck to you whether you follow me or not!",4,0,1615410962,TimmyTiggles

The issue is the volume for this stock isn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs a shell company. We don‚Äôt know what it does. It‚Äôs own by institutional investors they can call it whatever they want and lie about it on filing.",1,0,1615412832,Red_Master

22,gqi1ilz,"Wrong. First, Muddy Waters claimed they were losing UnitedHealth only, which is their biggest customer (35% of revenues). But MultiPlan confirmed that Q3 2020 revenues INCREASED with UnitedHealth quarter-over-quarter. For Q4 2020 they would not comment on individual customers, but they stated their top ten customers (which drive 80% of revenue) had growth. Q4 results would not have been stronger than Q3 2020 if UnitedHealth was closing up their business with Multiplan.

EDIT: And by the way, if you do more than 5 minutes of research on Naviguard (UnitedHealth's supposedly ""competing"" product) you will see that it is not a substitute for MultiPlan's claim validation solutions. It is a consumer advocacy service in a lot of ways.",1,0,1615414542,TimmyTiggles
