Deficiencies can be a result of diet, meal size, time between meals, or gastrointestinal disorders. If your dog has started eating poop but didn‚Äôt before, it‚Äôs worth asking your vet about it. 

If your dog suffers from separation anxiety or is lacking in mental stimulation this could also be a reason for eating poop. Sometimes dogs just like the smell and taste.
