65,gphci95,"It mooned today. Where were you a week ago homie? 

It looks like it is losing market share in a growing market and it only bounced today because of the attention to the mortgage brokerage companies. 

The business model is dated, as far as I can tell and they may have ""killed"" it on their quarterly but they need to go Daywalker to put the life back into their business.

I missed the boat on $rkt. There wasn't enough time for me to do my own DD before jumpin on board I wish you luck on your trade but I will pass on this unless I find out they are making some serious changes to their model...

...and honestly I cant find a meme for it. Maybe use a clip from driving ms. Daisy.

Edit: okay I maybe a little critical about it but why not have a bearish take on it before you spill 10k into something. 

I went to their website and it's not really clear what they offer.

I know rocket mortgage can get me a mortgage fast. I know their brand and I know they are easy. So when I'm comparing I'm comparing to rocket. Sorry but still a pass on both for me. Y'all have fun though.",4,0,1614733116,P1ckl2_J61c2
