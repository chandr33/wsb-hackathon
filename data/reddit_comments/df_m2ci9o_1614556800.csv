no, not yet i didn't expect the stock to bounce ~~but~~ back to 250 so quickly. i had my heart broke last month so i prepared myself to have a stop loss. ~340 -&gt; ~240 (within an hour or so and never went back up for another month)",8,0,1615420435,spellbadgrammargood

13,gqiei29,"my goes against my stock philosophy/paranoia. so today it reached a high of ~340. imagine if it went to 300, and it triggered my stop loss. so i would profit but what if it turned around at 299 and skyrocketed.

i'm an all or nothing (or break even) type of guy. i didn't know stop losses would screw you over on volatile stocks thought, lesson learned",8,0,1615421009,spellbadgrammargood

45,gql1fqs,"Or you can not sell while it goes to 40 and stays there for 3 fucking weeks while everyone, including 99% of the people who tell you not to sell and turn off your stop loss now will be mocking you and saying it's your own fault for being an unironic retard. It's easy to say that in hindsight, after it goes green again. If your stop loss nets you more than what you've invested - you put that shit on, if your broker have trailing stop loss you put that shit on and forget about it. This is how you get money as a simple retard. If you're present at the screen, when they hit your stop losses by another swing, you buy at a lower price when it start rallying back up. If it doesn't then you got your money back with a bonus. If you're greedy POS you get a fucking empty bag if the next ""Swing"" is going to be a killer one and they keep price at the low point for another month, and instead of buying back @40 you sit on your whole liquidity at the peek. Amount of people who held an empty bag through January and whole February proves there is nothing wrong with what you did. It's the forces we are against are just too strong. Don't be an unironic retard, look after yourself. People who tell you to disable stop loss are those who got in at fucking 40 or at 4 since August last year. These people are not your friends. They ride till it moons or they just multiple their liquidity several fold. They will be the same people who will take a huge dump in your mouth afterwards.
