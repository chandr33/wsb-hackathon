7,gplfyom,RKT nor GME are new to wsb. They both go a while back. I think a lot of new people that started this year aren't used to making or losing a lot of money day to day. They likely believe if someone buys GME they wont buy RKT and they will somehow lose money by being the last bag holder. It's silly and before it gets better it'll likely become a little worse.,1,0,1614815711,CoronaPooper

12,gplgrjp,"I agree about DFV. 

I'm just not yet persuaded personally on the technicals - the short interest, how much and how often they doubled down on their/new short positions. Plus again it seems like they're trying hard to dissuade people from buying $GME, which to me is an indicator. 

But idk, I'm not as savvy about this stuff than most other people on this sub, but that's the thing, most of the voices here which I find to be most wise and respected seem to think this is FAR from over. There's someone in a side-discord I'm in who is quite confident consolidating his $multi-million portfolio into only $GME shares, and he strikes me as both intuitive and hardened. 

I'm inclined to trust the sentiment of the community, which includes that if another squeeze doesn't happen, the shorts still have a lot of unraveling to do, turning $GME into a long-term hold play. So WORST CASE scenario is you make money slowly?",5,0,1614816129,da_muffinman

18,gpljxfq,"The only thing I don't like seeing is posts saying they sold all their GME to go all in on RKT. It just kinda reads like someone saying (especially to new WSB members) that GME is dead so on to the next thing. I don't care if you YOLO your account on any stock, but no need to put others down.

Goes for GME gang too, I don't really need to know you sold your boomer stocks or whatever, just that you bought more GME.

20,gpll1m5,There were weeks where this sub was totally overran with non GME content but the share price only went down to about 40- so I don‚Äôt think the RKT hype is a threat to GME.

27,gpln1zn,It's been way too long that this sub has refused to realize that all retail investments combined account for less than 8% of Gamestop shares. Just the top 10 investors (all big players) make up 92% of shares held. The GME squeeze was a HUGE windfall for Blackrock who made more than anyone browsing Reddit. The narrative this is all driven by retail investors is much more interesting but unfortunately not the case.,1,0,1614819755,MyUsernameIsJudge
