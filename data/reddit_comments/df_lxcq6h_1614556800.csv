51,gpnappo,"[Benzinga](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallstreetbets-eyes-tanger-factory-outlet-050854231.html) claims SKT is ""the top-trending stock in the community in the near-term"". Really ridiculous article

Edit: just realized we're talking about the same article probably.

Guess I'll break down why this is so sus since I can't sleep

Top trending in the near-term is pretty loose phrasing but I can't see how it could ever be considered that. They posted a picture where they just searched SKT and screencapped the results, but the biggest post of all is only like 750 points. Apparently a 600 comment volume is enough to claim the entire community is making this move.

Random picture of a comment with 1 upvote, people who don't use reddit will see this and have no idea how invisible comments like these are. But of course the top comments are people confused by where this is coming from.

Related link at the bottom of the article: GameStop Short-Selling Fame's Melvin Posts 20% Returns For February. Not sure about MCs short positions on SKT but this seems to be misleading that GME is over and SKT is next.
