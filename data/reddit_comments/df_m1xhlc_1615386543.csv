24,gqg5ek6,"A few months ago my dad calls and checks if I’m doing alright, seeing my account is a little low. He’s been listed on my bank account since we created it together for me over 10 years ago when I was 16, just because.
I tell him yeah I had moved some stuff around because, well, GME was cooking and I liked the stock. He didn’t quite understand but told me to be careful and not to throw away anything I couldn’t afford to lose. He’s an ape at heart he just doesn’t know it.

Anyway, a month later and a few more paychecks and I average down while GME drops. I think I was at like, 20 averaged at 100 or so. Nothing incredible, but I had some faith. Talk to my dad again and he asks how it’s doing (he had since heard about the bad february and was curious what I had done) and I told him to have faith. In so many words I explained 💎 🙌. He laughs it off and says be careful.

One week ago, he calls again, and the conversation changes to GME once again rising. He says hey Yanno you were right, good job, how much did you make?
I explain there’s no exit plan and we’re in this until the moon (well, I told him the value in it could be much higher and it’d be foolish to let go now or anytime soon) and then he gets really serious.

""You’re telling me this is gonna keep going up?""
""Yeah dad, this is gonna keep going up.""

He then tells me he’s giving me $3,000 and to double it, but no pressure and he loves me either way. For a second over the phone Im blown away, that’s more than I’ve had to invest at any point in my life. It’s nothing huge, but that’s way more than I usually run around with Yanno?

""Dad you won’t regret this. I trust this stock.""
""I don’t trust that stock for shit. But I trust you.""

I got my dad in for 23 shares at around 130. He thinks he’s getting double, if anything. He doesn’t realize this is a moon ride.
I’m not just diamond handing to fuck the hedges, I’m diamond handing to give back to the greatest man I know. Love you dad.",2,0,1615386552,heathypoop
