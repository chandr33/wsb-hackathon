I'm sure I COULD get better at selling covered options, but I've only had bad experiences, versus my consistently good experiences buying calls/stocks, then offloading them for a 10-50% profit (except GME/RKT, which was more like 100-200%).

18,gpkb2ph,"sorry, but you're just wrong that there can't be any P&amp;D here because it's in the rules and the market cap is to prevent it.  
The market cap is there to *mitigate* it by preventing the ones that are easy; nothing, other than removing posts, can prevent people from attempting it outright.  
Yes, you are correct that the majority of what's going on is institutional and big players, but to just blanket state that it's impossible for people to post over the top hype and influence a couple million people to buy more, or hold when their instincts are telling them not to, is just wrong.  
And to say that a few million people jumping in and buying more isn't going to have any effect on the SP is just stupid.  It won't have a huge effect, no.  We can't P&amp;D it without the institutional money in it, no.  But we can exaggerate it to an extent.  
  
The reason I have, and will continue to, call some of these things P&amp;D is quite simple - whether you *can* effectively P&amp;D has nothing to do with whether you're *trying* to.  
IMO, if you're telling people to hold, fine.  That's not P&amp;D.  If you're posting over the top hype, making wild claims, disingenuously spinning numbers, and practically begging people to buy more buy more buy more - you are trying to P.  Whether you can be successful is irrelevant.  You're trying.  And whenever someone's engaging in that, my view is going to tend toward you're doing it so you can hopefully D.

Also, aside from his beautiful wrinkly brain, the #1 reason for DFV's success (and Michael Burry's in That Movie, for that matter) is that he had conviction in his DD and he was **patient.**  If *those* geniuses weren't able to pick out a specific date (and, in fact, were way too early and were ostensibly losing money for a long time), why would you think that a random redditor can?

I learned back then that [""Mongoloid""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_idiocy) was one of the first medical terms assigned to people with exceptionally low intelligence and specifically people with downs syndrome. Idiot was a replacement for mongolian idiocy but also fell out of favor. There's a long list of replacement terms and each one eventually falls out of favor as it becomes derogatory eventually through misuse. Even the term autistic is on its way out as it has become a common insult used by children. In fact ""consumer"" was briefly used but already gone which is a shame as I liked that one!
