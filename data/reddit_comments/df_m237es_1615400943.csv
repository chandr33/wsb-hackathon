55,gqh5m28," I started investing on Jan 7th of this year with $114 as my initial investment. I always thought investing was for smart people and old people so I never tried to start. I owned 9 shares of GME before the dip to $45. I somehow convinced my wife to let me spend $2500 on GME which is a lot for us since we are saving for a house. I now own 45 @ 90.59. We've been living in the in-laws' basement for almost a year now saving It's been a long and tough year for us. But seeing GME rise has given both me and my wife hope again. Because of you guys and gals, we will be able to buy a house and start a family. There are a lot of good people in this sub. From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful. You helped my dream come true.
