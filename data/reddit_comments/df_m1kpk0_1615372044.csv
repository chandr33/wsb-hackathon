70,gqi49dd,"\&gt;  It has the potential to make you fantastic gains, it also has the potential to remove those gains in 1/2 an hour. Its stressful but it is currently worth it. You need to understand not to sell at a peak, and not to sell when you see a minor dip. Volatile stocks Climb and Fall ALL DAY LONG. What you are looking for is a constant gain through the peaks and dips. Set a limit....say 500$.....If the stock is climbing then dips 200$ don't worry but pay attention.

In retrospect, this is amazing advice",1,0,1615415841,heymelio-fagabeefe
