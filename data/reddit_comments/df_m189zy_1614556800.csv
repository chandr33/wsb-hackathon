77,gqegmbr,"Let me preface this by saying I'm bullish on AMD but you're connecting dots that don't make sense. Biden can't do anything about the shortage for a least a few years. A small percentage of semiconductors get produced in the US anyways. Su also said last year that the shortage would be over early 2021, well it's early 2021 and it's not over. There has been news more recent than her statement saying the shortage would last into 2022 so I wouldn't count on mid 2021. Once the supply finally does catch up sure they will make a lot of money but once the pent up demand is met there will be an oversupply as there was in 2018. The shortage has hampered AMD's ability to take advantage of their better chips. Intel spent nearly 14B on R&amp;D in 2020, I can only imagine that will go up. For reference AMD spent 2B. Intel will catch up eventually, and they still dominate market share for CPU's, laptops, and servers.",0,0,1615342120,austin_jp17
78,gqeliyl,"Intel just doesn‚Äôt have the same growth potential as AMD, but like I said in the post I don‚Äôt think INTC is going to become obsolete or anything. It also goes without saying that Intel would have deeper pockets than AMD since INTC has quadruple the market cap.

Having too much demand for your product is one of the better problems you could have as a company, and AMD has been reporting good earnings and future guidance despite the shortage, which seems like regardless of when exactly you think will be over, will definitely ease up in the coming months/year.",1,0,1615344766,DestroyerOfPussy69
79,gqem7o4,"The fact that you literally cannot buy next gen graphics cards at less than 2x msrp means there is HUGE market share to seize that the production capacity simply does not exist to serve.

80,gqeo00e,I think the backlog is an issue for AMD because they are the underdog. Their chips have a large competitive advantage but no one can get ahold of them so the perception isn't changing. The top laptop lines still have intel stickers plastered on them and people who aren't paying attention to tech still think of Intel as top dog and AMD as the great value option. So imo the backlog gives Intel time to catch up. I also was waiting to see what intel's new ceo is going to do.,1,0,1615346157,austin_jp17
81,gqeopg4,"Amd is definitely a buyer. The issue is this is potentially a decade long investment. 

Imo problem is the process of replacing existing product. We‚Äôve been using intel product for so long that it‚Äôs going to be a while for amd‚Äôs competitive advantage to truly replace intel. Looking at their product this will happen eventually because amd cpu is outright better, but it needs time to happen.

Also , dont count on amd fighting against nvda. The only reason amd gpu can offer a better bang for buck is because nvda never even tried. Theres just no competition. The 3000 series has shown that nvda still has so much potential capabilities it dwarfs whatever amd makes in at least 5 years.",2,0,1615346560,Fangslash
82,gqephsn,"My 400 shares &amp; several Apr21 &amp; Jun21 calls agree with this sentiment.

Also, for reals. I work in data storage. We're ONLY using AMD CPUs in our upcoming products. It's really simple reason why. Lanes &amp; Cost.

See INTC did this shitty thing, where their CPUs don't have that many accessory PCIe lanes for PCIe adaptor cards. Not to mention, where the fuck is INTC on PCIe G4 CPUs? So if you want the lanes you need you HAVE to get a dual processor motherboard. What does that do? Let's Intel make double the money on motherboards they sell and other Mobo vendors sell.

So what does AMD do. Come out with a single CPU with all then lanes you would need to address 20 PCIe G4 NVMe devices and 2 x16 100GbE NICs in a single CPU. And, it's FUCKING CHEAPER than a comparable INTEL CPU. Did I mention, now I don't have to deal with NUMA domains due to the single proc solution. AMD's ROME CPU architecture is just superior to Intel.

Oh did I also mention how AMD implements Intel's SW libraries so if your SW relies on one of them, it's just plug and play with AMD.

I dream of edging to Lisa Su's face. AMD is something I literally can't wait to hold for 5 years.",2,0,1615347011,MoonRei_Razing
