13,gqdx9tp,"I have calls on UNFI too, so I hope it skyrockets, but I'd appreciate a quick $5 dip. 

Last March there were definitely reasons to be bullish on a food supplier at the beginning of a pandemic. Now? I'm not so sure. mid-June COVID cases were relatively low and there hadn't been any recent injection of money into the economy, so traditional stock move of decline on good earnings might have been more easily applied than it is now. Comparing the current market to any other time probably doesn't make any sense anyways. We're in the twilight zone right now.",2,0,1615331894,bugsorbust

Just today:

 

* Else announces that it has listed its Plant-Based Complete Nutrition for toddlers, with United Natural Foods (**UNFI**), as a core partner for Grocery distribution across the United States.
* Reports Q2 (Jan) earnings of $1.25 per share, excluding non-recurring items, **$0.44** **better than** the S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.81; revenues rose 12.2% year/year to $6.89 bln vs the $6.92 bln S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus.
* Co **reaffirms guidance** for FY21, sees EPS of $3.05-3.55 vs. $3.17 S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus; sees FY21 revs of $27.0-27.8 bln vs. $27.23 bln S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus.
