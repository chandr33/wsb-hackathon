On the way down it hit your stop loss of $185, but it doesn't guarantee a sale of 185 unless you set it that way. So while it activated once it hit $185, it dropped so quickly that it couldn't sell until $180. For what you can do? You can try buying back in if you want but it's already back up to the $260 range at the time of typing this.
