30,gqhpg7a,"This is simply not true. First, lemme say I‚Äôve been holding GME at $300+. I‚Äôm not a shill, and nor am I a fan of CNBC and how they‚Äôve been covering this.

BUT, the fact that they published an article about today‚Äôs rise and dip in 20 mins isn‚Äôt ‚Äúproof‚Äù CNBC is colluding with hedgies (I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt I‚Äôm saying OP‚Äôs reasoning is flawed).

Having worked as a journalist a few years ago (no longer, thank god), it is entirely possible for a professional journalist to pump out an article in 20 mins. You have to realize that CNBC most likely has a team of researchers and writers and editors on JUST the GME stuff. They have TEAMS of people whose job for the past couple of months would have been to keep an eye on this stock. They most likely had statistics and quotes ready to publish. Note how the quotes are from their own airtime, it‚Äôs not like they had to call up someone and get a quote (which isn‚Äôt that impossible to do within 20 mins either)

Again, I‚Äôm not defending the hedgies or CNBC, but this is just tinfoil hat theory and we should stop with these rampant speculations.",22,0,1615409239,3ananafish
