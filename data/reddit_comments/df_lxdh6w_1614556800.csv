They pulled all the tricks to make you stay but all the comforts of easy UI/UX and extra of this and little of that is a simplification of giving you less choices.

Sometimes over-complication is not the answer, but this is your money and you should have the best judgement and control over how you should manage it.

As far as I understand it, they had to **raise** money to meet clearing house requirements to allow them the next day. 

Beyond that, from what I know, which is little, they make the bulk of their money from order flow payments, which, unless I’m crazy, would’ve been cut in half on a day where they only allow half of the orders to occur.
