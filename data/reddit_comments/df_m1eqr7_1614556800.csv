**Bad Positions Screenshot**

^Posts ^only

^Reported ^as: ^Bad ^Positions ^Screenshot

Screenshots of your positions must show equity or losses of more than $2,500 or $10,000 USD for options or stocks respectively. We don't just want a % change chart. If your title has to include ""position in comments"" then it's a bad screenshot.",-5,0,1615321030,PMMEURTHROWAWAYS
