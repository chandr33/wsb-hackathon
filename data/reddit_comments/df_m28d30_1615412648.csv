6,gqhxc11,Honestly anyone who thinks retail is really behind this run is an idiot.  Institutions are the ones controlling all of this.  While people were patting themselves on the back for 'sticking it to the hedgies' they didn't realize other hedge funds were making a fuck ton of money because of it going up.,10,0,1615412663,dekd22

29,gqhxeeo,"it is approaching where hedgies shorted from the peak on the 27th. The next couple of days will be brutal and very volatile. I fully expect them to bring the price up so we go mid 300s again and they just push it back down. They cant let it break 400 this week otherwise too many calls expire ITM. Next week they're going to do the same but every time probably going to short on the downturn. Notice how fast it dropped like 100 dollars? no retail trader could time that and they're counting on that. Honestly if u have shares ur fine as long as people dont paperhand. The squeeze will squeeze, they're just pushing it as far back as possible.

This is my personal opinion, anything is possible but from what the price action has been, 400s is a very heavy battle to break.",3,0,1615412693,ChampionM1

If you've rolled your calls over and over, you could have knocked your cost basis below $8 by now. Is this your first round of selling the calls?

If you're talking about 100 shares, first option sold, and you collected $474 on one call you sold, you would get $800 for the shares plus $474 premium = $1,274. You paid $1,100. You're earning the difference, $174. If you're talking about 200 shares, different math.

71,gqhxj03,"I think that's right, the most you could profit with that trade is $174 and that's if the stock drops to just below $8 so it expires worthless. You collect the premium up front then lose $300 from the shares dropping $3.

If it went up to $12, you collect $474 then make $100 so youre now at $574. They exercise at 8 so you lose $400, now you're at +$174 again

I'm missing something because I don't think both parties can profit. If so that would be super exploitable
