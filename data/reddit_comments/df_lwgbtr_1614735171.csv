61,gphn6uv,"I don’t think RKT is a purposely crafted distraction, just a coincidence. The company had their IPO a few months ago and after gaining value for a couple weeks it crashed, and since then has drawn a few hedge funds who have spent the last few months shorting it. However, it has backfired on the shorts for a few reasons, the biggest being that RKT’s execs aren’t fucking around and have decided to actively fuck over the shorts. In late November, RKT announced they intend to do a massive stock buy back of $1 billion worth of shares during Q1. This has yet to happen so it’s likely to occur in the very near future; current float is about 100M, so they intend to buyback roughly 25% of all outstanding stock. Then, during their Q4 earnings report on 2/25, they announced a special dividend of $1.1/share is going to be paid out to all holders at the end of market 3/9. On top of that, the shorts got noticed by the retail investors, having overplayed their hand again and irresponsibly pushed to 40% short interest. So now the shorts are stuck in a shitty position. If they don’t settle up their positions by 3/9, they’ll wind up having to cover that dividend, and on top of that retail is buying the stock up like crazy. Bonus, RKT is roughly 70% institutional ownership, and those firms are more than happy to throw fuel on the fire to burn their competitors attempting to short them.",121,0,1614738638,Captain_Sacktap
