5,gpnbjxp,Maybe not.  If the market falls 10 percent it will wipe the majority out.  Then the people just holding GME with all of their money will eventually get bored and leave.,1,0,1614862309,lonedirewolf21

8,gpne7ry,the new people are literally delusional too. they genuinely believe that other ppl in the sub selling affects the stock price. we are just a drop in the bucket and they genuinely believe that we have enough buying power to increase or decrease the stock,2,0,1614863983,Headline123
9,gpngmbe,"I don‚Äôt even mind the GMEtards circle jerking about it all day every day. What annoys me is when others make posts or comments about other tickers and get replies like ‚ÄúMelvin SHILL, this is an attempt to distract us from GME‚Äù.

22,gpnu2iq,"80% of the people here where not here 6 weeks ago. The old culture is completely saturated out by the new movement. The worst part is there‚Äôs now way for new users to see what the sub was like before this. 

Try sorting by top posts for the last year or all time, instead of getting a greatest hits highlight reel of the sub, it‚Äôs now hundreds of pages of gme low effort posts. The worst part is not that the culture has been pushed aside, it‚Äôs that our history has been erased.",1,1,1614871857,dicktingle
23,gpnumxo,"i really hate posts like this because its wallstreetBETs not wallstreetDD or wallstreetshill. you see a massive amount of posts on GME because its a HUGE fucking bet and never happened before in financial history of fucking course people are gonna talk about it and meme it.

I lurked for a couple of years on again and off again to come see the crazy shit happening. Like the kid who got a prostitute after winning some good money.

26,gpnzfa3,"Yeah, I dunno when this ""ape"" shit started, but it's annoying. It's like they use it to make it seem like they belong even though they don't and even if they're actually autistic.

Not as fast moving as wsb but sometimes good stuff comes up. Also if you notice similar tickers being upvoted across all the subs gives a good indication that its not just being overmemed as other subs may have stricter criteria",2,0,1614877789,kunell
