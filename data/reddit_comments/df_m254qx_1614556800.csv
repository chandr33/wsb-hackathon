2,gqh8rb6,"It's called freeriding since you purchased with unsettled funds. No legal consequences that I'm aware of but it is prohibited. That means e trade likely suspends your activity for 90 days unless you appeal that you're an idiot. 
I'm really stupid so please don't listen to me",2,0,1615402202,config_this
3,gqh9lmc,"I think that if you use unsettled funds (sold today) to make any purchase (same stock or not) you need to hold those newly purchased shares At Minimum until the funds are settled. Basically that's two business days, but you should be able to verify the settle date by looking at your trade history, and do not sell those new shares before that. If you do, you may get your account frozen for some period of time like 90 days?

I don't know, am dumb. Good luck!",1,0,1615402539,jasonsneezes
