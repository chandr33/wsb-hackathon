4,gqj9tbd,So yolo on 100 puts tomorrow?,2,0,1615438372,norealtalentshere
5,gqjacjd,"Interesting. Could very well be the case. The wording is very ambiguous. According to the original filing, March 12th should indeed be the date. The 8-k is poorly worded, it could be either the 12th or the 9th, but the wording favors the 9th I feel.

There were ~4M shares traded at the open on Tuesday. This is larger than expected if the shares didn‚Äôt unlock, but it‚Äôs not nearly what I‚Äôd expect if the shares did unlock.

Hard to say. Hope you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve got bear spreads on DASH",1,0,1615438743,Natural_Profession_8

I think it is the same as the IPO date. This is my main doubt...
In another location in the prospectus they rephrased the condition as 90 days from the IPO pricing date, which is the IPO date.",3,0,1615441990,chmod-007-bond
10,gqjha13,"Found it. The final prospectus is dated December 8th:

11,gqjiald,Nice work. So the early lock-up expiration **determination** date is at least after March 8th. Is that why 8-k say March 9th. Thus the actual expiration is March 12th? I don't see how this is wrong?! See table on page 261 of the final prospectus.,3,0,1615443405,chmod-007-bond
12,gqjioid,"Yeah, from the prospectus that seems to be the case. However, the prospectus also says the share price would have to be 25% over the IPO price on the day of the determination date. But the 8-k was filed before this info could be known. Maybe they‚Äôre allowed to change the terms of the early lockup?",1,0,1615443628,Natural_Profession_8

30,gql3s60,"I know what you mean and you are clearly correct hence the large correction, but trust me long term they‚Äôre not going anywhere. And short term I think this is roughly to bottom. To much capital sitting at the sidelines trying to get in under 130. Also the lock up has clearly been priced in, most employees who don‚Äôt have much financial knowledge (bar what they‚Äôre told by their own company) aren‚Äôt going to sell at what they would perceive to be 50% less than the value.

I'm convinced that this company shouldn't be valued more than Ebay -- thinking 120 or so but the stock market is being  crazy stupid right now... so anything goes. had the chance to offload the puts two days ago for 2K profit, but just gonna hold and see now -- may roll it back a couple of weeks and see what happens.",1,0,1615479816,Crepesoleswaffleknit
32,gql5gnv,"I didn't really thing that there were many other funds that would be looking to scoop up doordash as I think the company itself is pretty shitty. I'm not entirely convinced the lockup was priced in, but they're probably not going to sell all at once and crash the market.

34,gql7meq,"It‚Äôs pretty shitty but that‚Äôs like any new company they have the capital. The reason why I say the lock up was priced in is because realistically very few would actually sell and we already saw a huge correction. This coincided with the actual market correction which meant it fell even further than it should have. I agree it‚Äôs an overpriced company, but so is every company in this current market. And you‚Äôve got to remember the lower the price goes the less people that will sell, unless they‚Äôre actually retarded (not in the good way). They would have to do something completely fucked to lose their market share.

If I were to give it a realistic price target 155-165, long term would be higher. What price target would you give it?",2,0,1615480878,CanYouEvenCount
