This goes out to all the ~~women~~ **retards** in the world  
Especially ~~her~~ **you**  
You know it don't even matter your age  
Don't even matter yo color  
Yo fellas, I ain't forget about y'all  
This is for everybody who like to ~~dance~~ **gamble**  
Just listen to what I'm sayin'  
And do it  
And take a chance  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put your hand upon my hip  
When you dip I dip we dip  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put yours and I put mine  
And we can get ~~down low~~ **to the moon**  
And roll it round  
Just get on the ~~floor~~ **rocket** like I said before  
Y'all remember that down low  
Just put a little dip with it  
Now roll ~~those hips~~ **your savings** with it  
~~Pop~~ **buy** it, ~~push~~ **buy** it, ~~rock~~ **buy** it, ~~roll~~ **buy** it  
Can't control it? I can ~~hold~~ **hodl** it  
It's all in fun so take a chance  
Just get on the ~~floor~~ **rocket** and do that dance y'all  
I know you like it so don't try to fight it  
Turn around ~~baby~~ **Robinhood**, let me see it from the back  
Yeah, I like it like that  
Get up now  
Roll those ~~hips~~ **savings**  
Drop down double up on those dips  
~~Freak Nasty~~ **cmacpapi** wanna see  
Can y'all do this right upon me  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put your hand upon my hip  
When you dip I dip we dip  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put yours and I put mine  
And we can dip down low  
~~And roll it round~~ **then to the moon**  
Back again with the second verse  
It's all clean so I'm not gonna curse  
Droppin' ~~bass~~ **gains** like a bad habit  
Love ~~all women~~ **diamond hands**  
Cause I got to have it  
Comin' at y'all in stereo  
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo  
Hang on baby 'cause the ride is rough and (Yo ~~DJ~~ **DFV**, yo ~~DJ~~ **DFV**)  
Have them ~~girls~~ **tendies** in the front  
Now or later just ~~bumpin'~~ **muckin'** ~~that rump~~ **those tendies**  
Raise it up let me see ~~that round~~ **those tendies**  
Slap it ~~girl~~ **retards**, make it jiggle around  
Round and round ~~that rump~~ **my bank account** goes  
Where it stop yo, no one knows, yeah  
~~Freak Nasty~~ **cmacpapi** wanna see  
Can y'all do this right like me  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put your hand upon my hip  
When you dip I dip we dip  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put yours and I put mine  
And we can dip down low  
And roll it ~~round~~ **to fucking space**  
""Well all right y'all  
If you ain't dippin'  
You must be trippin'  
If you ain't doin the down low, you gots to go  
To the ~~people~~ **paperhands** that's movin' slow on the dance flo'  
Yo ~~DJ~~ **DFV** Pump it up some more  
""It's off to the show in the limo  
Before the show gotta get that dough  
~~Pay~~ **Ride** them ~~girls~~ **dips** what they worth  
Slip that ~~money~~ **tendies** under that skirt  
Take ~~it~~ off, ~~baby~~ **rocket** let me see  
You might get a little more loot chi-chi **(?lol)**  
~~Shorty~~ **GME** got it on like moms  
Teasin' me and she know I'm starvin'  
~~Lick you~~ **stock go** up then ~~like you~~ **stock go** down  
But I ain't finished ~~girl~~ **Robinhood**, turn around  
Lick you up and down your back'  
Cause I'm that freaky, I'm freaky like that  
~~Freak Nasty~~ **cmacpapi** wanna see can y'all do this (Right like me)  
I put my hand upon your hip  
When I dip you dip we dip  
You put your hand upon my hip  
When you dip I dip we dip
