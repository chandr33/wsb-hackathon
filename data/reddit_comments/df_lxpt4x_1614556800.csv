2,gpo9rek,"I completely disagree. I've been loading up on CCL. They've done a good job with debt management, liquidated some assets (sold ships) to lower overhead, and have tons of built up demand. People are itching for a vacation post pandemic. I think the stock will double a year from now.",29,0,1614878665,ndmunic
3,gpo9vol,I sold 13 cc weeklys @25.5 on all my shares laat friday before close expecting flat or a drop and here we are. Got $1.38 for each contract though so i made almost 27.3 off each share really. Not buying back in until low 20s,1,0,1614878716,tossserouttt3483726
4,gpo9y9m,"Good, if people didn't feel that way, It wouldn't have its current valuation and I wouldn't think there was an opportunity.

I try to find contrarian trades. CCL is one of those stocks that I am actually glad to hear people are positive about.

Good luck from the other side :)",14,0,1614878746,Beetin

11,gpodmuz,I agree. They burn through nearly a billion dollars every month. I dont understand why people think it's a good buy right now when the prospects of re-opening look farther and farther away. When is anyone going to realize they aren't making a penny for at least a year and they're HEMORRHAGING money.,3,0,1614880319,ZeroTolerrance

13,gpokj2q,"&gt;like their aging ships

Guess this guy missed the news recently announcing they are retiring something like 19 ships that were bleeding money.

As for the cash reserves and how much they are going through, the rate and percentage is comparable to the other majors (RCCL, NCL).  All three are more or less in the same position, with norwegian the weakest, and royal caribbean having dropped the least.  Carnival is in the best position to make a recovery.",1,0,1614883213,FlatBrokeEconomist
14,gpol059,"They have added about a billion in debt interest per year (ignoring maturity date pain), which is about 20% of their pre-covid **profits**. I mean their latest debts were unsecured, which is really telling of how junk their rating is.

They've done a great job in an impossible situation. Their assets value tanked and most couldn't be sold off, they couldn't pivot, and they couldn't shut down overhead costs without never being able to start up again.

They are going to limp along. Somehow 'not bankrupt for another two years' means 'should be worth more than  2019' to some investers.",3,0,1614883412,Beetin

17,gponxuy,Ya I guess they'll probably continuing to dump stock everytime there's a rally like they did 2 weeks ago. If the shareholders wanna cover the bill that's fine but that ain't me.,2,0,1614884644,ZeroTolerrance

23,gpp82g2,"I think built-up/pent-up demand might be overestimated and/or manipulated by cruise lines.

Right now they all have 0-hassle return policies. They send me a ton of promotional on-board casino cruises which I all book. I have like 13 of them next year - it's free to book. I'm NOT going to attend all of them, but I can always cancel with 0 risk. And they used to send me interior cabins for these promo offers, now they send me Junior Suites. I think if they are overbooked as they claim the are - it won't be a case.

P.S. I'm not high-value gambler for them. Nothing special.",1,0,1614893047,diamondpalantard

27,gppt1rf,The vaccination progress has frankly been a shit show. Thousands of vaccinations expiring in warehouses. Not to mention all the people refusing to get vaccinated or wear masks. I have a feeling it will take a lot longer than we think to get rid of this shit.,1,0,1614903006,ZeroTolerrance
