0,gqj46hp,"I think you’re talking about the executed sales real time ticker. Some red, some green and a few white sometimes in between.

I think the white means that they are individual orders executed at the same price to fill a large sell at the same price.

So if someone sells 1000 shares @ $200, a bunch of small 2, 5, 10 share orders up to 1000 will have to be filled at that price. So they all show up white until it’s filled.

Today after the drop I had never see. So many white orders for $203.50. I even during the halt I couldn’t scroll through them all!
