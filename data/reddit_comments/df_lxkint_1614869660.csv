71,gpnp9i4,"The end goal of short sellers and market makers (who give out options) is to not have the shares move up, or down, very fast.

If it goes down too much, it triggers the SSR rule. If it goes up very fast, suddenly they need to cover a whole bunch of options to which they don't have the shares for (which is part of what makes a gamma squeeze happen).

Unfortunately retail has limited volume power, so it will all come down to other big investors and other hedge funds to make this thing move the way we need it to.",15,0,1614869713,fortifier22
