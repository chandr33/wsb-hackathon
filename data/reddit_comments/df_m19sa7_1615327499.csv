2,gqdo8h7,"man this post is a great throwback at why it is wrong to blindly follow MM activity.

the pdf is about short volume, not NET short volume, which is what OP is about. When MM buys back immediately there is a accompanied long trade, which means the effective short-sale volume is 50%. The pdf you linked addressed this phenomenon showing how  this seemingly neutral volume action is actually long.

This ofc doesn‚Äôt mean OP‚Äôs data is right, 200% SI is way too high and I‚Äôll need to crunch the numbers myself, but this post is at least equally as bad

Also lets not pretend retail investors would not be buying that fucking dip caused everywhere else by this and bringing the markets back swinging. Also those short term capital gains taxes would be a nice lil part for the govt.

Also there are plenty of institutional players on the long side and this will only increase as more smell the blood in the water.

AFAIK, ""short sale"" does not equal ""sale"". A short sale means a share has been borrowed in order to be sold.

If short volume referred to just the act of selling, short volume should would always be equal to volume. Because each trade requires a seller and a buyer. So the number of sales each day always equals the number of trades (the volume).",2,0,1615328909,vegoonthrowaway

81,gqdrw6e,"If you‚Äôre asking me. Technically, I was hoping to find somewhere the ACTUAL short interest. A reliable metric and sell when it fell to some meager amount from the original 120%. I think that was everyone‚Äôs escape plan. However, I have two ways of looking at this:
1. Maybe shorts covered. In this case, the price fluctuation we are seeing is a result of speculation around the prospects of GME success. I think we are all expecting Cohen to create a new novel e-commerce industry. If this is the case the price is really reflective of pure speculation. Fundamentals are good as demonstrated by Deepfuckingvalues videos but hype is driving price rn and not book value. 

2. Short interest speculation: there are many here that think we have guns to short sellers and we can demand the price and this is a a different form of hype that I‚Äôm having trouble really verifying. 

These two things together are driving the price up: purely, speculation. What I feel (and I am by far no pro) is that the hype will set an average price not necessarily based on book value. And when GameStop makes more tangible business executions the price will go up because an average price has been set by speculation and reluctant sellers. The rise and fall of this speculative average will be based on earnings as GameStop becomes the new business it is trying to be.
