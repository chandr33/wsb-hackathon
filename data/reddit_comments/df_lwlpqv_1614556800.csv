70,gpigseb,"Applying what we know to the inverted delta hedge, we cannot currently assign a value to $GME for three (3) points without knowing the opening market value, future IV, and the theta.

However, a cursory evaluation of the previous value of $GME to point conversion at market close would yield an approximate value of the square root of Y squared over P - (A + B) square =/= r
(Given r = realized P&amp;L) 

If using unrealized gains (u), a different formula must be used where the absolute value of the greatest negative Integer would replace P (probablity).

Irrespective of method used, the result will be fractional and thus cannot be rounded. 

I highly recommend using #Robinhood for the ability to convert $GME/points into fractional shares.

$800 C con trak when stok iz $120 is (relatively) cheep. Stok move to $200, each share maek more (40% or 0.4x) gainz per Juan share.

Kompare apple to orange: apple (share) inkreez only by differenting bye price and kurrent value (above example shows $80 increase, or 40%, or 0.4x).
Orange (con trak) maek $0.76 per share, or 324%, or 3.24x).

If stok maek $200 per share, maybe $800 C iz now $5.34 per share, or $5 profit per share, or 1571%, or 15.71x.
