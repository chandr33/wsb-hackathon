0,gplc2ci,Also Palantir doesn’t put up with bs. Employees have a problem with something they have been shown the door real quick. No daycare mentality like you see at Google. I’m long 🚀,37,0,1614813741,techyvagabond

2,gpld3ia,"I'm super bullish on pltr, to the point where some people may think I'm a pltr shill or bot, nope, I just legit think they are going to be a 10 bagger in the coming years. Just seeing their project Gotham demo made me excited and terrified all in the same go and I thought about how amazing that software would have been had it been utilized during my time in the Corps, game changing... 

Anyways, I have a small position currently, most my funds are tied up in short term volatile plays but as soon as I dump those, it's all in on pltr. Then I'm smashing my phone and moving to the woods for a few years, then in 2024 I'll return to civilization and been stupid rich.",70,1,1614814253,r6raff

20,gpm66ip,"Future cash flows look promising. I love their contract structure and think their willingness to do the dirty work for the government/DOD will keep them the front runner in this sector. Would love to see them capture more market share, the IBM deal tells me they are on their way to doing just that. (IBM admitted defeat here, thats a BIG DEAL to me).",2,0,1614829571,lorde_dingus
