20,gqeznu0,"It's okay no point in looking back.

That's a pretty hefty loss but if and when you regain confidence to try again, I suggest paper trading for a little while so you can test your strategy to see if it works before yolo'ing your money into something without doing DD.

Learn to identify entrance and exit points and support and resistance and apply it to your fake paper trades. Test it out. And when you fail and take losing bets, reflect and ask yourself what you did wrong.",2,0,1615353454,petitehughie
