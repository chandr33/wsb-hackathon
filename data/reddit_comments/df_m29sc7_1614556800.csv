2,gqhz0yq,Airline &amp; cruise stock prices correlate with oil prices. As oil goes up so does airliners and cruises.,-1,0,1615413408,badnewsbearass

4,gqhzb82,"As far as teachers and kids being left behind, thats dumb talk.

Worst case scenario a kid repeats 2 years. My school will have an increase of 9.3% taking one or more classes again.

Because of that we anticipate an increase drop out rate of 2.3%

Thats not a generation being left behind. thats boomer gains bro

5,gqhzbvx,"Agree fully. Did great on aal late last year but won’t touch it at its valuation. Business travel is dead for some time, so planes are going to be less packed than cruises, theme parks, oil for summer drives etc.",1,0,1615413543,Hapifacep
6,gqhzwpu,"Cousin is a travel agent… Yes there’s still some people who use those. Just this last week alone airline bookings over the next six months are up 50%. You all do what you want. I’m going long on it.

8,gqi0m1h,It’s like oil refining. Refineries have to pay more for the oil but can sell the product at a higher cost thus making them more money. As the cost of fuel goes up airliners will need to charge more for seats thus making them more money,1,0,1615414118,badnewsbearass
9,gqi0ms7,"Ok, let’s do your math, 30 million dollar burn rate each day, but bookings are up 50%.  That’s still a huge mother fucking burn rate.  50% isn’t enough.  100% isn’t enough.  

200% and you have my attention.",1,0,1615414127,gkraigher
10,gqi0sph,Can airlines charge higher prices though?  Or aren’t all of them tripping over themselves to fill their planes with lower flights?,1,0,1615414202,gkraigher

12,gqi117k,I’m not a fan of AAL. I agree with you that they’re over priced. I think LUV &amp; UAL have the most upside. But with the country opening up people are going to want to travel. Whether it’s for vacation or to see family they haven’t seen in a long time,2,0,1615414312,badnewsbearass
13,gqi1ei8,Agreed there is pent up demand.  The question is how much,1,0,1615414487,gkraigher
14,gqi2bd7,That’s the million dollar question. That’s why I’m more bullish on oil stocks vs travel stocks. But no matter the price of fuel people are gonna have to buy,1,0,1615414919,badnewsbearass
15,gqi2k5m,That’s not how stocks work. They are worth their potential.  They are too big to fail and flying is getting kicked into overdrive the closer we get to vaccines.  Doesn’t matter what money they are burning. They d been burning it all quarantine at less profits and it’s only gone up.    Fighting airlines is like fighting the mouse.,2,0,1615415033,ice_nine459
16,gqi307l,"Things are just opening up. It’s ridiculous to think airlines would already be up 200% .

AAL is the preferred airline  of the film, TV and music business. Because they have three class cabins, United no longer does. They also go to more destinations than Delta.
 I like the stock!!!!!!!",1,0,1615415243,Jiggy1997

28,gqiptnr,"What is funny is I bought AAL back in late Jan for a swing play and set my exit around the $22.00 mark (a lot of boring details and knowing people in industry).  Managed to get out just shy of the peak today and have no intention of buying back in. Still bullish on a few others, but AAL has been making really bad decisions for years.

For those that are wanting to bet on travel, I've been saying it for months in this sub, go long SABR. They are the system/platform behind most bookings.",1,0,1615426996,Apex_Fail

35,gqj7537,"We already have that. It's more common then you think. So we have 10 vs the usual 3.

Most kids will either make up their credits, guess what you only need 24 to graduate and you can take 28 during high school. A full year is 7. So unless you fucked it away, and if you did you really didn't try because teachers bent over backwards this year. My staff is super stressed and burnt out, and done a great great job.

Legally we have to allow them to continue until 20, and they can turn 21 during the school year. It's bull, and we can usually avoid it, because most kids don't want to deal with being 20 in school and having classes with 14 year olds, but it does happen.

The legal age in the US to attend high school is 19-26, depending upon state. Montana is 19, Texas is 26! Yes, in Texas, you can have a 26 year old attending high school for free, with a 22 year old teacher. 

Mine is 21, you can start the year if you are 20 and turn 21, your can finish the year but you are done. No starting the school year if you are already 21.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my first years teaching I had the unfortunate experience of going to the bar with some co-workers in a neighboring town, and seeing 4 of my students legally drinking a beer and doing shots. Because they were 21. I was a 21 year old teaching 21 year olds. Yeah, that was great.",1,0,1615436661,InfiniteElway

39,gqjfkkw,"Amazon decided to change their business model entirely and went into servers and cloud computing.  They make money by scaling their warehouses and selling some goods, but Prime Video and selling goods aren’t their main source of revenue.  It’s cloud computing servers.

Those other companies don’t do that.

Tesla has a chance of making a battery that has huge applications for many other products.

But they won’t be the first or the only automated car company.  And their cars suck.  You can’t drive one from coast to coast right now.",1,0,1615441757,gkraigher
