13,gqaxv14,"One thing that I gained from WSB was  reconnecting with old friends from high school and the military. I posted my gains on Instagram and my inbox was flooded. Eventually I was able to socialize again and build relationships that I lost. Shout out to you guys, I was alone for the last 5 years and it got really depressing having no friends :(",1,0,1615273009,Zoey1234100
