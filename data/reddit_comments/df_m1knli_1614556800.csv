3,gqe5m6h,"That's a great question. It's an important question. Thanks for asking it. As I said in my opening statement, I appreciate you inviting me here to talk about this today. It's something that hasn't been discussed enough in my opinion. In conclusion, we're out of time.

7,gqe634c,Yes but it takes a few days and RH will disable your account while it processes.,3,0,1615336502,sparkstack
8,gqe63ww,Yes robinhood has an account transfer but it locks your account till the transfer is complete which can take a week. So if you are already on RobinHood stay put.,14,0,1615336514,AWildDragon

11,gqe6mw8,"Yep, it’s called an ACATS transfer or TOA.  Robinhood will charge you $75 to leave them, and take at least a week to get your transfer completed, during which you won’t be able to trade on your RH account.  You’ll need to have margin, and possibly options enabled at your new brokerage, or it will delay/cancel the transfer.",3,0,1615336792,Reddit_Fap_Account

31,gqeg6f1,"CashApp only allows trading on certain stocks, but currently both GME  and AMC are on the list. Their interface has a delay, so the price on RH is a few seconds ahead of CA. (I have $1 in RH, I just use it for the pretty lists. I use Fidelity for actual trading, and a little bit on CA.) They only allow purchases in dollar amounts, not shares, so you wind up with weird fractionals.

35,gqehfjh,"I initiated my move out of RH to Fidelity on Feb.12. It FINALLY finished up with my cash transfer at 4 this morning. The account was frozen this whole time, and there was no explanation how long it would take to get my cash out. (Stocks transferred late Feb, fractional shares sold Mar 1.)

I sent a ""Please help"" email. 4 days later, I get a SURVEY, ""How well did we resolve your issue?""  You didn't even ADDRESS my issue! Answered survey with 0 s and 1s. Got a reply 2 hours later, but still no word on the cash holdup. 

One special tidbit, though; once an account is suspended, it's dead, but you're free to make new accounts, as long as you use a new Email address. Wonder how many times you can do that, with a free share of something for each, if you only ever have one open at a time?",4,0,1615342561,Jef_Wheaton
