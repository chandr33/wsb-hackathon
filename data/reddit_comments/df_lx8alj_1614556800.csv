6,gpllaom,"Bought 2000 shares@.40 back when it was only gettin clout on /r penny stocks but I sold at 3 bucks and never looked back, do I believe in the vaccine? Yes their product is good and they’ll definently make money, but I have no faith in biopharma long term due to them needing a constant new thing to secure gains. I wouldn’t jump back in now, too risky, hence why this ape is all in on gme",2,0,1614818668,Adventurous-Walrus-7

20,gplrbdd,"I don’t really know much about stonks and I’m new to this sub, but I do know something about “biopharma” and “biotechnology.” Both of those are buzzwords that could be applied to any company that works in the biology sector. Also, a quick peek at the company’s webpage tells me they have a vaccine for the disease COVID-19 and not a cure. The difference being that there are several companies developing vaccines right now (vaccines are not that profitable btw) but no one has a cure for the long term effects some patients have suffered from being infected by SARSCoV-2 (the virus). So I don’t know if the company you’re promoting is going to be a hit or not, but the buzzwords aren’t helpful in making a decision.",7,0,1614822040,MaximumInformation

25,gplue5e,"Ya, that’s where my heads at. OP uses “Cure”. Last I checked, you can’t “cure” a virus. By definition, it is a mutation that is in constant state of mutation.  I think he meant treat, or vaccinate. But I was too put off by the constant use of “cure”.

29,gplx7ao,"Fun fact: I was going to do a tongue-in-cheek DD that would theoretically correlate the rise in popularity of this sub with rocketing crayon securities. So, I started by digging into Crayola, only to find out they're owned by Hallmark ™, and that's not publicly traded. And with that, my sarcastic DD on the possible explosion of the crayon market closed with a whimper. There may still be an angle on it, that I've yet to uncover tho.",1,0,1614824984,SaintAkira
