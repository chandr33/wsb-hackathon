4,gpliz5m,"I've taken to sorting posts by 'new' to find DD on other stocks. I feel like the hype will eventually die down. I've been lurking for awhile but I think the only way to see the GME talk slow down is just give it time. I'm looking forward to more variety of DD. I've made plays in the last couple weeks that have been lucrative based on posts here, but they do get lost in the shuffle.",87,0,1614817288,basketcase57
5,gplizju,"100% agree. We were talking about this in the discord I'm in today. So many useless posts that just have GME and AMC in the title without anything, not even a funny image. There was plenty of shitposting before, but at least there was substance with some level of effort put into it.

:edit: I haven't even really been on in a while, but grabbed some PLTR positions today and wanted to see if there was any WSB hype behind it. Had to sort through a bunch of bullshit before I saw anything about PLTR.",23,0,1614817294,holeeray
