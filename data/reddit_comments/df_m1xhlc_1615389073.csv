84,gqgavky,"Last month or w/e, when it dropped from $400 to $100, I thought I was done. I had invested my life savings, even borrowed and invested that money into it, all at around $250. I was blood-fucked, vomiting from anxiety because I had to pay my landlord. I was going to be put out on the street as I currently am out of work. My family and friends thought I was an idiot, laughed in my face at my stupid money choices.

The only bright side was that my landlord had lost a little money too on GME (and AMC) and he said I had two months to recoup the payments. 

Well, I didn't know what to do. How could I make the thousands I owed money back in 2 months? I have no job.

Then this happened. I could sell right now, pay off my debts, ensure no more panic attacks, even make a couple hundred bucks in profit. I could regain my dignity among family and friends. 

But I didn't invest my life savings to effectively break even. I didn't go all in and suffer the debilitating anxiety attacks, endure embarassment and shame of my community, and contemplate ending it all JUST for a couple hundred bucks.

No boys, I am all the way in until we hit the ends of the cosmos! HOLDING FOREVER!
