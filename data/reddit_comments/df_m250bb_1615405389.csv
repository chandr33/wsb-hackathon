1,gqhggxk,CNBC has become enemy number one for me. Everything I do is against what they recommend and it's working. They clearly wants us to see us fail. When Roblox open at a 40 Billion valuation. It's fair to say that GME becoming an ecommerce platform is worth 10x that amount. If GME stalls I don't care. I will hold just like I have been doing all this time. Selling at a loss is for paper hands and I am none of that.,1,0,1615405406,MrRios87
2,gqhghom,"Like, all three people I live with: all bought 10 @ $325.24 and ALL sold between $50-$55. Now I'm debating whether or not to compensate them with a small portion of my eventual profits.

12,gqhh0jt,"Which doesn't take long in a huge fast-paced newsroom. Plus CNBC had 4 people working on this particular story. Plus it's just a report of what happened, so it's a very cut and dry approval/editing process.

Like I said, the news is very much against us, but this just isn't hard proof of it. This is just how fast journalists work. When you write thousands of stories per year on your specific beat, you get really fast",3,0,1615405640,-Lloyd-Braun-

The dissenting view I would have would be that why weren't they writing about the strong increase in price from opening to before it crashed.
