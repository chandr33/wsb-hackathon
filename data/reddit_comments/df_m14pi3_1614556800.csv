17,gqbm52u,ha ha... oh please stop with the drama. Stocks go up and stocks go down. In a few months everyone will be on here complaining that they should have bought when it was 10 dollars a share.

44,gqc9i0t,"It must be fun to be so naive.  Small companies almost never bring drugs to the market.  They are sold or licensed to the big boys before they get there.  If I'm Pfizer or Moderna do I push to get the cure I bought to the market where I might make a few thousand on a couple of vials, or do I bury it and continue to sell my treatments that last for months or years and net me big bucks?  The money has always been in the treatment, not the cure.",0,0,1615305585,chiefoogabooga
45,gqcb3y3,"This line of thinking is so moronic it borders on anti-vax. Does BB allow itself to get hacked regularly to prove its existence is valid? There is a lot of shit and misinformation in big pharma, but mostly related to treatments being over lobbied and not effective, not because Pfizer sits on the cure but won't publish it. And how tf is it more profitable to let 99% of your clients die within 5 years instead of curing them to sell them the same treatment 10 years later (lung cancer)? As for vaccines, they are easiest to make, you rly think if Pfiser had a cure (which everyone is trying to find/make for over a year), he would not sell it to cut into its 5$ a vial vaccine penny profits?",0,0,1615306197,prosysus

50,gqcgc1h,"Everyone believes what they want to believe.  Just reflect for a second on pharma and medical and what is connected to it.  Start at the top.

Politicians - It's hard to keep people freaked out and bickering over their access to health insurance if the cure for everything (and not saying we're there, yet) is a credit card swipe and a few pills away.  Healthcare is a campaign platform all by itself.

Government - specifically the FDA. Who controls the government agency that every drug has to go through to get approval?  Oh yeah, politicians.

Insurance - We don't like paying hospitals, but we make a profit on premiums.  If there was a cure for everything people would stop buying insurance and we'd go bankrupt.

Big medicine/hospitals - Wouldn't it be great if there was a cure for everything?  Well, no.  Our hospitals would be empty and we'd go bankrupt.

Big Pharma - We make a fortune selling drugs that people are on for a lifetime to treat illnesses.  We can't sell an individual round of whatever the cure is for anywhere close to that amount.

Small Pharma - We found a cure, but it costs so much to get through the trials that we have to sell it to big Pharma.  We don't have the money or the connections to get past the FDA.  I hope Big Pharma does the right thing here...

And what do Insurance, Big Medicine, and Big Pharma all have?  Lobbyists.  Which completes the circle back to the Politicians.  But I'm sure that little company that has the cure can buck the trend against all of these forces and make lots of money...",1,0,1615308109,chiefoogabooga
