2,gqh1x9u,exactly what I was trying to do at 205 and my order wouldn't go through and it went through at 265 and dropped another 20.... so i'm bad at this clearly....,1,0,1615399530,Missy1726
3,gqh1x9p,"It seems like Hedgies dumped about 1.5 million shares (I saw this number in a comment somewhere idk how much actually) to drop the stock price, which likely triggered a bunch of stop limits at like 300 that autosold. The NYSE froze the stock in what is called a circuit breaker stop, because it was being unrealistically volatile. Since bottoming out, it is now steadily rising again. Amc and gme both dropping that aggressively at the same time seems very much like manipulation to me.

Edit: I smell my own farts and eat crayons. This was not financial advice. I am a retard.",3,0,1615399530,EggAtix
