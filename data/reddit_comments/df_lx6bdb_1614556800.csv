33,gplaku4,"I'm literally actually all for teaching others what I know. I'm still a retard myself, so don't take this as financial advice. But, here's my position breakdown:

$SPY is an ETF on the S&amp;P 500. It's cheaper to play than the actual S&amp;P, in addition to the fact that it's the most common way to buy options on the overall index of the market. So I'm betting that the price will aggressively go from $380 right now towards $250 by June 18th. There are tens of thousands of others that are making similar bets. For me to make money, I don't necessarily need the price to actually fall that far. Any type of aggressive drop in price will raise the premiums of those option contracts, and more premium = more money for me because I bought in early while the price was going in the opposite direction. Today was the first big indicator that I'm right. There will be many more like it if I am.",4,0,1614813001,thinkclay

This dude is really great at breaking things down and is soothing. Make the time investment to actually learn the greeks. They're important. Options can wreck even the most skilled traders, so do your own research and master the basics. It's only a couple of hours time invested to learn the basics. And it's best to only invest what you can 100% afford to lose without getting emotional about it. Until that point, paper trade to test your skills. I did this exact approach for almost a year before investing any serious cash.",3,0,1614814554,thinkclay
