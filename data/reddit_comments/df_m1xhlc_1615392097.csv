16,gqghzhn,"Agreed. Plus (as I understand it) for it to get to $100k that means it's almost 100% MM's/hedgies buying to cover at that point...and yeah, they all vastly underestimated our devotion to this stock but they're not 100% stupid, they'll cover what they already haven't well before that price. Plus they have all the tools at their disposal which we've already seen implemented. Does anyone really think retail investors are buying at any consistent rate once this hits $500-$800? Hell no, like you said there will be lots of gain-taking, and rightly so. And does anyone really believe shit brokers like RH are going to pay out $100k per share to their customers??? That's laughable.
