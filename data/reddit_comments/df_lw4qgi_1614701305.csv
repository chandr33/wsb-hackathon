**GAMESTOP**",12,0,1614701325,LongLength0
37,gpfe28e,"# Things we should keep in mind today:

&amp;#x200B;

* There is no way to predict when the squeeze will happen
   * There will be crazy price action in both directions
   * This can go on as long as the shorts remain solvent
   * The longer they drag this out, the higher it goes
   * People might say, ""Lift-Off in 10!"" But they're just excited
   * Nobody knows when it'll happen or how high it will go

Basically, don't believe the hype, but feel free to join in. You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

In other words, **fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.**

* There is no ""we.""
   * I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME
   * I will not buy because someone else says to do so
   * I will not encourage others to buy
   * Nothing I say is financial advice
   * If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.

Report posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.

* There will be plenty of FUD (or ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt"")
   * I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite
   * There are redditors being paid to scare you
   * There are bots made to SPAM negativity
   * There are people profiting when you sell
   * This starts ramping up in the afternoon

There are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who *will* come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just ""*sElL iT's OvEr.*""

* This is the motherfucking **GME Megathread**
   * Do not push other tickers
   * Do not jingle keys in our faces
   * Fuck you

I, personally, go out of my way to CTRL/CMD+F and search for other tickers. If you're bringing up non-GME stocks in order to distract the thread, I'm one of the downvotes on your comment. Sue me.

* We can fucking do this
   * We have them where we want them
   * We can name our price
   * As long as we hold, we have what they want
   * They will pay out the ass to get it

They'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.

* If you're new, this may not be for you
   * This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for
   * You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses
   * Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD
   * Read the DD
   * Read the DD
      * DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.

And now, obligatory emojis:

# 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑💎👐💎👐🦍🦍🦍🦍📈📈📈📈

&gt;TLDR; If you need a TLDR, then you shouldn't be in the short squeeze. You're taking a serious risk by skipping the research required to make smart decisions, and I highly discourage you from doing so. Read the DD, read like your fucking life depends on it.

72,gpfe3cs,"Why I am no longer stressed about GME:

I believe it will moon. When it does, I will know. I will get the best price from the hedgies. I don’t know when. It could be today or this week or this month or more. When it happens, I’ll watch, I’ll wait, I’ll HODL till they are bled out, I’ll take my tendies and do beautiful things in my life/community.

Until then, I don’t care if it drops. No stress. If it goes below 100, I’ll average down more. Great opportunity. Nothing to fear.

If there is no squeeze, well, I beleive DFV that there is deep f****ing value for GameStop. My average is $155 @ 31 shares. Worst care scenario: I wait until GameStop surpasses my average in the long run. That’s okay.

TLDR:

GME moons some day, I win.
GME drops: I average down: I win.
GME doesn’t moon but grows into a gaming powerhouse company: I HODL longer but I eventually win.

We win.
