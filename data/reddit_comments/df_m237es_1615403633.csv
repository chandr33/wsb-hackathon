26,gqhc991,"How to make money with a hedge fund:

--Own algorithms that can react to the market and trade shares at speeds thousands of times faster than a human can perceive.

--Ride the memiest meme stock up to an insane valuation as cultish hype draws in a tidal wave of brand new retail investors.

--At the tippy-top, sell a fuckton of shorts (this will be important later)

--Tank the stock by selling huge numbers of shares and triggering the algorithms at other hedge funds to do so as well.

--Wait for the bottom, which your algorithm will perceive and react to faster and better than any human, then buy back in

--Ride to the top again as millions of retail investors dip into their life savings, student loans, and mortgages to ""buy the dip.""

--""Will it keep climbing?"" the retail investors will ask. ""What's the short interest?"" And guess what? The SI is still high! Remember those shorts we sold at the top? Hold on to them as long as you want to create incentive for apes to keep buying in! If the price comes anywhere near the price you short-sold at, go ahead and buy them back! It's still a profit, after all!

--Rinse and repeat as needed! Siphon away the money of idealistic market amateurs who think they're ""drinking hedgie tears"" but are actually pouring money into a losing battle of day trades.",-9,0,1615403640,idea-man
