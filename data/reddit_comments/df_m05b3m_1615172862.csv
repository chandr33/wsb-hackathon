[$XLE](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/XLE) Oil is traded only in US Dollars globally. When the dollar is weak, oil prices rise. The amount of stimulus injected into the economy due to Covid dwarfs any past stimulus measures taken in the history of the planet.    This devalues the dollar (its inflationary). Oil must rise simply due to the dollar inflation created by the stimulus.    Couple the dollar inflation with rising demand due to vaccines (and travel demand returning) and the constrained supply, you have the next bull market in oil for the next decade.    Play this with [$ERX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ERX). It‚Äôs double levered to XLE. Meaning if XLE moves 5%, ERX moves 10%.

Even if they komikazied those drones into the refineries, we're talking 22 individual chances for damage. And lets not forget, they also attacked some Military positions. So that really doesn't leave a lot of ammunition left to actually cripple Oil production.



According to [this article](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:axPmeIZqBPwJ:https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/saudi-houthi-attack-ras-tanura-aramco/2021/03/07/77f29148-7f72-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) the attack on the refinery only damaged one Oil tank. If the houthi's had crippled oil production for months, you'd best believe they'd be shouting it from the rooftops.

If QQQ and TQQQ are both $100 per share, and Q moves down 5% in one day that brings it to $95 per share, where TQ's move will be 15% down to $85. If the next day Q regains 5%, that's a gain of $4.75 which puts the value up to $99.75 per share, or a 0.25% loss from the start.
TQ will move 15% with Q's 5, and 15% of 85 is 12.75, putting TQ's value at $97.75. That's a 2.25% loss compared to a 0.25% loss across a volatile 2 day period, because of leverage. Now in this example if you had day traded TQQQ you would have made greater returns, or if the stonk is going up steadily without significant correction downwards, that will also allow for greater returns.
