14,gq9pmlh,Its because they have hidden their shorting through shorting indexes with GME and lying about their numbers,4,0,1615246295,epicoliver3
15,gq9qd3w,I view options as a way to leverage delta to price. I can get access to twice the amount of shares by buying deep ITM calls than if I were buying shares. The cost is a relatively small premium,1,0,1615246687,I_sell_FDs
16,gq9qsiv,"I believe this. I think They are shorting etfs that contain gme, covering all but gme, and keeping it shorted without it being directly on the stock. This gme price is about to be really volatile.",3,0,1615246911,skqwege

19,gqa51mv,"I always buy out of the money calls (as in, stock price is 100, I buy calls for 400) for a week or two out when I think something is going to be super volatile.  As soon as something becomes really volatile the options start shooting up in value.  Last last monday I sold a call that I bought for $12 for RKT on the friday before for $4k.  I jumped out too soon though because if I had waited until later in the day it was going for $20k.  Made me wish I had bought $1200 instead of $12 and waited until they were $20k instead of 4. :-D (for math challenged apes that would have been turning $1200 into $2mil in 3 days.",2,0,1615254627,realaccountforsure

23,gqai1vx,"Yes, their calculations seem to be off.  Good eye.  The 3.91M shares were covered but they were multiplied by the Friday closing price of $137.74 instead of Monday's (today) closing price of $194.50 worth $761MM.  

There are still 13.83M share short so you multiply that by the $56.76 and you get about $785MM in losses to all those people who remained short.  

I don't know the details behind there data but I think the overall decline in the short interest is the bigger story making me think it was the option chain (gamma squeeze) driving most of the action.  Plus you have to realize that man people are buying shares and holding so I would imagine that the float is even less than we think.",1,0,1615261851,AGeeeeezy
24,gqakwe2,"Yes, I agree there are other ways to short GME.  That is why I think it's important to know the numbers for the traditional way and then you make the appropriate adjustments for the ETFs.",1,0,1615263560,AGeeeeezy

33,gqdckvw,"This is fantastic. Low risk gamble and huge reward. Sure you missed bigger profits but you earned what most people make in a month in a day.

The question is can you reproduce how you find these potentially volatile stocks?",1,0,1615322367,milezy
34,gqddzmc,"I chase a lot lol.  So, I found RKT by looking at the DD's here.  I only bought $12 worth of calls because that is all I had available to trade with right that second because I was in the middle of moving money around.  If I had more available I would have done 10x as much and pocketed at least 40k.  Probably would have sold half for 20k and waited longer for it to go up.

Anyway, I look at the DD flair posts in here every day before market close to see if anything looks like it might legit be super volatile the next day, then buy options for it.",1,0,1615322998,realaccountforsure
