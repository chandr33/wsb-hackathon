37,gpifvyt,"Wow, do I read this right? You forecast them to be profitable in 2023 and that they'll up their revenue 80 times until 2030?

Certainly possible, but seems rich on first glance. 2019 to 2020 they increased revenue by 50% , but also doubled their expense for double the loss. Your projection forecasts an immediate improvement for 2021 in that regard. I guess this follows the guidance, but I'm skeptical to project it out like that for 30 years.

Anyways I do own a small position, but I think PLTR's valuation is kind of rich at the moment. Definitely huge potential, but not cheap.",3,0,1614756956,L3artes

48,gpisvex,"Thanks and yes, that is what I'm doing. I find it very unrealistic that revenue and cost will diverge as drastically as they do in your model. 

Basically I'm looking at the your net margin. You project a net margin of 67% for 2030. This is ridiculous. No company this size has such a margin.

Also their business is AI/data-science solutions that are tailored for their customers. They cannot just sell the same software more often. They need to scale on their end as well if they grow revenue.

The point is that they are pushing stock comp into expenses. It's ok if it's a minimal event going public etc. etc. but if it's going to happen over and over year over year, not good. Based on guidance and growth of 30% YoY they'll likely get it under control.",1,0,1614781101,Farmer_eh

68,gpk3mgi,"No problem, and sure. I’ve got COGS increasing at the same % rate as revenue until 2025 before increasing at a slightly lower rate as I anticipate efficiency gains and perhaps a small tapering of some aspects of R&amp;D. 

At the moment the contracts in involve a lot of boots on the ground, but that’s actually in the process of being changed through the development of their Apollo software, which will use AI to begin to automate the setup process. Because of the nature of their business acquisition process, I believe that marketing/sales costs have the ability to decrease over time also. This is because they categorise their business in three ‘tiers’ if I remember correctly, which involves selling new customers smaller, less comprehensive contracts and allowing the software/quality of the product to do some of the heavy lifting in terms of selling new contracts for them. As more ‘entry level’ customers are onboarded they will have more room for revenue growth that will require less expense.
