39,gqg414q,Who the fuck is worried about a DIP?,1,0,1615385871,uselessvariable
40,gqg4153,"Not sure if they borrowed 500k shares from the 850k yesterday or 350k is just the number of shares that can be borrowed today but just be aware of this when/if it dips hard at open. Use these publicly available resources to better your decisions and also to calm your mind if you think the dips are from people selling because most likely they are not. You can also use the Stonk-O-Tracker to see exactly when these shares were borrowed so you can compare that time to the dips on the graphs and I'll bet that most of the big dips will coincide with these borrowed shares. This is your money at stake so be sure to use every publicly available resource to your advantage because I'm sure the HFs are using them to theirs.
