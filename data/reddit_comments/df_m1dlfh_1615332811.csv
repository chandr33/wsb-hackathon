What's happening is the potential transfer of huge amounts of that money from hedge funds, who do fuck all to fix the world's problems, to a large number of other parties which may well include people that *could* help fix the world's problems.

The issue here is if you look at the total energy input into the panels.

Which if you really think about it.  You will say.. well that's pretty stupid.  In fact we'd actually be better off right now without making all those panels.
