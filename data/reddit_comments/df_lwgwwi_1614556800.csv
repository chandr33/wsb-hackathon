2,gphapso,I would expect the crash to be a bit later. However things are changing. I wonder how this will workout as the US is actively in (trade) cold war with China. I would expect that key crash to be avoided at all costs. Remindme! 1 week,2,0,1614732191,Dramatic_Importance4

5,gphb5c4,"the qe into assets thing is probably non tech companies just holding onto money waiting for the  covid thing to go by, getting more assets isn't really something to stress over. now the bond and treasury part is worrisome in that it would mean they dont trust the market but that dosnt mean it's gonna blow up anytime soon. anyone with a brain can tell we're inflated but so what? dosn't tell us when its gonna pop... most importantly, where is the proof? where are the sources?

27,gpi4d37,I just watched him and he's awesome. Powerful message. Not an pessimist.,2,0,1614748180,Jumpy-Ad9268
28,gpi5703,"Check it - Ok first - he starts cooking with gas end of middle to end of interview. So, go get your popcorn - do your texting early. The background is a bit of a snooze if you don't love, love, love economics (which he claims he does not follow) but he peps it up. This is a guy who admits to using the Masters and Johnson sex manual graph as an example of the life of a bubble. He talks about central bankers who never ran a business or had sex. It's pretty empowering. His quantitative and qualitative messages. BEST OF ALL - he is not peddling a book, methodology, movement, financial instrument, nor does he dis anyone by name or even title. He talks fast and makes sense. Also says we have to ride this out it will be the biggest shit storm ever but if it runs it's natural course rather than being propped up, leveraged or whatever - it will be up to the Millennials to pull us out of it. I may have sold him short here (no pun intended) so let him speak for himself. PS - He thinks the GME phenomenon is FANTASTIC. As in good - not as in fantasy.  

OH - watch the interview with Daniella something of Stansberry Research early Feb  2021. I'm thinking if I attach a link, it'll get removed and I will be  vaporized.",3,0,1614748730,Jumpy-Ad9268

Don't know what interview you saw though. The thing is it is all PRETEND. They are calling it ""sentiment."" So, if the market makers say there's going to be a crash, and many are - I think they are market makers - or PR for them - then that's likely to happen.

35,gpidk1g,"Perhaps we need to define ""crash."" Is it the end of the world, or the end of the world, as we know it?  For some MM who thought their power invincible, the meme stock ""debacle"" ""crashed"" the market.  The brokerages said their systems crashed. Hey, if you show up to a party you weren't on the guest list for, it's called crashing. Perhaps reconfiguring and power shifts are forms of crashing. Revolution is a crash. I heard him say something about revolution. But I've seen one interview. Never heard of him before. So I am completely qualified to weigh in, right?",1,0,1614754968,Jumpy-Ad9268
