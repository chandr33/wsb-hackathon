10,gqh609f,"My dearest Emma,

Though I promised you that I should try to keep from doing anything to make you feel bad, yet I have volunteered my services to my country as a retard in the ranks of the North Carolina Volunteer Mobile Phone Militia. So many of my friends are going and the cause is so just, that I cannot resist going with them and for the cause‚Ä¶.In my company are four or five shit posters, as many diamond hands, several paper hands, a goodly number of unemployed, and one mister‚Ä¶besides four degenerates and other non respectable persons ad infinitum. ¬†Emma, I shall not affect to believe that you do not feel bad to have your mister go away, for I know you do. I feel bad myself. But somebody must go; and who can go better than young retards like myself, without business and with family to demand my attention. The heart which prompted the words, ‚ÄúGo, if you think it your tendies,‚Äù has increased claims to my confidence and my love. I have thought of those words a ¬†thousand times since you spoke them.

With love for your mister,
