5,gqanqh3,"buy him some simple dividend producing stocks and etf's with a good portion of the money.  Use the rest for options or riskier plays to juice return.  Or you could just use the dividends to buy options to try and get a home run type payoff.  SOme boring dividend paying stocks to look at O, MAIN, T, MO,  Kimberly Clark,NOBL .  If you get him into a good group of etf's that spit off monthly dividends that money will help add to what he has and also give him a window on what type of income he would be looking at from the portfolio.",1,0,1615265346,hbsquatch

18,gqar8cl,"20 years ago my parents got cleaned out along with about 500 other people of the guy that made the worst trades in the history of the world and a short that leveraged them so hard they had to remortgage the house, entire savings cleaned.  I didn't know at the time, came back from school and was looking and was like you didn't see any red flags when you were down 100k this one month... trusted the guy too much, helped them and ran golf tournaments and shit for the group ... I don't know how he wasn't murdered by someone from there.",1,0,1615267739,Dj-BLR
