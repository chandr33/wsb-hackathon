1,gqhb9k5,So how can I place a buy order for 1 stock? But not for 2? When I have more than enough funds to buy 3?,1,0,1615403229,TimsKillerRabbit

4,gqhbdrn,You gotta cancel the order thats pending. If that doesnt work and you dont have yiur shares yet its likely filled and didnt show up yet.,2,0,1615403278,Analoghogdog

7,gqhbe97,"Seems like those that bought in last time in January at the $340 mark, bailed out once they broke even and didnâ€™t want to risk losing again.",1,0,1615403284,ncmor
8,gqhbmtw,"The other buy order was probably still processing the cancel, and also the stock only stayed at 190 for a cpl of mins while halted then jumped back up.

Obviously i cant give you a full run down as i cant see your account but ive never had an issue with 212.

Edit - sorry totally misread the top bit, it sounds nore like your first order got sorted then trading halted again as it shot up so unless you simply forgot to put a limit and put market fill then im not sure",1,0,1615403384,R4TTIUS
9,gqhbsqm,"You've misunderstood. I had buy limits which triggered so got those shares.

It's now gone back up to $260ish right?

In my account I have Â£500 sat there so I now want to place more buy limit orders at $190 (I can afford 3 stocks at that price).

However, I am only able to place a buy limit order of 1 at $190. 

If I try to place 2 (so costs $380) the app says I don't have enough funds - BUT I DO!",2,0,1615403452,TimsKillerRabbit
10,gqhc0nn,Trading 212 has been manipulating stocks and pennystocks for awhile. They can set stocks to only sell if something is too hyped. They are cooperating with hedge funds so they can short each stock when set to sell only. This kind of method they can earn money back when made lost and there is nothing what you can do. I have been trading many hyped otc stocks and when they get too they set to sell only.,1,0,1615403543,Gol-D_R0ger
