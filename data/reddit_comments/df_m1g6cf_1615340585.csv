31,gqedtff,"It is fascinating to watch (and I have calls). But it‚Äôs such a stupidly simple principle. *Just don‚Äôt sell* Everytime a block of shares get shorted, a certain percentage of those get ‚Äúlocked away‚Äù not to be available again - other than their trickery. 

I keep thinking that since shares are traded for 16hrs a day all the big boys can think is that this is RELENTLESS. There‚Äôs not enough liquidity for them to pull their pro moves from 6-8pm or from 4-7am, so by the time they have a chance to start doing their thing for the day, they‚Äôre already $20-$30 behind. It‚Äôs amazing to watch.",2,0,1615340614,tech405
