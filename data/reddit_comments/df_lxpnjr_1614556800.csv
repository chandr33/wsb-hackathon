This would greatly cut into your time as a driver since other orders could be ready to pickup by the time you get to the restaurant.

DoorDash used to only pay around $0.30 more for orders you had to order yourself. It was a total waste of time so I declined every one that was given to me. If you did accept it, and the customer ordered something the restaurant was out of, you then had to contact customer support. Support would then call the customer and try to see if they want a replaced or part of their order canceled. This would sometimes take another 15 minutes since people don't answer their phone.

They also reported that they expect a decrease of orders and average cost of order for 2021. This will mean they expect less revenue in 2021 than in 2020. So they are admitting that they will have even less revenue in 2021 than in 2020. This is very disappointing since focusing on growth was their #1 excuse for never making a profit in the first place.
