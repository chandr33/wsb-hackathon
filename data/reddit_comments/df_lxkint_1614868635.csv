39,gpnn1rd,"Don't get caught up in the minute-to-minute movements. There is super-low volume and it might be another flat day.

Set your buy order where you're comfortable ($120.00 seems to be the consolidation price) and hold for the potential spike. Maybe it will happen today. Maybe Monday. Maybe next Friday. Just keep your shares locked up, average down if possible. 

Eventually, there's going to be a big fish causing this to swing one way or the other. Right now everyone is keeping their powder reasonably dry.
