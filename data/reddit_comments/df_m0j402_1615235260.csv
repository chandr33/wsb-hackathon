IMPORTANT you do not have to exercise the call to make money. Just sell the contract when you are in the money instead of exercising the option to buy.

I'm in the industry, for a long time now.  There is no world where I could consider working for them based on what I read.  None.  

My curiosity got piqued seeing mortgage companies on here,  so I dug in a bit.  

Long story short,  this can be a highly volatile industry.  Last year was wildly profitable.  It can not and will not last.

If the Fed is unable to hold rates down,  especially mortgage rates,  the pent up purchase market will shrink, and refinances will drop drastically.

There will be a huge rush,  then volume will drop off a fucking cliff.  I'm talking 50-80%. They'll eat a few months before they cut staffing. Net income will plummet. 

They will likely do very well for the next 6- 9 months regardless of interest rates.  But if rates do rise to 4.5-5%, 50% or more of revenue will vanish within 4-6 months of hitting that rate.
