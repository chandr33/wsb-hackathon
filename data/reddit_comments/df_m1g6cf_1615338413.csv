I think it‚Äôs entirely possible Disney releases childrens‚Äô movies exclusively on D+ and ‚Äúadult‚Äù movies (no not that kind, I mean like Marvel) in theaters. Reason being that adults can enjoy the high quality and will want to experience it in the best form possible. D+ kids‚Äô movies could be amazing. No more bathroom breaks or crying or spilled concessions during Frozen 4; just throw it on in the living room and WFH
