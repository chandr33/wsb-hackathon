(Edited:) So what are you telling us? Since I can't read the spreadsheet, what info is it giving that means something to us? And if it's technical, what does it mean to those of us who may not know how to read the technical analysis?",25,0,1614892800,LilMissMostlyRight

9,gpp9t8y,"think of a venn diagram. There are some differences in each that effect price, but at least 20 variables centered that effect both. When they move in tandem, it's ETF manipulation, likely pertaining to shorts. Whether it's further shorting/laddering of those ETFs or covering. Hypothetically speaking, if GME squeezes and those ETFs cover, AMC will see a drastic rise and may squeeze as well-- and vice versa of course. Speculative.",5,0,1614893810,Repulsive_Impact_651

11,gppa3kp,"Following up on your edit. It's data. Another resource for our more developed apes to interprate. 

For me? If GME OR AMC squeezes, covering shorts in those 20 ETFs will likely send the latent symbol into a squeeze as well. It means another win condition for either side. Speculative opinion, of course.",7,0,1614893936,Repulsive_Impact_651

This is for those of you who trade options, though, correct? I'm not smart enough to do that yet. I'm still just a young monkey trying to learn from all of you big strong apes!",2,0,1614894108,LilMissMostlyRight

14,gppc4hw,The producers screwed up the movie for sure but that has nothing to do with my post. AMC is divergent as you pointed out thus different path than GME. It’s a joke That’s all sorry I hurt your brain next time only use blocks,3,0,1614894827,Above-Majestic1776

16,gppcli2,"This is clearly not the reason they were correlated in January and early February. Neither was it the reason they were correlated in the last couple weeks: other small retailers didn't follow the same pattern. It also doesn't explain why the correlation appeared to come to an end today. In fact, it appeared that AMC was following the market while GME was magnetically attracted to numbers ending in 5 (where there is high open interest in 3/5 and 3/19 calls.)",6,0,1614895037,Oxianas

&amp;#x200B;

Shared ETFS? nah, that aint it. It's clearly GME having an affinity for the number 5.   
fuck, lmfao. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the volume pump of both at the same time of day, followed by the dip. You are wrong. Both have outside variables as well, but factually speaking, the data is there for the 20 shared ETFs. They're there. You can watch the numbers fluctuate and see the influence on price. You can actually do that.... or you can stick with your magic ""5"" theory.",5,0,1614900014,Repulsive_Impact_651
20,gppofv6,"The correlation has been too great to be fully explained by this. In particular, for weeks AMC and GME have been following eachother's large movements, which is not explained by ETFs.

The affinity for 5 is due to delta hedging and speculation on that delta hedging, not numerology, of course.",1,0,1614900654,Oxianas
