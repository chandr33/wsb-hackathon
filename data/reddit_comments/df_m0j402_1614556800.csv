Apes on the other hand and now taking those bets. Problem is there are really high profile stocks taking all the money apes have to offer. If GME takes off, and makes a bunch of millionaires, those apes will move on to the next thing. Maybe this stock. Maybe not. ASO is also really shorted, but not a lot of interest in that either.
