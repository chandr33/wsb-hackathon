The point is, all the garbage going around that is not us IS REAL and is being done by someone. There has to be a reason for that. The DD being deleted from WSB, the bogus articles in MSM. Even if I did not do my own DD (which I have) it is totally obvious what is going on. I stand with you brother APE strong. Do not be weak minded look around you!

My life was easy because my parents worked 2 jobs each. Don't get me wrong, I'm not rich but I and my siblings were able to go to college and grad school and were set up for good careers.

But I absolutely HATE knowing there are so many people without access to the same quality of life. The door is closed for so many!! All I did was be born. This is NOT right. At the very least the ladder should be accessible for people to climb, but in reality the ladder no longer exists.

I HATE knowing there are people struggling to pay rent. I HATE knowing there are people with less than ten bucks to their name. I HATE knowing there are parents who, despite everything they've tried, cannot afford to put food on the table for their children. 

I don't have anymore dumb money to blow. It's all already in GME. Even if it goes to 0 it's no sweat off my back. But if I hit it big my local food banks are gonna hit it big too. That's why I'm in.",100,2,1614876777,babatoger
