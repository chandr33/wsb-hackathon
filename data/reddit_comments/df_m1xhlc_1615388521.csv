8,gqg9lj0,"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;

Or close the wall up and surrender with our bros@$400 without tendies and our fallen Robinhood users.

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man

As modest stillness and humility:

But when the blast of war for $GME blows in our ears,

Then imitate the actions of [u/DFV](https://www.reddit.com/u/DFV/);

Stiffen the sinews, summon up the memes,

Disguise fair nature with hard-favored 💎🙌;

Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;

Let pry through the portage of $6942.00 and beyond

Like the brass cannon; let the brow overwhelm it

As fearfully as doth a drop in our $GME shares

Overhang and jutty his confounded base,

Swill'd with the wild and wasteful Wallstreet.

Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,

Hold hard the breath and bend up every share

To his full height. On, on, you noblest tendie seekers.

Whose blood is fet from fathers of retard-investments!

Fathers that, like so many Chamaths and Elons,

Have in these parts from morn till even fought

And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:

Dishonor not your mothers; now attest

That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.

Be copy now to men of grosser blood,

And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,

Whose limbs were made in WSB, show us here

The mettle of your pasture; let us swear

That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;

For there is none of you so mean and base,

That hath not noble luster in your eyes.

I see you stand taller than your wife's boyfriend in the slips,

Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:

Follow your spirit, and upon this charge

Cry 'God for DFV, WSB, and JUSTICE!' 💎🙌",11,0,1615388523,jsm2008
