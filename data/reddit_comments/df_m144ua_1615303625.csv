35,gqc4khb,"Here's my thinking.  That freeze that knocked out the refineries down south, jacked everything up.  The demand for diesel (and prices) is through the roof right now.  I haven't seen it this high in like, forever.  Problem is, those refineries down south are having trouble getting the diesel up where it needs to be; sending it through pipes takes at least two weeks to plan and ship.  Also, oil producers (at least here in Kansas), are sitting on their oil waiting for prices to go up.  I think oil could skyrocket soon, but that hurts refineries in the short-term.  Another problem, those larger refineries do a lot of renewable blending, creating RINs for the market.  Those are hard to come by now and are very high, as well.  The whole oil market is in flux right now.  Need to stabilize.",1,0,1615303664,cptspinach85
