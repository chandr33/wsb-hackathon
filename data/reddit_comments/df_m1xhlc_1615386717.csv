Then sell, bank transfer your money, and put it in a different brokerage. If you can do it today then great, just keep in mind your shares won't settle for 2 days at earliest. Also, if you see on robinhood they won't let you transfer your money out until shares settle, so 4 days at the absolute minimum before you could get your money to another app and settle a but order.",1,0,1615386736,Rellicus
