77,gqi23jv,"&gt; I said it‚Äôs cheaper in the short-term (initial cost is just the fee). Only when they close the position, they put up the cost of returning the share. But yes, overall it can be a more expensive position if trade goes against you.

BUt it's objectively not cheaper since it's the cost of the share + an additional fee...making it...more expensive. Not to mention the inherent risk of shorting a momentum stock. 

&gt; I am taking about individual hedge funds. The employees at Melvin capital are working as a team. 

Okay but that's a disingenuous way of saying ""coordinating"". I also LOL big time at anyone who holds on to ""muh melvin"" memes. Give it a rest, they're small potatoes in this event.
