13,gqg2uxw,"A sneaky plan of yours might be to sell your g m e in December. You bought at $200 but it’s now at $50. You plan on being in g m e until it hits $1000. But in order to predict your yearly taxes, you sell at a loss and tell the government to need a $3000 tax break because you lost in the stock market. The IRS confirms you did by your trade history, and as soon as they do, you buy your g m e back near the same value you sold it at and then ride it to Valhalla. The government knows that trick and so checks on you to make sure you didn’t rebuy the same stock up to 61 days after you just told them you deserve a break due to loss.",1,0,1615385268,Lonely_C0der

16,gqg4izd,"I specialize in taxes. And would rather not see people spread false info. If you sell at a loss and but back into a stock within 60 days then the loss amount is added to your cost basis to simplify the 2 (or multiple) transactions into one. But fuck it, you seem smart. Do your internet research and tell me how the IRS up your ass feels. Please tell me how to do my job more.",1,0,1615386118,newWallstreet
