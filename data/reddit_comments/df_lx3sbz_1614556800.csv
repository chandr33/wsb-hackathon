5,gpkswvy,Looks like an excellent investment based on the fundamentals and numbers. Though the six month chart looks terrible. Where is the catalyst that makes this a bet?,2,0,1614805007,xaekai

7,gpktpba,"I'm worried about the big pull from tech due to very high valuations and previously cheap money driving up the buying of the stocks. Looks like manufacturing and finance are likely to benefit from higher bond yields and travel industry from increasing vaccinations and stimulus combination. 

They are at 50 PE, which is kind of high......",0,0,1614805340,ElegantEntropy

What will matter is SLR relief, stepped up asset purchases, or even YCC (we moon)",1,0,1614817134,PajeetScammer

23,gqeigrv,"Fed already stepped up asset purchases this month behind the scenes. They switched to buying 90% long term paper and have bought more of these bonds than any other month in a year. 

All the other central banks like Japan, Australia, even China have done impromptu unscheduled purchases to keep rates down.

Keep an eye on the 10 year auction tomorrow and then the FOMC meeting the 16th. This will provide guidance going forward for a while.

Personally I don't think they will allow rates to keep going up at the rate they have been. The FED will not allow the instability",2,0,1615343112,PajeetScammer
