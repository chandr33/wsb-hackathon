46,gpppeq6,"Thanks. As a new long-term investor coming at this from longer experience as a day trader in another arena where stoplosses are essential (which I won't mention specifically except to say it's very cryptic and current), who lost lot of money selling the bottom last march, I'm still trying to find the balance between ""cut your losses short"" and ""never try to time the market"".

Right now my main idea is to stay invested through the dips, and  keep enough cash on hand to buy the bigger dips, even if only to re-sell the excess quickly on the way back up to lock in some profits. So I've actually made some extra small buys of my favorite holdings yesterday and today, rather than starting to cut my losses... but, I've been doing it haunted by that little voice saying, ""what if I'm wrong again, what if this dip is the start of The Big One?"" So I'm pretty interested in hearing what more experienced folks think right now, just getting some context that I don't yet have the experience to provide myself.  


Maybe I'll buy some long-expiry puts as well, or something. Just learning about that stuff too.",5,0,1614901141,ApopheniaPays

49,gppq7un,"""JPOW spoke and to be honest, I was shocked. He mentioned that the Fed would let inflation run hot in the short term (meaning yields will remain high in the short term)  ""  


I think you are misunderstanding what he means here. ""let inflation run hot"" means interest rates(yields) will remain low even in an inflationary environment. normally the fed would raise rates to lower inflation. He was basically saying he wont do that. Which means bonds traders thesis that inflation will be hot and fed will raise rates is false.",10,0,1614901551,NaturalFlux
50,gppqpvo,"I disagree. The Fed historically has set inflation targets. They recently changed the mandate such that the inflation target is over the long term with short term deviations been accepted as long as the mandate is fulfilled. 

The crux of this post is that even if the Fed doesn‚Äôt raise rates, the 10-yr yield and long end of the yield curve can still increase, which will deflate tech. The Fed only controls short-term rates i.e the Federal Funds rate. 

I agree that the Fed will keep the FF rate 0. I strongly believe they will let the 10 year naturally rise.",1,0,1614901808,oompaloompa224

I'm only commenting on the understanding of ""let inflation run hot"". This phrase has nothing to do with short term yields and everything to do with long term FF rate being held at 0 in the long term.

Will they pull out other policy tools? idk, probably not. I agree with that part of the DD.",8,0,1614902299,NaturalFlux

56,gqhz78u,"You do know that 10-year yield is entirely based on expectations of rate increases, correct? JPOW essentially said that they would let inflation run hot for the foreseeable future and would not counteract it with an increase in the FFR since the inflation would not be stable. Why did this shock you exactly?",1,0,1615413485,bsr92
57,gqlj093,"10-yr yield is not entirely based on expectations of rate increases. The FED only controls the short end of the curve. The long end is difficult to control and the connection is dubious. The only way the FED can control it is through YCC. 

I was shocked because the FED basically confirmed that at least for now, YCC is off the menu and the situation is not worrisome enough to merit intervention. It is my belief that a rising 10-yr is okay for the overall economy and for the FED to achieve its mandate, but it‚Äôs horrible for growth stocks i.e. tech. FED basically said fuck tech.
