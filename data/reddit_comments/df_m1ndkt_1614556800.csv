5,gqeks9y,With options (naked calls) you have potential for unlimited losses. With stocks you can only lose how ever much you invest. Make sure to always leverage yourself,2,0,1615344367,hugofuegoeggo

7,gqekugd,Dude you will go homeless and with a debt tens of thousands. Just stay with regular stock buying. Option trading is hard and needs a lot of effort and time. It is very risky too. Try swap in swap out shares in different stocks if you want to feed your fever. Just stay with regular shares not option at this time especially.,3,0,1615344399,thesankreturns

14,gqel1w8,"that contract will cost you 3000.  Think buying a house and you put down earnest money when you make an offer a contract. 

When you take the contract, you pay the writer a premium to hold the risk of loss.  

If you were to buy the 100 shares outright, it could go to ZERO and it would cost you $25500 (possible loss of $25500).  However, with the option, you have a limited downside.  If the price rises ABOVE the 255, you can buy 100 shares at 255, but if it goes down to 0, the options expire... but you still paid 3000 to the option writer, but you didnt lose 25500.",2,0,1615344508,sascourge
