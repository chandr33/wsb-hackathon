73,gqf3tcp,"Tauros, the Wild Bull Pokemon.

Ok, so if we go by the data you can see that the best rate to catch the GME bull was at 45, with an initial EoD goal higher than 128. The biggest move you can make with it is Giga Impact at 150 damage, which was a good EoD goal. You can see on impact it weighs in about 194. Now it might have been tempting to sell around 211 (the exp it gives you if you get rid of it), but with base stats of 490 you‚Äôre best to hold onto it. As it matures it can raise new bulls which take between 5140 - 5396 steps be born. Finally, its horns are made of silver.

So based on these projections GME will probably go well past 5140 a share, and if one *were* to be a paper bitch perhaps investing in silver would be a good move... That or the silver will stab you, I‚Äôm not sure.
