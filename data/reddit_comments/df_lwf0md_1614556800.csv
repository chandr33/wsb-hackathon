Too many idiots and hedgefunds just simply shorted RKT and it’s relation to the interest rate thinking a market crash was coming. And I doubt Citadel has any part in this, they are already bankrupt and they know it. After all of the manipulation and naked shorting I doubt they have money to buy calls on it.

Regardless, this has nothing to do with how much money someone gambles with.

I'm glad you made money on RKT. I hope you make a shit ton more. More power to you. 

But don't call for things to be banned just because you happen to not like it. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your generation (and even mine too an extent) is obsessed with banning shit. It's a really shitty thing to do.

Anything not GME, it gets downvoted to oblivion. That’s the problem. I can’t see it if the post gets removed. That’s my issue. This forum has banned plenty of tickers for this type of problem.
