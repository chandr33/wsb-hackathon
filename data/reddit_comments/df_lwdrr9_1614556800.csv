2,gpgrvw4,I love how all 90 percent of accounts talking about RKT are less than 60 days old. Fucking bots are trying to swing attention away from GME,8,0,1614722834,Joe-Dirt-69

15,gpgskdt,You don’t think the hedge funds can make accounts and make rkt boom to draw attention off GME? Like I said I’m happy for all the “real people” that made money,5,0,1614723149,Joe-Dirt-69

22,gpgt02d,"I too was brought here by the news stories about GME.  But to learn to be an ape.  Im over the GME and in on RKT 65@$33.89. I got bit by silver but still holding some as it can't be a bad play long term.   So I fall into the broad ""Look Out For XXXX"" posts but I'm not a bot, nor a shill, nor a financial planner.

27,gpgtjmr,"Yeah, I increased my portfolio by 30% from those, which are also a good mid-long term hold, not sure why you'd even want to bring that up. 

Imagine saying anything about new bag holders when the GME bag holders have it the worst by far. No matter what stock it is, at the end of run-ups there will be bag holders, someone has to be the one buying what you're selling.",0,0,1614723607,The_Moisturizer
28,gpgtmjz,"Believe it or not there are a few new people here, not bots. It’s nearly impossible for new people to post anything without being banned. It’s very frustrating to try to participate and be banned for no reason other than trying to join the group. Most times they also mute the admins so you can’t even ask why or what to change. Not every new person is a bot...",23,0,1614723646,aRifleman2

38,gpgv04g,"I believe it. I’m just saying beware. Check the profile of the people you are engaging with, this is especially important for you new folks. Some users are clearly pushing certain narratives (self admitted GME tard here). Even the wrinkle brains on here make serious errors from time to time. Don’t trust what you read on here, always double check and verify any information that is freely given.",-3,0,1614724300,benotaur
39,gpgw2ea,"Ridiculous that you get downvoted for this. RKT is arguably a good investment even at $40 per share, based on fundamentals (especially factoring the buyback). GME the only reason anyone would pay the current price of $117 is because they think there is this squeeze happening. AMC was in decline prior to COVID. Since then, they diluted their shares and unlikely they will justify a return to even pre-COVID pricing.",1,0,1614724812,aka0007

42,gpgyy27,"So you think hundreds of people downloaded the Reddit app, skipped the naming process, so they could come on here and pump RKT? Which gained traction in the last week or so on here. I guess that could be true. I am but a simple tard humbled by your response. Thank you so much for everything you do to make this community great.

43,gpgz1ri,"Nope, they're just normal users and people are misreading the pattern and then passing around the misconception. imo.

45,gph09x9,"Well if there is one user on this sub I trust, it is you. I should have made my point more focused on users trying to understand the people they are going back and forth with by looking through their comments to see if they are “shilling” or “fuding” any particular stock or the other. Instead of “stock user name bad”. Apologies and thank you for the clarification. I’m not trying to feed into any conspiracy and will delete this post if you would like me too.",3,0,1614726857,benotaur

48,gph2yw1,I find it odd that there are soooo many pushing rkt but they have no dad or reference any!!! And they appeared out of ducking nowhere... 3 days ago you only saw a scattered posy on rkt... now they have gone nuts!
