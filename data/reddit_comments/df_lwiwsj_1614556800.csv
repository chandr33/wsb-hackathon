35,gpi5qjq,"Everyone knows Bidens executive order is just a study and it may not amount to anything. However there is alot of pressure to get these fabs and supply chains fixed, because the demand gets higher and higher due to small supply.

54,gpj6336,"Nope! It's the same as any stock split, and happens when the value gets too high (determined by the company/etf). Say you have WSB company and it's just IPO'd at $10/share. It's a good blue chip company that's not going anywhere, so after 10 years its reached $3000/share. At this point you and I have been priced out of the stock. Even if returns are still good, it doesn't make sense to get 1-2 shares of WSB when I could get 50 shares of a smaller company with similar potential. Companies solve this problem by doing a stock split. That 1 share of WSB becomes 15 (in the case of the ETF). 1 share was worth $3000, so the new shares are worth $200. If you had 1 share at $3000, you now have 15 shares at $200, so you are flat. But if you were wanting to buy in but couldn't due to the $3000 price, now maybe you can buy in, keeping the growth going and going.",5,0,1614778900,esplin9566

63,gq3zphz,"their earnings have gone up for three consecutive quarters (since Q1 2020) and their next report is in May (5/10).  Their P/E (TTM) is at 69.  They are headquartered in AZ, which fits into Biden's local sourcing goals.  Like you said, if this trend continues the P/E will only go down and it seems like this bottleneck will only help that trend.  

It's very convincing.
