3,gpmnlvt,"Smart guy help me understand what the fed rate has to do with mortgage rates? Mortgage rates move with the Fannie Mae 2% coupon. Banks borrow at near 0% not us. The feds are buying MBS, the banks don’t lend their own money (unless it’s jumbo financing and they want to hold the paper). We lost 50 bps today on MBS in our world that enough for 2 rate worsenings. Over the last 2 weeks we’ve lost over 150 bps. That’s enough for a .375% increase in rate not fee. I was quoting 2.75%@ 80% LTV and now it’s @ 3.125% on high balance conforming. You fucking truck",1,0,1614841227,justalurkerpassingby
