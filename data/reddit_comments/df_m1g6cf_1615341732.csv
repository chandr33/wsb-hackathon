I put the money in other things to diversify, while increasing the # of GME shares I have exposure to (eg, 300 instead of 200 because now I've got 3 contracts).

It is a way to take profits but have even more fun on the roller coaster. Of course, the 240Cs are riskier than the 160s were.",2,0,1615341792,commentingrobot
