Feels really weird to me too",4,0,1615394437,Oikkuli

7,gqgoik7,"Because there is so much solid DD on GME already. So many questions people are trying to make seperate posts about. There is a MegaThread for GME for exactly this, and if you do your own DD you can come to your own conclusions.",4,0,1615394644,Rebelsquadro

9,gqgoszs,They would really spend billions of more dollars to short it in hopes gamestop would go bankrupt? when it obviously never will. Looks like they're just giving up and moving elsewhere,2,0,1615394757,RimGreaper6
10,gqgp121,"never underestimate the stubbornnes of hedgefunds when the object is to fuck over the poors

I would be very sceptical they left, they are too greedy for that. They do want you to think they have, though.",1,0,1615394843,Oikkuli
11,gqgpbif,AMC is at 11.76 is that the dip or should I expect it to go down once more.,2,0,1615394958,Ryanowski26

15,gqgpxwx,"Or thatâ€™s just how a short squeeze work??? The  shorts having to cover their positions, pushing the price up for the other shorts who also have to cover, and so on. Thatâ€™s just how it works. The right questions are how much is it shorted and when will the hedge funds cover enough of their positions and unfortunately nobody knows. No one can tell the top of this squeeze, but Im gonna say $400 isnâ€™t it. The 4-digit range is very possible. Donâ€™t try to predict the top with a squeeze, sell on the way down.",1,0,1615395212,Mirikado
16,gqgq8vz,"That's assuming this was actually the short squeeze. I honestlt don't know, I'm a fucking idiot regarding this. Still, the last rally to 480 wasn't a short squeeze, and even that was much more violent than this.",1,0,1615395335,Oikkuli
