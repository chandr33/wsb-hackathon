Furthermore the 100k talk is going to lose some real people some real money. I didn‚Äôt want to make a post and get downvoted to hell - but someone has to end up holding the bag and if you NEED money, don‚Äôt let some random on the internet psych you out of real profits by baiting you to hold forever. They might not, you have no way of knowing.
