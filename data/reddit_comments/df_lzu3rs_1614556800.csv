4,gq413py,"Imo/from my perspective, it's a couple of things:

Firstly, it's partly because information is money,and the way that basically the entire stock market works is by trying to use your data/insight/strategy to outperform everybody else with their data (or by just gambling, as is the WSB way)

Secondly, simply saying, ""everybody should give all of their data away immediately and for free"" is kind of pointless. The reason the delayed/periodic info is important enough to mandate is both for regulatory reasons as well as (more importantly) to maintain public trust/faith in the market. Requiring that this same data be released in real-time isn't necessary to complete those objectives and it's only really useful to make money, so requiring it to be given out in real-time wouldn't really make much sense there.

Would it be nice to have that data as a live feed? Absolutely! Should it be *mandated* that basivally every bit of potentially interesting info is published? I don't really see a compelling argument for it. 

On top of all that, it would probably end up benefitting algotraders and institutions way more than retail traders. Being able to essentially see exactly what the entire market is doing, see what your competitors are doing? That new data would be integrated into algotrading and make finding good plays (that haven't already been taken into account by the big guys) a lot more difficult.",1,0,1615136213,GasolinePizza
