7,gqiidcs,"I really hope everyone gets something out of this. I'm not going to be a millionaire because I've only got 7 shares in at about $148ish, but I know I'm not selling at $600 tomorrow. I know I'm not selling at $1000 on the 19th. I'm not going to experience life changing gains on this one like some of you guys but for ME, a 5 figure gain IS a life changing gain.

That's why I hold. Because it's bigger than you or me. This is US. And we hold strong.",3,0,1615423070,TheOmnisOne
