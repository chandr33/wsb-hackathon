PLTR sky rocketed in after hours. All the numbers you are looking at are worthless right. Those options are all gonna be way up in the morning.

10,gpm4w13,"Who knows what pltr will do. It‚Äôs kind of stabilized itself right around 25. I think insiders are selling and people like Cathy are snapping up huge amounts to stop the price from dropping. Either way I think it‚Äôs a good company to have in your portfolio and the support around $24 is nice to see but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a stock that‚Äôs going to skyrocket to 400 anytime soon.

18,gpm5jlw,Biden administration has used them before and they have a few connects in the the current administration. This means they will continue to be awarded government contracts. Their recent partnership with IBM is also a big catalyst for growth in the private sector. It ran to $45 before being shorted into oblivion. It can easily run it back,5,0,1614829226,captshtpst

31,gpm94at,It fell because it had a negative earnings report where it missed targets. Also that growth is priced into the stock already. Again I don‚Äôt think those are big deals in the long run because I think it‚Äôs capable of sustaining its growth and I think they‚Äôll hit profitability soon (when they don‚Äôt have to pay crazy employee compensation packages) but those aren‚Äôt generally reasons for it to double.,1,0,1614831223,musicantz
