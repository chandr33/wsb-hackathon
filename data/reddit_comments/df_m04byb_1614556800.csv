10,gq5vlyf,I agree with OP. It’s exhausting to see this sub literally filled to the brim with either the three same stocks being mentioned or multiple threads/comments rationalizing why their stocks are going down or some outlandish theories on why they’re about to moon.,1,0,1615166670,HotSauceyBoy
11,gq5vmeb,That's why when you don't know the rules you just go to the table and copy the guys plays next to you because he seems like he knows what he's doing.,1,0,1615166676,Ethikos_

15,gq5x30g,"I’m new here but completely agree. The whining about “manipulation” is ridiculous. 

1) yes. The game is “rigged.” Individual investors on average will underperform vs just buying indices. Most ACTIVE managers underperform. Big funds have all sorts of tools that individual investors don’t have. I could go on and on. But this is it. This is the game and those are the parameters. 

2) you KNOW THIS. If you don’t like it, fcking leave. Seriously it’s like going to a casino and throwing a temper tantrum because you didn’t know the rules in advance. The house usually wins etc etc. You can get an edge but reading a 3 paragraph “DD” on WSB isn’t an edge and you’re out of your fucking mind if you think you *deserve* to be compensated above market return for that. 

3) I’ve seen posts saying that people “deserve” $100K for what “they’ve been put through.” L O fucking L. Honestly you ain’t seen nothing yet. 

4) for fucks save stop with the graphs of stocks that look similar. Yes. It’s how the stock market works. And no, “hedgies” aren’t selling the shit out of tech stocks and losing billions of dollars  to “get retail traders.”",1,0,1615167475,Verb0182

17,gq5xbtb,"I forget what $CSTL does but I looked in to it and I think it's a good stock. I'm not throwing alot of cash at it because I'm new at ""trading"" or whatever you call it. However when I decide to go all in on a stock so to speak, it's not because I've done the research but because of the speculation that more qualified people have found.",1,0,1615167610,No-Doughnut-7505

19,gq5xhuy,The problem is the market did gang busters in 2H20 when a large volume of new accounts opened and everyone thinks you don’t need to know what you’re doing and that 100% is normal.,1,0,1615167700,BagofBabbish
