69,gqa7q3a,"Just to illustrate your point for anyone new to options:

If GME is below $504.88 on Friday, those calls will be worth 0 by Friday.

Those calls have a theta of 2.61, meaning each contract will lose 2.61 (out of its initial 4.88) by EOD tomorrow (assuming nothing else changes). It will rapidly lose value every day that they are far from $500.

|||\-3%|900|
|||||

&amp;#x200B;

The implied Volatility of your calls is about 500% right now. It was 900% at the peak of the last squeeze. These numbers are assuming the volatility stays high. If it starts dropping, then your calls will take a BEATING. For reference, the S&amp;P has an implied volatility of 20%... 500% is huge. For each percentage point the IV loses, your position loses \~4$ (conversely, it should gain 4% on the upside).

If nothing changes, by tomorrow afternoon your position already is down 18%. Time is a bitch.  It's a race against the clock to 500.

That being said, might as well hold them for a bit, because if there is a big enough move by Wednesday you might still be in the clear! Just use this when weighing taking profits.
