80,gqgoood,That was people dumping after holding it at its initial 9-10$ for months. Ironically right after the good news. For some reason it's been increasingly shorted too. Not gme levels but a decent amount. I'm not sure if the indexes buy after the  22 or on its way up to it. If they are buying over the Last few weeks a large price jump may not happen. Another rumor i read is that it would qualify for the 500 if it had more stock in the float. Its at 6% now needs 10% for 500 inclusion,2,0,1615394710,Aces106987

Finviz shows institutional ownership at 13.10%, fintel shows it at 57.43% and nasdaq shows it at 15.29%. Which is correct... who knows.

My understanding is that the market makers have to stay delta neutral, so they only own a portion of the shares that they're writing calls for which is why the squeeze only happens if we can blow through $10 faster than they were expecting. I look at this play like a lottery ticket, there's no catalyst I can see to trigger the squeeze, but in the off chance it happens the calls are super cheap.",1,0,1615397590,crypt0Thr0waway69
