61,gpnm7ov,"&gt;I can see a correction with money moving from the fast tech and the like into stocks that suffered the most (airlines, oil, cruises etc).

Agreed and it remains to be seen how well they do imo. 

&gt;
&gt;But Interest rates are still very low, the vaccine roll due is gathering full steam, employment goes up from here and TINA.

Interest rates being at 0 is partly the issue I have with the current market.

I think the vaccine hype likely is priced in by this point and I also get that ya have to dance until the music stops. Hence SPY 399c. Seriously, I'd be really surprised if it went tits up. I'm dead serious.

However, while employment will go up, wages likely won't very much. Which is somewhat of a problem when we've had quite a bit of inflation due to a reduction in spending.

Or if spending does go way up and interest rates goes up, that's a one way ticket to default town, and that's the thing I'm mostly looking at.

&gt;Nothing suggests a major crash is coming. 
&gt;Zoom out of SPY and look at the last 6 months. We have had dips before.

True and we're in a dip right now I think (seriously SPY calls are looking great to me), but the uncertainty is what gets me.

We are in uncharted territory in so many ways especially when the buying of corporate bonds and the unbalanced inflation that it causes a lot of uncertainty. And that's a problem for markets.

Obviously I'm not like saying SPY 80 or anything (I'll maybe say that if the US government starts YOLOing into TSLA FDs :P), but I think it is something to watch for in the coming months.

Again, it's my (probably uninformed) opinion but I think the makings of stagflation and other issues are there.",1,0,1614868253,justcool393
