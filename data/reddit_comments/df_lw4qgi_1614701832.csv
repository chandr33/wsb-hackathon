30,gpff8so,"You guys are a bunch of retards... Investing into a single stock that has no real upside and is hanging its hope on one man and a vision. Dumping countless dollars into stocks and options that are going to bring you nothing but heartburn and headaches... And you know what? I dig it. I like the direction of the company. I like the upside. I'm a fucking gamer. And I'd love nothing more than to see these rich fucks squirming like they are in thay scene from Dark Knight Rises... ""Exile or death?"" Fuck it... I'm in. Keeping what I have and buying the dips again and again and again. Way to go you autistic fucking diamond handed apes. I love you all but most importantly, I love the fucking stock.
