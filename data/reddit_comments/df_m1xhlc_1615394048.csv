2,gqgmx8z,It’s funny because if we think from a shorter’s perspective and zoom out to the 3m chart they are probably shitting their pants right now that they’re about to start losing money on top of the interest they’ve had to pay. If I was a short that got in at the top of GME last time I’d be out right now or fucking horrified. This has retard energy we will go to fucking Pluto 🚀🚀🚀🦍,6,0,1615394049,IJustWantaQuietLife1
