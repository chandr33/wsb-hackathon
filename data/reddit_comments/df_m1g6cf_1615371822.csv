69,gqfkemm,"So I‚Äôm very new to investing. Loved what you did with the first wave and was gutted I missed out so I got on for the second wave. I have a theory (but like I said I literally just started following a week and a half ago and my only stock is effectively a meme stock so please tell me why I‚Äôm wrong with my following theory), but the last few days it‚Äôs flying up in the pre-market which is while US hedgies are asleep. Now just think of all us retards I happen to be European but surely the vast majority of us are US, maybe a 3:1 split? I know we‚Äôve had very tasty gains the last 2 days but this suggests to me that in market open hours we would be flying up by 3x as much as the incredible gains in the premarket only that‚Äôs when the hedgies are there to manipulate the market and cause dips which in turn makes some people doubtful about buying and clearly it‚Äôs working in a sense because even though we are mooning the last 2 days we should be mooning even harder during the day if the pre-market is used as a guideline. If I‚Äôm right about this, the moral of the story literally is what you‚Äôve seen countless comments saying, be brave, buy the dips, dips are fake. We are going moon but with bravery we can get there quicker and go even further",1,0,1615371957,PolskaLFC93
