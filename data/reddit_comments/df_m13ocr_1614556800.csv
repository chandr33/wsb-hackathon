0,gqbb3fa,"Not really, it's just coupled with GME right now, so it's going to see the same kind of trends.  It should be trading around 6.5 to around 8 in my opinion, and all these spikes do is worry me that it's going to crash hard when it decouples, possibly hurting recovery as everyone scrambles.  You can make a lot of money playing the coaster that it's on, just be prepared to take some profit so you can buy back in on the dips to average out.  AMC is not the same kind of company as the other, and will probably not see that spike to 200 anytime in the future.  If it does, it's going to crash hard, because the company is just starting recovery.  Play it how you want, I'm a stoned retard, I'm bullish long and mid term, but kinda bearish about near term.",1,0,1615285705,bigsoftee84
