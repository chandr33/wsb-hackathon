5,gqctdx8,I use vanguard and it seems like these limits are 4x as high or something. I set a 1k sell when it was trading at ~200 in Jan but it wouldn’t let me do 1.5k. Vanguard is a really great brokerage.,1,0,1615313577,kkballad

13,gqcvwv2,"Maybe, but I think that's just the market reacting to a high price level. 

Also depends on how quickly it gets there. If it slowly gets there, that shouldn't trigger quick sells, considering that there will be people that are in at entry points closer to 500 than where many in WSB and elsewhere are. If it moons, GET OUT. Don't be an idiot. Market will and always consolidates. 

That GME is slowly, but aggressively, climbing over this past week is one of the best signs for bullish growth.",1,0,1615314742,jcsnyc
