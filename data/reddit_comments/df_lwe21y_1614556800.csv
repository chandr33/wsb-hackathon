**TLDR: RKT 🚀🚀🚀💥💥💥🛸🛸🛸**

What a crazy day 360,00,000+ shares traded today!!!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ

**Some interesting info Before I go out for some 😎 🍺**

* **115 Million Shares in the float 👀 👀**
* **121 Million Shares Owned By Institutions 😱😱😱😱**
* **5.8 Million Shares Owned By insiders 😱😱**
* **RKT Guided Q1 UUUUUPPPPPP 90%-99% YoY 🚀🚀🚀**
* **RKT Is Doing A Billion Dollar Share Buyback 🌈🐻 = 💀💀💀**
* **Special Dividend Coming Soon (No that wont cause a squeeze, it DOESSSS Add Pain to the Shorts)**
* **RKT ISSSS STILLLLL NTB (None To Borrow) 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱**
* **I Can See 60 Strikes on TDA**

I have no idea what is going to happen the rest of the week with regard to the price

***BUT***

The shorts took a 2-3 Billion GME and thought they would wait it out instead of taking **SOME PAIN early they ended up losing, what was it something like 70 BILLION $$$$$!!!!**

The shorts can absolutely drag this thing out **AS LONG AS THEY WANT AND HAVE $$$$ FOR**

**BUT**

What I saw with **GME** is the cost to cover goes ***EXPONENTIALLY*** over time (my OP)

**My First RKT post 13 days ago (NO 💗❤️💞 FOR ME ON IT)**

***NOW I AM THE MASTER 👑👑👑***

\*\*\*""\*\*\*Here’s a moment. All the world and more has rushed eternity’s length to reach this beat of your heart, screaming down the years.

And if you let it, the universe, without drawing breath, will press itself through this fractured second and race to the next, on into a new eternity.

Everything that is, the echoes of everything that ever was, the roots of all that will ever be, must pass through this moment that you own. Your only task is to give it pause – to make it notice."" -Guess Who

***DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.*** Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment.

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. ***All trading strategies are used at your own risk.***

***DISCLAIMER#2:*** The risk associated with any position you take is inversely proportionate to your bank roll. The act of selling naked calls or shorting stock carries with it an infinite amount of risk. Unless you’re a fuckhead over-leveraged clown of a fund manager, then by all means your losses will be capped by The House.",-1,0,1614723470,YoLO-Mage-007

It takes that level of obsession chasing the next trade to do something spectacular.

By the time a good trade becomes widely recognized, it’s usually too late.  

What’s special about the GME stuff is we had someone presenting good arguments for a full year before it happened.  His reward for that year was being called an idiot hundreds of times.  

Read the actual DD posts religiously and you might get clued in on a good move before its to late.",29,1,1614725607,-Blixx-

I was getting close to saying fuck this j need a break even after reading the RKT DD. But woke up this morning and said fuck it. My options started bleeding as soon as I got em and then turned around to make up what I lost the last 3 weeks. You can’t hit em all just try and sort through a lot of the bullshit that’s posted and find the gems. I’m relatively new at this too. Risk what you can afford to risk don’t get greedy when you’re up a shit load. My calls were shooting up and as it went up I sold some here and there. Leaving 2 there to see where they go.
