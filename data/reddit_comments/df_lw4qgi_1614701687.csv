I must be a dumb ape because this makes no sense to me.  Even ""if"" it falls back down to 50, that is just break even and they loose the premium, right?  So.. They are hedging it will go under 50 by Friday?  I think I am doing it wrong so I went with the cancel button.",6,0,1614701690,hyteck9

I know there a crap load out there but its confusing..

I see some simple ideas behind it but when I go to buy actually buy something I don't understand what the hell I am reading on my fidelity trade platform.

I want to pay x amount of cash to buy 100 shares with a strike price of 1xx. Profit if it goes to the moon or lose x amount of money if it don't and let the call expire.

I don't want to purchase all the stock, I don't have enough cash to purchase 100 shares but I am willing to risk 500 or so.  If It goes up take profits, if it goes down then pay the 500 price tag and have no further commitment.
