Melvin Capital is going to throw a lot of tricks at us that will make it look like the stock is dropping. Don't fall for it.

Do not sell if you see any of these things happen:

    GME drops by 30% or more after hours
    SEC filings show that shorts have all exited their positions
    GME drops below $1 a share
    The Gamestop locations near you start closing
    GME files for bankruptcy
    GME is delisted from the stock exchange
    Your bank forecloses on your home for late payment

These are classic hedge fund tricks.",37,0,1615399312,Marky0choa
