7,gqbnrwx,"Stopped watching Uncle Bruce after the first squeeze on January. When GME was skyrocketing in Jan, he was hyping it up and had all the technical analysis on it. When it dipped to the 40s, he said it was over and don’t see it coming back. Now, when we’re starting to take off again, he comes on and ride the wave. 

I’m totally cool with yall apes sharing his clips and the things he says. Just remember, he’s not always right.

15,gqbnshh,"Up to you to decide. If it dips today it'll be easy to ""lose"" money, but when the squeeze happens you'll be thankful you bought. It would be a risky buy, with potentially huge reward. Don't spend money you're not comfortable letting go of.

I bought in at $180 pre-peak and then had to hold for two weeks and buy the dip to bring my avg down to $100.

Hope this helps!",1,0,1615295552,alfonsojon
