18,gqb4m3t,"Raising wages actually don't cause that much of an impact on prices (inflation). When McDonald's had to increase the minimum wage, they raised the price of a Big Mac by 12cents. Sorry, I don't recall the source on this :( The major effects of raising minimum wage are raising people out of poverty and businesses making a little less profit, but obviously this can hurt smaller companies more than major corporations.",1,0,1615279239,Camposaurus_Rex
19,gqb4v6x,"Ya, something along these lines. I believe the Fed's words were that they would keep doing QE until the jobs participation rate increased (number of people working and applying for jobs). If you compare the Fed's balance sheet with the participation rate, they're inversely correlated. Meaning, the Fed *is* the problem or *is making the economy worse*.",1,0,1615279488,Camposaurus_Rex

21,gqb8fmp,"This may be true on a limited scale, such as McDonald's.  Widespread, drastic, instant wage increases can be a problem.  Raising the minimum wage won't bring people out of poverty.  The actual dollar amount of wages is meaningless.  What matters is where you are on the scale in relation to other people.  The minimum wage could be $100/hr. and the lowest paid would still be the lowest paid.  Their buying power would still reflect that.

The people that would be hurt the most by drastic wage increases are seniors.  They are commonly living on a fixed income.  Their investments are typically very conservative since they don't have the advantage of time to recover from losses.  Major increases in wages and inflation would decrease their buying power and leave them in a vulnerable position.  I know many people bash the boomers, but I don't think we really want to fuck over our parents and grandparents so high school kids and people that never bothered to pick up a skill can feel better about themselves.",1,0,1615283099,chiefoogabooga

24,gqbdwb5,"I dont think I agree with your reasoning.

After 2008 the phenomena of credit cycles have gone away more and more with the years. This evolution of the market is something economists are still trying to understand and we lack the theoretical frameworks to make accurate guesses about how credit cycles have changed. ([https://creditmarketdaily.com/credit-cycle-what-credit-cycle/](https://creditmarketdaily.com/credit-cycle-what-credit-cycle/))

The way I've been looking at the future of inflation for the dollar is through the MV=PT formula where we see both a big increase in the total monetary supply but also a increase in the velocity which is both the big diffrence to the 2008 quantitive easing and the reason there should be more inflation. Now there is an argument to be made that the debt present in the avarage household will counteract this inflation so god knows how things will actualy work out.",1,0,1615288318,Sunt123

28,gqbkjde,"Sonic took the opportunity to raise the price on their burgers by $1. Which was probably a substantial increase on their profit margin even after the additional wages, but could also represent an increase in their food costs from the wage increase mandate. I'd like to see their books. In general, minimum wage increasing is good for big business and bad for small labor intensive businesses. A few of the local owned pizza places switched their driver's to waitress wages during the last increase to stay afloat, which lead to those driver's switching to national chains and those small businesses closing shop eventually (after they switched back to standard minimum wage and increased their prices).",1,0,1615293474,Alphawog
29,gqbl1zf,"It'll probably drop stock prices of labor intensive industries because of the expected cut into profit margins. In my opinion, buying big players like Walmart or Amazon at the bottom of that dip would be a good play, because they can weather the wage increase and invest in/utilize technology to decrease the man-hours required while smaller competitors are driven out of the market. It'll benefit them in the long run.",1,0,1615293819,Alphawog
