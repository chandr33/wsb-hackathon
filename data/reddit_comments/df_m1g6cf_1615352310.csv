62,gqey4n0,"Guys my favorite small cap just hit a billion dollars so I can shill it here finally.  I have done really well with it and I think you can too.  It's CRMT.  They sell used cars in the south and midwest.  It's a growth company that is growing fast.  They sell in 12 states but in a few years they could expand to 48.  They are actually profitable.  

The thing with small caps is they aren't liquid.  Which means it's hard to get in and out so big hedge funds can't build a position easily.  Not only is it growth, it's value with a PE of 15.  No matter who wins between EV and Gas cars, used cars will always be  good business.  Check them out.  I think this is a great company for smaller investors.",-2,0,1615352394,hgfggt
