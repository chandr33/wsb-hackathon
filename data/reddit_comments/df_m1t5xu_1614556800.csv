3,gqfesjx,"There are entire ski slopes in the desert built off slave labor that's literally fueled by oil. What do you think, some conglomerate is gonna get together and fix the oil prices? Like some sort of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or some shit?

So this ""OPEC"" you're describing is gonna what ... withhold oil until it hits a price they like? Those snowy slopes ain't gonna air condition themselves. And what about the other countries? They make enough oil to not need to get strongarmed by this oil cartel you're describing. So what happens when they just release their own reserves to keep their own masses calm? That's right. The exporters calm their shit too and put out at a resonable price. Just like your wife.",1,0,1615366594,Faedro

9,gqff58w,You should hold your oil for a little while but weâ€™re reaching the point where green energies are becoming cheap and efficient enough to replace oil. Oil probably peaks in a year or two before steadily declining before its dead.,1,0,1615366941,jodatoufin
10,gqffmrq,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615367380,VisualMod
11,gqfg9xr,"Yeah I know about the problems caused by extracting oil. Fracking is just the dot of the i.

I discussed this with both the boyfriend of my wife as well as the wife of my boyfriend, and we came to the solution that it can only be solved demand-sided. It's up to the production sides of every country. Yeah as long as Saudi Arabia can sell their oil at such high prices, there will be skiing slopes in the desert. Imagine an oil price so damn high that no one thinks about buying.

I know, welcome to utopia. But sharply rising prices are the only way to reduce the demand on a short term view. And we Def need short term viewed solutions now.",1,0,1615367957,lil-falko
12,gqfgn5e,"My car has 400hp and gets 18mpg. It has a 5-cylinder engine, and sounds amazing. I love my car, so I also kinda like oil.

Know what I hate though? Traffic. I hate it so much, that I'd volunteer to have another human inside my car during the 'me time' of commuting if someone would promise me traffic would be half as bad.

Hey. I bet that would also cut your climate worries in half too.",1,0,1615368294,Faedro
