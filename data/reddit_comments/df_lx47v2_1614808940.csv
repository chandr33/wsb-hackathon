64,gpl2271,"Yeah, it's close to $5500 a put and I'm considering ***two*** puts. After that I will have no capital to trade with.

Here's my reasoning:

It's had limited profitability and is reliant on sale credits, and has a sky-high valuation relative to other car manufacturers. TSLA is just extremely overvalued, intrinsic value last weekend, TSLA was literally $32.70 a share compared to its $675.50 share price. I went down the rabbit hole on TSLA last weekend and I just came to a conclusion. Soo much money invested with all of it going to manufacturing then selling. Simply put supply and demand, bitch. Those fucking cars are simply too expensive. after reading up on what Michael Burry has been tweeting, I was starting to buy the idea of a big short. Burry sold his position on GME, right after, got on twitter and trolled Elon Musk with pictures of Teslas exploding. I am starting to believe a Tesla short will be the next big short.",1,0,1614808996,andrewpwiener
