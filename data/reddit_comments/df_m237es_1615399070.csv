4,gqh0ojl,"Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.",8,0,1615399071,RutabegaSuede
