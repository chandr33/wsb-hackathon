0,gqd5yfo,"I’ve been bagging since $86. Averaged down, but still in pain. If I had more $$, I would certainly throw more into it at this price.",5,0,1615319398,dragom7
1,gqd62qa,I dropped 10k more in at $75. Absolute bargain.,3,0,1615319452,CMurr1711

3,gqd6ms0,Agreed. Seeing the upcoming announcements it’s a steal right now,2,0,1615319702,Will_I_Mmm
4,gqd7am9,AMD is like the kid that pulls a switchblade out and stabs the bully in the neck,6,0,1615319994,fdlfsqitn
5,gqd7bg2,They need to compete with nvidias CUDA core and need higher market share of data centres than intel. I like the stock too.,2,0,1615320004,ShitFeeder
6,gqd7f2o,DLSS and raytracing is good but I don't think it will be the main factor that will hugely boost revs.,2,0,1615320049,ShitFeeder
7,gqd7hk0,Agreed! AMD had a new hire of a server market veteran that apparently is very well connected and will help turn the tide.,1,0,1615320079,CMurr1711
8,gqd8heq,I wish I had known how to invest back in 2014. $2/sh now they're up over 80.,3,0,1615320532,lostknight0727
9,gqd9748,Bought in at 54$ and didn't regret. Only sold when gme craziness started. Will definitely be going back to amd!,2,0,1615320856,SCHUUG
10,gqda02x,"Yeah, I think they will get there but at least in the short term the GPU shortage is the great equalizer. Their sales will look the same as long as every card that hits the rack is nabbed immediately.",1,0,1615321218,Colluder
11,gqdfbav,I agree with a lot of your thesis. I'd add that AMD gets the potential to grow if the market shrinks by continuing to take market share from Intel. The constraints at tsmc is the biggest headwind since Apple is hungry.,2,0,1615323568,acoolname332211

14,gqei7cp,I want an image of AMD shanking Intel and Nvidia in the stomach,1,0,1615342973,Environmental-Put-36
15,gqf3j7a,"Tell me about it. There’s no reason MU is still high and AMD is not. I think investors are exaggerating the supply issues here: AMD has a lot of inventory being rolled out.

Moreover, if you don’t think folks are planning a second Christmas shopping spree (re: AMD-powered consoles, AMD-powered laptops) with those $1400 stimulus checks, you are too naive.",1,0,1615356384,dragom7
16,gqf3m1z,Then buy AAPL as well. That’s also on a discount!,1,0,1615356447,dragom7
