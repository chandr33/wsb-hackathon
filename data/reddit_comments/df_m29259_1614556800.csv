6,gqhvme8,"I don't think the hedges are at war, and today was definitely run by institutions. If you don't think they have caught on your crazy. The big dip was the hedge sell off to take profit. I am sure they are realizing that news, social etc are driving this. I believe what your seeing is option buys from the last run being put in play here. Think about it you could own calls, that were bought on the cheap after the last crash to under $40. They could purchase attractive calls. The whales have the pockets to start a run back up by buying (dumping new $$$),  that would push those calls to ITM and they can cash out the calls they purchased on the cheap and double up. Look at the short interest % drop in the last 1+ weeks from 40% to 20%. This may have been a short mini squeeze, but I think it was something else.
