4,gpnv2no,"While I appreciate the attempt I reject your thesis as far as it applies to me. 

I'm 50, unmarried, haven't loved a woman since I was 17, no kids, and grinding away the remaining years in a job I don't care for in an industry that is going to be replaced by Elon Musk.

My death would mean little. Thousands of men my age kill themselves every week and the powers that be give it little notice, what with women getting asked out by men they aren't interested in. That's obviously the important issue and the last 50 years has proven that repeatedly.


So then, I'm either going to get rich or die trying. It might surprise you but all roads lead to death. I'll die by my own hand or with a pile of cash and small children that I paid a surrogate lavishly to produce fo me.

I have no allusions to ever finding love and no delusions in thinking that rich or poor any women will show an interest. And let me be quite frank here so no one misunderstands me: after living all of my 50 years listening to every way that women hate men I also giveno ducks about them.

Now that's done real equality.

Yes, I almost lost it watching my gme shares drop from 480 to 40 and not selling because everyone said diamond hands. Gme is literally the first stock I ever purchased. Sadly the stocks I purchased after we're nok, pltr, and bb all at or near their tops.

I'm down over 20 of my initial 60k investment.

My solution was to get whiskey drunk and cry until I fell asleep. 

But I haven't quit and I won't until I hit zero or 10 million.

My life is irrelevant and to me this is the last chance to make it means something.

Everyone dies. Having no children means my death won't matter if I die today or thirty years from now. Well, I'm sure the government would like to squeeze more taxes outofme.",1,0,1614872300,Bull_Winkle69
5,gpnv45p,"Your heart dumps adrenaline just at the thought of checking.  ""Not this time"" you tell yourself.  ""I need to actually get work done today"" you lie again.  You glance at your computer, checking for something that might require immediate attention.  No alerts.  So you look.

Fuck it's down 5%!  I should sell.  Nah I'll ignore it.  Close the app.  Uh oh Teams alert.  Better check on work....

You open the app again.  The stock is middling.  ""Where is the squeeze!?"".  You squeeze your hands, hoping to send physical energy into the ethereal.  The price moves.  Did you really just change the market? 

Shit I went AFK on Teams.  Better wiggle the mouse.  

You open the app again.  The stock is up!  Nice!  Is this the top?  Should I sell now?  Diamond hands?  No, I should read some DD to strengthen my hands.  I really should work.

You open the app again.  Shit it dove!  Hard dive!  Fuck there went 10%!  I gotta stop the bleeding!  No no, diamond hands.  Let's read some more DD.  Shit I didn't respond to that email.

You actually work for 20 minutes.  Somehow you space out the market until close.  It's WAY UP in post market!  Wow!  I'm up like a thousand bucks!  Holy shit, I'm gonna spend the night dreaming about what I could do with a thousand bucks.  Better keep checking that post market.

2am - why am I awake?  Better check for a midnight price correction.  Can that even happen?  What's wrong with me? 

5am - I better check again.  Those hedgies are up to no good! 

7am fuck it im awake.  Better watch pre-market. 

830am.  It dove so God damn hard all my post market dreams are ashes.  I'm gonna actually get work done today instead of staring at red and green lines.

There's your problem retard.

All those people could have ""gone after what they wanted"" like you but didn't, live with your decision or take time and invest in yourself so others see you more valuable to them.

50,gpnyfmi,"I‚Äôve been there. Never over money but that feeling of hopelessness... like things will never get better. It‚Äôs a very difficult thing to claw your way out of but I‚Äôve done it more than once and I don‚Äôt wish that on anybody. Every time I‚Äôve ended up in a much better place than I‚Äôve ever been afterwards. Still run into some debilitating lows, no doubt, but believe me when I say it WILL get better if you LET it.

I dunno man it‚Äôs crazy but I believe there is someone or some... beings? things? I dont know what watching over me and bringing me opportunities. Money comes and goes but friends, family, pets; those are what matter most when you can‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore.

There is a silver lining to everything, even tragedy, and being able to recognize it for what it is changes your life a lot. Sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre just lying to yourself but sometimes that‚Äôs what you need most. I used to think of myself as nothing but a fuck-up but recently I‚Äôve found a very different outlook on life. Honestly not much changed other than how I choose to look at and think about things, which is inexplicably more difficult to actually do than the statement attempts to suggest, but that change brings about many more positive changes.

Get outside, go for a hike and appreciate the view. Do something you love and are passionate about be it painting, working on a project car, discussing things on the internet in autistic detail with fellow enthusiasts, helping others, spending time with loved ones, whatever. I list those things because they helped me a lot. There is so much to enjoy in life beyond money and even losing it all isn‚Äôt as big a deal as you might think. It‚Äôs possible to recover from complete bankruptcy in MUCH less time than you likely fear and it‚Äôs not as hard as you might think to start over.

If the negativity here is too much to handle then leave and never look back. It means this shit ain‚Äôt right for you and you‚Äôve yet to find what is. Searching for that thing can be so much more exciting and rewarding than actually finding it. Never forget that.",1,0,1614873769,Bungboozler
