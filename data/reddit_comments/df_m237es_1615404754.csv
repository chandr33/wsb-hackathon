&gt;  
&gt;[https://nimb.ws/GFgzBe](https://nimb.ws/GFgzBe)

Basically some larger institution sells large orders which pushes the price down. If you have a level 2 trading access you can see the order size. This is also available in some other places as well but you might need to search for it.

Once the price is down they can buy at more convenient prices their positions. I doubt there is any individual apart from DFV who could sell 400k or 800k shares at once (I am not implying he sold it is just an example).",1,0,1615404765,wowsuchcookie

78,gqhezk9,"I have 20 shares. Selling 2 @ $350, $400, $450, $500, and $600. It's a careful stagger. 
Then I have 10 that I REALLY want to ride to the moon. 

Today is not the day. Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe Friday.  Any day before the 19th has wild potential.

I don't think it is unrealistic to expect $600ish in the next day or 2. If not then,  before the 19th. 

$600 feels low ball for me too. $1000 will impress me, but it wouldn't shock me. 

It's volatile today. But, if we get through today in the green, we will be sitting pretty.
