Not necessarily. There are a lot of people totally new to the stock market here just to ride the GME squeeze for some easy money. They would cash out most of their earnings and put that money out on the streets. Some of the other actual investors would take some out and keep some on to invest, but either way, I think that most would be taking some money out, which would increase inflation.

Trust me. I was up $770k last round.  I lost it all because of all the shit advice on here about removing stop losses and holding no matter what. 

Let me tell you, it‚Äôs the same thing as losing that much minus taxes. For a few days I was a millionaire.  All life‚Äôs troubles went away.  Family was going to get surgeries, a roof, debts canceled, dental work, etc.   i gambled with all those things and lost. Managed to sell during the fire sale and walk way with like $30k which is part of what I‚Äôm playing with now. 

I lost the purchasing power for things in my life  just the same as if I had $500k (factoring taxes and my initial investment). 


The only difference is I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to a lifestyle of having that much money, so it was a bit easier to swallow as I went about my normal life (after a few anxiety attacks). If I was living a life with that much money and peace of mind I would be in much worse shape right now mentally.  Also Bills would probably be harder to pay if I dropped from that level whereas I have my normal bills. 

If you wouldn‚Äôt put in $350k today then pull it out and leave in whatever you would put in at the current level.   Everything else is speculation.
