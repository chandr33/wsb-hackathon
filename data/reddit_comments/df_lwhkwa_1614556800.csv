2,gpheiuh,"What needs to be kept in mind there is at least 200% synthetic shares of GameStop (I.E. fake shares) so their short interest represents that too, they say it‚Äôs 60% shorted on at least 300% of the actual share number which means at least  180% of GameStop is shorted!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ so my fellow apes no matter what as long as we stick to the cause and hold gain momentum tell everyone to buy gme!!! It‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed money, there is actually a better chance of this rocket taking off than any other stock on the market!!! This is just one apes opinion who has done hundreds of hours in research I went all in at 38$ every pay will continue to go to the cause!!! I‚Äôve spent more on dumber shit!!! This is probably one of my best purchases to come ü•∞üòçüöÄüöÄ Yahoo finance shows the truth look how much of the company % is owned the short interest is calculated off of that too!!! I did the math they can roughly pay 20 million a share before they are insolvent if they liquidate everything

Ps: my apologies about run on sentences but I own 2 companies and extremely busy but I made time for this!! When I say all in at 38$ I mean it!! I can always make it back we‚Äôre young..  we couldn‚Äôt make this opportunity come back!!",24,0,1614734170,Mvpkillla
