Here's a few:

MACD indicator bullish? Yes.
Frog day is later this month, one day after the quadruple witching? Yes.
World happiness day is that same day? (McDonald's gives out free ice cream.) Yes.
First Chewy board meeting included a trip to McDonald's for ice cream? Yes.
That specific ice cream picture was from an article about a certified APE who is hold or die GME gang? Yes.
Ann hand worked for project frog and McDonald's? Yes.
Frog is the symbol for transformation, kinda like Cohen plans for GME? Yes.

Did he mean *all* of these things? Maybe not. But I would put money on *some* of them.
