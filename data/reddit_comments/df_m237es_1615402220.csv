5,gqh8t42,"SEC is underfunded and doesn't have enough teeth. It's unable to attract top talent. If you had the ability and understanding to manipulate or recognize market manipulation and make bank or to go to a government job with shitty pay it would take an awful lot of personal integrity to choose the government job. So that means the SEC is getting a mix of third rate people who couldn't hack it, real diamond ass integrity people, and shifty revolving door types who only go over to screw things up and keep the money train going.",16,0,1615402222,brotherbond
