7,gqhy6x5,"There’s no irony. It’s trading high based off nothing fundamental. “My kids play it hur dur hur”. Not profitable, not even during covid when ALL kids were stuck at home glued to their screens. 

It’s stupid",-2,0,1615413044,fugly_nerd

9,gqhyt3a,"?? recording losses hasn't meant much for years, they're either reinvesting into the company or their business model sucks. Tesla is infamous for recording losses but it's one of the most valuable companies in the world.  


It's up to you to decide which is true in this case",2,0,1615413312,mrBusinessmann
10,gqhzlri,"You’re comparing Tesla to Roblox. Come on. Tesla is “overvalued” bc it’s literally the future. People believe in that shit down to it’s very core. EVs, renewable energy, the software etc. 
Roblox.... ? Eh maybe it’ll make u some money from hype but just like all games, they tend to die, kids grow up and move on, etc. The upside is there’s always new kids to fill their place I guess. 
But really all it takes is 1 viral article on the child predators using the game to lure in kids and RIP. 

Just my 2 cents and I work in the gaming industry. Have positions in tech and I would buy Roblox but not for what their “valuation” currently is.
I don’t think it’s a terrible game or bad investment, but for what it’s currently trading at.... yes. Bad.",1,0,1615413665,fugly_nerd
11,gqi03ye,Do you even know what Roblox is? Lmao... do some DD. Maybe get on the website and see how it works. Roblox has been a cash cow for 10 years and will continue to be.,2,0,1615413892,CsDirtyTea
12,gqi0ozh,"It’s a video game every one of my nieces and nephews plays. I played it before. 

I did do DD that’s how I arrived to my conclusion. Not everyone has to hop on every single tech IPO. I can be bearish if I personally do not agree with the valuation. You’re allowed to be bullish. But saying “do some DD” is counterproductive af and helps nothing. If you disagree you can state your reasoning if you’d like. It has its moments and then dies and the kids are on Minecraft again. It’s a cycle I’ve seen the last 6-7 years working in the industry and having 14 nieces / nephews between 3 years - 15 years",1,0,1615414155,fugly_nerd
