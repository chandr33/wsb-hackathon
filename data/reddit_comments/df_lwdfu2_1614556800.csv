19,gpgtcpw,"I live within 20 minutes of 2 of their stores in Texas, and there are always people lined up at open to try to buy ammo.  The ammo shortage is supposed to last well into next year, and Academy gets more regular shipments and doesn't mark up as much as the mom and pop stores do.

On top of that, all of their stores are currently in red states, where people buy a fuckton of ammo.

They have built-in foot traffic from gun owners who are likely more predisposed to buy the rest of their sports and outdoor inventory(softball gloves, grills, golf clubs) than non-gun owners and all of their locations are in red states - 38% in Texas.

They increased net income 112% in 2020.  And ammo shortage is supposed to run into 2022.",3,0,1614723517,Luka-Step-Back
