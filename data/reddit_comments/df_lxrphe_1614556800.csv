0,gpok6t1,"Yo, I played these before the capital riot and decided to hold through inauguration, and RGR’s earning were the best since 2016....

Like wtf",4,0,1614883071,Foomaster512
1,gpola0i,All of the firearms stocks are unexplainably being crushed lately. They are all making record profits yet being hammered. Seems like clear manipulation...nothing else makes sense when these companies are making money hand over fist.,5,0,1614883525,ofhs93
2,gpot1wa,"Both of these played so well from April to September 2020 and then we had ammo shortages, all time gun sales, daily gun violence and widespread riots, but they both started getting crushed each day. I was able to sell at a profit, but it lost so much of its gains when every earnings report was a new record. The financials and the stock price are not in balance.",3,0,1614886733,ScalliwagFinance
3,gpou9f8,"Do firearm stocks do well under Democrat admins?  Serious question, I've never really looked into it, but if weed stocks jumped on the rumor of legalization, wouldn't it make sense that firearm stocks would take a hit on the possibility of future regulations?",2,0,1614887227,bigsoftee84
4,gpour2i,The realization is that the regulation doesn’t ever happen and they just make more money than ever under Dem admin...Its hard to understand that the market can’t see this. There’s no way to 60 votes on the regulations in the Senate...and after the redrawing of districts this year the R’s are going to win in a romp in the house races for 22...for a market that is supposed to always be looking down the road at what’s coming there’s something they seemingly miss about these companies....I feel like it has to be the wokeness factor...but I’ll keep taking the divi money and eventually people do wake up and can’t stay away from massively undervalued stocks.,6,0,1614887429,ofhs93
5,gppaxrh,"I don't get it either, because I always hear that they make bank during Dem admins, but enough about politics so as not to anger anyone about anything stupid.  The ammo shortage was a big ding against some of them, I would guess, or does it mean there's more room for growth?  I'm a bit medicated, so I don't really know.  I used to follow them pretty close when I was in the military, but I've been disappointed in a couple of purchases from companies I thought I could trust with quality, and kinda just moved on.  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'll take a look at some, and see what kind of products they're putting out.  If I'd buy the product, I usually get the underlying long.",3,0,1614894304,bigsoftee84
