45,gqip01p,I agree with the overall point though. I sold covered calls off GME and from November to February. I made a modest few grand but nothing crazy and I bought 5 shares at $320 in solidarity on the first peak. I bought 1 more at $186 yesterday for a total of 6 and sold a 5 off today at $335.,2,0,1615426581,CapnCrackerz

47,gqipooy,I think it's possible it will hover around $150 for some time. I really feel like this stock is actually becoming more and more diamond handed. So much float is locked up that the ticker price barely matters. I have no idea how MMs can manage this type of volatility and low float... but they deserve whatever cash they get from doing so.,2,0,1615426928,pennyether
48,gqipsvx,"I YOLO'D the first squeeze, played it incredibly poorly, but still managed to more than double my money by realizing it was over on the Friday. 

Bought back in for 1000 shares at $69.69, and then sold CC, bringing in a little over $16,000 in premiums before I was assigned out at $70.

As demonstrated today, this one will end far, far, far faster.

Probably by the long whale switching to short by selling their calls and buying puts nearly simultaneously.

53,gqitc49,"My best guess is it stops going back down somewhere around $60, which was the line it stopped going down quickly. 

It really depends on how determined someone is to drive it down, and how much people keep holding. 

I do strongly believe it will go down WAY faster than last time. Someone is running this to make billions. And they are perfectly ok making money going up (calls) as going down (puts).",1,0,1615428809,Megahuts
