I had an accident as a child. I fell face first onto a concrete porch and just about knocked all of my teeth out. My parents were dirt poor and couldn‚Äôt afford ‚Äúcosmetic dentistry.‚Äù

I grew up not smiling at all. I learned to talk with my lips covering my teeth. I heard all the fucked up nicknames. Yukmouth. Snaggleooth. Etc. 

As an adult who had insurance and a savings account with a little bit of padding, I finally did something about it. 

When I saw my smile for the first time I literally Cried.
