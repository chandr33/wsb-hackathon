3,gpizhft,"$9 premium would show up as .09 because it‚Äôs a cost per share x 100. So IF it hit $800 and OP wanted to exercise the contract (buy 100 shares at $800) his break even price per share would be $800.09

800 is the strike, 800.09 would be the break even

5,gpj1gqp,"Not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say.. but this trade literally impossible to have now. Stock could hit $1k today... nothing will have gain like this without putting a lot more money at risk.. 
I know I would have fucked up prob .. not selling. Especially if I only paid $90.. lol",1,0,1614776107,Mysterious_Error_852

7,gpj88jb,"Look up implied volatility and learn your Greeks. As they get closer to ITM and the price starts to climb faster than an Ape up a banana tree (plant) they become more valuable. Even if they are still not even close to ITM they gain value when the stock price spikes drastically

*Edit- the contracts become more valuable that is",5,0,1614780067,Stonks_GoUp

9,gpjax5f,"Thank you for the reply :) I was also confused as to how he realized profits on an option with the strike price of 800$ when the actual price of the stock was so much lower, but I guess the options premium increased due to extrinsic value I imagine? It‚Äôs just tough for me to see such a massive gain on a weird option",4,0,1614781451,JohnOswaldJones

15,gpk5acp,So the person who bought those think it will be more than 800 per share on the 5th? Or think the options themselves will be worth more?,2,0,1614794794,DrunkSpartan15

21,gpk7stl,"Okay so I‚Äôm looking at a covered call of one of my stocks. If I were to make a contract, I am setting the strike price at time of purchase right? So that means I‚Äôm agreeing to sell this stock at strike. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the ticker goes up or down. So someone buys the contract, can choose to exercise it. When the contract expires, do they have a grace period for choosing to exercise?",1,0,1614795876,DrunkSpartan15

27,gpl77zy,"There was some previous DD where someone identified a large short position had been entered (with a bunch of call options to prevent them from getting GME‚Äôed).   It was very cheap to buy a put and I kinda just wanted to see what would happen.  

Sure enough, that put is teaching me a lot about the value of implied volatility.  My option is still not near the money yet it‚Äôs worth +40% more.",1,0,1614811389,JayArlington

34,gpoe2mv,"Thank you for your serious reply to my half-serious question.  
Last night I inadvertently finally dove into learning about options deeper than calls &amp; puts after being inspired by deep ITM call options and how they have high deltas and Intrinsic Value. Which I then contrasted with extrinsic value.   


I think I get intrinsic value, but extrinsic value sort of escapes me. If you have a chance, could you give me just a short blurb of your thoughts?",2,0,1614880505,FreeHKTaiwanNumber1
35,gpoovtp,"Easiest way to simplify EV is to think of it as a ‚Äútime value‚Äù. The longer time before the option close date, the more EV contributes to a higher contract price. This is because there‚Äôs more potential for changes in the underlying stock price over that time.  If a call contract expires in 2 days, there‚Äôs very little EV because there‚Äôs not much potential for a wild shift in stock price in 2 days. This is not financial advice, I am not an expert. It‚Äôs much deeper and has a formula based on more than just time.. but I tried to keep it simple for conceptual sake",2,0,1614885039,Foreu2env
36,gpop577,That's perfect thank you foreau. I have a basic grasp of time value from a personal finance class years ago and your explanation sealed it. Appreciate your non-financial advice from a non-expert,2,0,1614885147,FreeHKTaiwanNumber1
