3,gqevwq7,See hereâ€™s the thing.  RBLX isnâ€™t an IPO.  Itâ€™s a Direct Listing.  Which means who ever already owns shares (which they bought or were given to from RBLX over the years) can now sell them to new fresh starting 3/10.   This is similar to close out periods when insiders can now sell.,6,0,1615350921,Tito_Mojito

9,gqex8p6,"Donâ€™t forget they had to wait a little while due to not doing the accounting for revenue correctly (they were apparently low balling their revenue) I still havenâ€™t seen solid DD on this company thatâ€™s been around for a while except for the parents saying their kids spend so much $ on it but in their metrics they only show about $40 per user (can someone confirm if this is over the life of the account or monthly/yearly/etc)? 

That being said they delay revenue recognition so itâ€™s spread over almost 24 months (based on average life of account) so much of the spending that occurred in Q4 of the last year wonâ€™t show up till spread into 2021/22",2,0,1615351792,Stonebeast1

17,gqf0wjv,"Its a growth thing......and when blockbuster was competing with netflix *(2002-2008)* blockbuster was earning twice as much as netflix! And blockbuster was spending 1/3 of what netflix was spending!

We all see how that ended up.

The really good companies reinvest all their money into growing themselves into a market dominator.

The best way to make all the money is to have a product so much better than everyone elses product that you can raise your price and no one complains. Thats what netflix has now. How mucj do you pay for your netflix subscription? You dont even know! But you cant turn that shit off.

Its the same with coke. Remember a few years ago when a bottle of coke was $1.69 or so? Now that thing is consistently $2 or more, donlesn't even matter. Coke is the right choice if you are going to buy a soda. I only habe 2 or 3 per week so if i get one i get the best one. Coke is it",1,0,1615354366,active_military

25,gqf3ik1,"I can confirm the $40 per user is likely quarterly if not monthly (I would bet monthly). My daughter would play this shit all day everyday if she could. 

That being said: this listing is suspiciously late/delayed. It's starting at $45 at the ""end"" of the pandemic. Sure we have a few months before everyone has a vaccine, but we are presumably only going to have three to six months of our kids playing this like it's their job, then they will get a taste for hanging around friends again and wanting to not sit on front of computers all the time. That may sound crazy to gamers my age and a bit younger, but if it was all you had you would actually put it the fuck down.  With that in mind, their user base will grow for six months and kids will move on to a different game/system.

If this listed with shakey numbers at the beginning of the pandemic, I would line up to throw money at it. At the end with similar shakey numbers and knowing firsthand the userbase, monthly ask from a definitely addicted kiddo, and the nature of kids to jump and completely abandon a game.... I'm going to say wait a week to see performance, but make your money before September 2021. These kids will be back in school and this will be the first luxury cut if their grades aren't good, or if they act up in school.... 

It may be an absolute gold mine, but I would point to the success of SPACs as an indication of why IPOs ( I know this is different, shut up for a second) are not something anyone wants to deal with during the first week. Let it get some legs, but you are going to see seasonal dips and Covid consequences economically on this one.",1,0,1615356370,baddisguise1

The growth of roblox works like social media, the quality of games go up each year because of rising popularity. So it keeps users coming back to see the ""new game"" on roblox.  Roblox is much like a endless gaming catalog for kid/teen to easily play on any device they choose from. Jumping from game to game takes 0 downloads, and is a little longer wait time than waiting for a youtube video to load. Games in the industries problem is keeping a player base, however, ROBLOX does not and will not have that problem. The more players, the more developers, the better the games.
