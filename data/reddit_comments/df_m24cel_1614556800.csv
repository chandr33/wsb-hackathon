4,gqh3kvx,When the stock reaches the price point you set. You shouldn't buy without an expectation of where you want it to go.,2,0,1615400160,WhyMustIThinkOfAUser

6,gqh3ol2,"I think the main play is waiting for the short squeeze, when prices will really skyrocket. That could take awhile, but when it does, prices will be X amount high and should last for a few days for you to get out. That's about a summary of what I've gathered from reading hundreds of posts on here daily.",2,0,1615400198,Mr_Squiggles_
7,gqh3ox4,"Totally 100% up to you. Some people are happy with a 10% gain, which is what they'd normally see in an entire year in something like VTSAX.",3,0,1615400202,hwtactics

11,gqh3rsq,"Up to you. Honestly, exit when you feel like you can't make more profits, and can only make losses from that point. Although if you believe the squeeze hasn't squoze, hold and you can see exactly how deep this rabbit hole goes.",6,0,1615400232,perrilloux
12,gqh3siu,I'll sell a few at around 800 to get back what I put into it. But with the majority I'll wait to see the 100k mark.,1,0,1615400239,Karmmah

14,gqh3uv9,"Most will tell you to hold forever. I say just hold until you are happy with your profit. Personally I try to take out some of my profit, and then buy the dip when it comes. Rinse and repeat. I never sell it all though.",2,0,1615400265,legoturtle92

18,gqh459c,I would suggest always buying in pairs. Suppose you make a 50 dollar profit. Sell on  keep one. Thi then allows you to have a stop loss of 50 dollars( though in reality it's 0 since that 50 was profit). Or sell during high times and buy fractional shares woht only profit ( that way its completely fine if you ride it to the ground),3,0,1615400379,cristofercolumber

21,gqh4do5,"And wen u make losses, try to cut it by reducing your average cost by buying more shares ( so if your old price was 200, now its 100, average cost becomes 150 - so you can sell at for eg- 160 for 20 dolarr pofit istad of waiting for it to cross 200)",1,0,1615400470,cristofercolumber
22,gqh4gkc,"Your money, your decision. I usually sell to get back my initial investment once I'm around 200%. Then keep my gains invested depending on the climate around the asset.",1,0,1615400502,Digi-Trex
