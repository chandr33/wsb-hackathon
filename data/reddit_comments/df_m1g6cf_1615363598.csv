31,gqfbu7u,"Yep I‚Äôm still following the DD and as I said I think there‚Äôs still a case for a squeeze. I‚Äôm more so less confident about the crowd I‚Äôm seeing on wsb. They believe anything you tell them so long as it confirms their bias, many bought in late and are just trying to turn a quick buck on money they cant always afford to lose, there‚Äôs now a ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù set by the January price rise which would indicate price will drop significantly at some point (yes I know the reason for this was trade halting but in the eyes of someone new or not paying attention, it may look like $400ish is the time to sell), and the bag holders from last time may be waiting to be ‚Äúrescued‚Äù just so they can sell off and get the money back that they couldn‚Äôt afford to lose last time.

Let‚Äôs put it this way:

Imagine Tesla monopolized car sales in California. Imagine you couldn‚Äôt buy anything but a Tesla. Now imagine Tesla closes all their dealerships and says ‚Äúsorry we don‚Äôt have any cars right now, but if you pay 1000% more we will‚Äù. So you pay. And you never receive a car.
