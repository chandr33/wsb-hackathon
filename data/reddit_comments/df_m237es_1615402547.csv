37,gqh9n4i,"I wish I had a chart that showed at what stock price trades were halted, but I don't. There's just fewer halts on the way down than the way up. Also, if a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted.

But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.

I do know it was halted after it dropped from like $337 to $302 for five minutes, then halted for five minutes again when it started trading again and dropped from $277.21 to $248.68, then it repeated when it dropped to $216, and then $198. Let me know if any of this is wrong, I don't want to be spreading misinformation.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, that all looks about right around the 10%.",1,0,1615402556,RutabegaSuede
