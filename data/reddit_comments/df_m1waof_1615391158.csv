They were reverse splits. They alter the historical prices when they are performed. 

Since I know you’re a robinhood mouth breather, search ticker GUSH on the 5 year chart. It says there was a high of $26,800 in Dec 2016. This never happened. 

What happened was the stock reverse split numerous times over the last 5 years which drove up the historical prices to appear higher than they ever were.

20,gqgh6w8,"Ok well I just did some research on it. You failed to.mention that DRYS was trading at $1.5bn per share 11 years BEFORE the squeeze from $4-$100. I couldn't find much about outstanding shares other than from 2011 when it was a whopping 1 share but here is a quote from seeking Alpha article about it. 

""DRYS hit all-time high about $125 a share in October 2007. After numerous reverse splits, the below are the adjusted all-time highs and lows:


=$125 x cumulative reverse splits 11,760,000 (=25x4x15x8x4x7x5x7)

= $1.47 billion a share (adjusted theoretical all-time high)

= $3.50 / 11,760,000

= 0.00000030 a share (adjusted theoretical all time low)""

Let me help your mathematically challenged brain.

If company X has 1 stock worth $1000, then they reverse split 100 times, you DONT multiple $1000 x100 to say that the company X (1share) was worth $100,000.

So this result the shares to be reduce significantly, which the chart you say is after adjustment thus the price.

At some point it became obvious that it wasn’t worth throwing in the towel as they will either throw in the towel, or have the towel thrown in for them when they go bankrupt. But as long as the match continues there is always the slight chance that either an outside official stops the match (bailout/forgiveness from SEC or govt) or their opponent (Apes) slip on their own sweat (paper hand) or get struck by lighting from a divine being (paper hand).

If I was a HF manager that’s the legitimate mathematical play. You’ll never recoup the losses and exit the position legally in any reasonable amount of time or way that doesn’t lead to bankruptcy so why get out? Just like people holding onto stocks the have 100% of their portfolio In drop super low. Selling only confirms the loss. Even if all signs point to no growth and continued loss, holding for any hope of a gain is the only decent play as 0$ in RL is worse than 0$ but have the option to recoup if the stock magically comes back.",1,0,1615392902,Trackstar557
