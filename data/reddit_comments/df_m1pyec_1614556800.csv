1,gqezad7,Other tech and growth stocks recovered only 5 to 10% yesterday. Tesla increased double that.,0,0,1615353191,abdul10000

5,gqezcqw,"You have one subjective and erroneous comment in your hypothesis; ""overvalued"". Value is determined by the market, fundamentals and growth potential. Please expound on why you believe it is over valued.",2,0,1615353238,Hopeful-Flounder-203
6,gqezjec,"How much did TSLA lose on the way down compared to the average? I ain't gonna look at the numbers but you should. Probably just normal swings with the rest of the market. It's not that unusual given last week. It is a little surprising because I think TSLA is overvalued. (don't kill me, just a personal opinion, I have no positions).",1,0,1615353365,ShyLeBuff

11,gqezxvh,"That's one metric of equity value. If a car company has the ability to put a dagger into the entire auto industry and a 10 year head start, what should its forward PE be, in your opinion?",1,0,1615353652,Hopeful-Flounder-203
12,gqezyml,"No offense but TSLA was getting killed 2-3x more than other nasdaq stocks. 

Also for no good reason btw. 

No good reason for either tbh. My best guess is MM we’re trying to shake retail investors out to get them back for GME. Idk.",1,0,1615353667,Redditlover1981

14,gqf07ap,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.

16,gqf0e17,Uh no it isn’t,1,0,1615353980,Rick_Perrys_Asshole
17,gqf0f7b,You claim that if it went up 20% it must be wrong.  Why? You're mixing technical analysis and financial fundamentals to suit your personal prognosis and projecting it on others with the hope of making your narrative true. Pick a side: technical or fundamental.,1,0,1615354004,Hopeful-Flounder-203
18,gqf0ru5,I dont agree with your head start estimation but have to point out that Tesla is still bound by limits of industrial businesses. It can't scale production to meet demand in the same capacity as online tech companies. Yet many people value it using the same model.,1,0,1615354267,abdul10000
19,gqf10fb,Sir - Technical analysis of past price history is the equivalent of driving forward by looking in the rear view mirror.,1,0,1615354448,Hopeful-Flounder-203

21,gqf1c3f,That's a fundamental.  Totally different than technical analysis that you're espousing. Do you understand the difference? Don't cross wires on it or it will fry you.,1,0,1615354693,Hopeful-Flounder-203
22,gqf1dvt,what is the technical answer then?,1,0,1615354731,abdul10000
23,gqf1o10,The technical answer is moot. See earlier comment.,1,0,1615354942,Hopeful-Flounder-203
24,gqf1pkh,well you made a fundamentals argument so I replied accordingly,1,0,1615354973,abdul10000
25,gqf27pv,Tech answer is I made 20% in 2 days and will bank it. I like the stock long term and will buy it back on the next dip. Good day.,1,0,1615355358,Hopeful-Flounder-203
26,gqf2d0s,Worst thought pattern ever. How do those numbers predict what should be bought or sold and at what price??,1,0,1615355471,Hopeful-Flounder-203
