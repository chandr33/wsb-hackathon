People had a promise of wealth and they perceive the promise is under threat. This creates anxiety. This anxiety causes frustration.

So minus the cult narrative, it is very easy to understand why people are aggressive.

GME is still a good buy, even right now. There is justification for trying to be on the right side of a potential gamma squeeze. It IS also a good stock to have puts. Missing GME is the worst play. There absolutely is money to be made. It's which side wsb takes is what decides it, in my honest opinion.

I don't think it'll trade sideways indefinitely. It's more likely to tank, or moon. We have people we trust suggesting it'll moon. People we don't trust suggesting it will tank.

Thats why it appears cult-like. From an outside perspective it is easy to perceive that narrative, because you trust the people we established quickly to distrust.
