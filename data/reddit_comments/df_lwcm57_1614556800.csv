12,gpgkf9m,Denmark. But most countries in eu have high taxes compared to USA. USA is 0% tax if u dont make more than 38k. Thats insane.,1,0,1614719579,spacelyyy989

26,gpgl5q0,"Oh, I pay zero tax on gains in Sweden (using an Investment savings account) but pay a rate of (simplifying shit) 0.375% on the capital that‚Äôs held in the account. Losses are non deductible though. Anyways I‚Äôm a good little socialist so I keep my investments red and avoid making profits at all cost to avoid dodging taxes on my gains.

31,gpglwcb,But are u serious about the investment saving account not paying taxes?,2,0,1614720196,spacelyyy989
32,gpgnnog,Yea healthcare but in my country is highest tax in EU and dont get me started on the food prices and car insurance and apartment prices and etc. You have like 10% money left when you paid for everything.,1,0,1614720970,spacelyyy989
33,gpgoq0t,"Dead serious, but you do pay 0.375 % on the amount held in the account so if you just keep cash in the account (a pretty bad idea but possible) you still pay 0.375 % tax per year on that amount. If you‚Äôd made a killing on GME, say that you put money in your account bought at 20 then sold at 420 and withdrew the cash making you a million dollar profit, you‚Äôd pay like a thousand bucks in taxes (because of the short time frame).

Please do note that this is in a country that some consider socialistic.",1,0,1614721430,SureGovernment
