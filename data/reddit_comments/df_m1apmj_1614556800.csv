10,gqcjbno,"Let me ask you, how fast would you go to see a marvel movie or any other film in Imax and 3d? If restrictions are lifted, you'll see the herds in droves going back to their creature comforts and injecting money into the economy and the stock will rise.",22,0,1615309176,2utes
11,gqcjej3,"AMC has great potential. Sure it‚Äôs more convenient to stream at home, however, the reason why people go to the cinemas is for the experience - watching the movie on a big screen. Besides, AMC has made quite some changes recently for the better.
I believe it‚Äôll bounce back up to 20$+",11,0,1615309206,Pwheeris

19,gqcjygl,"I snagged AMC shares back at 6.5 in January and I have no intention of selling. USA is primed to have a majority of the pop. vaccinated by end of May. You know what that means? 

Summer blockbuster films. People will come out in droves. I could even see studios re-releasing movies they put out during the pandemic, to ""get the theater experience you so deserve"". 

This is not financial advice (I'm unemployed!!! hahaha); I just love the movies.",10,0,1615309443,WornInShoes

24,gqckhye,The movies will always be profitable for the simple reason that I wouldn't go to a guy's house to watch a movie on the first date. Or a girl's for that matter. Kind of dangerous if you don't know them that well. The movie theater is a public place where you can go to meet people you don't want to bring home just yet.,2,0,1615309682,EchoBlossom
