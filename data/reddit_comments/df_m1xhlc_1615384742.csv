88,gqg1yz9,"Good morning, retards.  

  
Also, good morning CNBC, HFs, etc.   Allow me to explain a few things for you, because you still aren't understanding anything.  Over the last week, 2 things have been said on here that I'd like to repeat, and you to think about:  


**""They entered a battle of attrition with  a generation of people with fuck all to lose...""**  
*(Editor's note:  More than a generation.  It's not just zoomers.  I'm Gen X, you've all been fucking us over for a very long time.)*  


AND  


**""They shorted gamers.  GAMERS.""**    


I can make back what I put in within 2 days.  I put in $398, total, as that was all I had, and still all I have to put in this at the time.  And if I were to sell to break even, or even get just a little over that, NOTHING in my life changes.  


OR  


I could say, ""fuck it, what do I have to lose"", and hodl as long as necessary to see where this goes, and maybe, just maybe, come out with a whole lot more than I started with or have EVER had, all at once, in my lifetime.  


If I lose out, I just work 2 extra days.  My life stays the same, I just had fun for a little while.  
But if I don't lose - EVERYTHING CHANGES.  


I kind of think it's worth it since the worst I'm out is having to work 2 days I might normally take off.  


There is no panic on this side of it.  There is panic on your side of it.  
I literally can hold a lot longer than you can scowl, look down at us, and wag  your finger in our face.  

I do not have a single thing to lose here, and everything to gain.",1,0,1615384796,SerenityFL
