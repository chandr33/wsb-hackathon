Just as soon as the market opens at 9:30? How are new call options priced when they are created? Guess what Iâ€™m asking is how much can I expect the new options to cost as soon as they become available?,2,0,1614732576,Puzzleheaded_Deal784

54,gphej8a,"How options are priced is a long question to answer. The short version, options prices are a combination of intrinsic value plus extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is how much they are worth if executed right then. So if you have a $20 call and the actual price is $10, your intrinsic value is 0. If you have a $10 call and actual is $30, intrinsic is worth $20 x 100 shares = $2000.


Extrinsic is much more complicated, but it's basically a function of implied volatility (IV) and time until expiration. Options for a stock with high IV are more expensive because the price can move quickly in a short period of time. Options with a further expiration date are worth more because you have more time.

59,gpheubs,"But to answer your question, look at how options are priced on another similar IV and price stock (good luck finding one after today's rip) and you can get an idea how the price drops off as the strike price goes to the top of the chain.


Just know buying more options tomorrow means you're buying when IV is off the charts, so if it doesn't move quickly they will quickly become worthless.",8,0,1614734336,Sittin_on_a_toilet
