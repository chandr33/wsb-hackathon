3,gpgf471,"Here is where the risk is, when it gets announced and the date gets close yes the ratio in price will solidify. Problem is we do no know where this price could be both companies could drop significantly with tlry decreasing more. This would lead one to think maybe I can short tlry and go long aphria, this is already built into the current price disparity with interest rate and unexpected chance of the merger not going through. In short if you are bullish on these companies yes aphria is the better buy and actually has a better downside should the merger not go through",4,0,1614717340,Damastawilliams
4,gpgfafr,"I'm under the impression terms can change with the deal, 80% value now but tbd the actual value. Plus, I'm too new and not savvy enough to be able to comfortably bet on this situation, I was thinking the same thing as you but decided to wait until I see a big wave forming. If what you posit is the actual case, I would be led to believe large firms, HFs, brokers, banks, and retail investors with large buying power would be jumping in on it already. Basically that would indicate to me its time to buy more, I'm already holding quite a few APHA and TLRY and was thinking about getting more, but as I said, not savvy enough to comfortably make that bet.",2,0,1614717413,radsmash66

6,gpgfq8v,"I'm a new investor. I have a traditional ret account. (After tax deposit because taxes will go up in my opinion) anyways. I am trying to do research on any investment i make with my non retirement account, ie: robinhood. I do like the news coming from aphria. New deal in europe..anyways even though I don't understand the short/bullish terms I get the main point. Thanka.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)",1,0,1614717602,thisperson316
7,gpgg1y4,Me PERSONALLY.  I am unloading atm. Gonna keep a very very small amount of TLRY. I got APHA around 17-18. Haven't looked in a while. But since it's going up slowly steadily I think I'll buy some more. Just gonna me cautious. But still nervous.,1,0,1614717741,thisperson316
