61,gpo32sc,"Okay, I'll take a step back and assume you're actually in good faith.

How does buying a share in a cash account before selling a share from a margin account help the shorts? Is it not correct that by those shares being in a margin account, in the first place, they are **already** being loaned out and used to write new short deals **against** your shares? 

By getting them into a cash account, it takes them off the table and those short positions will either have to be closed, or the broker will have to hold onto the shares, themselves, to maintain the underlying short positions. Meanwhile, you'll have removed a number of shares from those who try to short it.

Yes, they cannot loan out your shares on a cash account, and yes, your shares are already being loaned out by being on a margin account on Robinhood.

64,gpo7p71,"Okay, I see what you're saying. My strategy is based on an assumption (call it a bet) - that one of the main reasons we saw the drop after 1/28's with the halts and ""new investor funding"" for Robinhood was due to substantial short interests entering Robinhood.

The stock was already overshorted in January. We know they were lying about having closed their short positions at the time, and have good evidence that they've been doubling down by hiding their deals within ETF trades, etc.

I'm betting that, just like before, they're not just *shorting* the shares of Robinhood account holders, ***they're over-shorting them***. I think that they're taking my shares, loaning them to a short seller, which is bought by another ape, whose share is then borrowed again and shorted again. 

If the chain of short-sales they created off our shares held within Robinhood averages to &lt;1:1, I concede that you'd be correct. **That said, I'm willing to bet that they are trying to get out of this the same way they got into it**, and the chain of short-sales is &gt;1:1. 

I think they went to a large, fresh pool of retail accounts, nearly all of which are available to be borrowed from due to their ""instant settlements"" default setting, and have been trying to keep down the price *with our own shares*.",-2,0,1614877773,n_ohanlon
