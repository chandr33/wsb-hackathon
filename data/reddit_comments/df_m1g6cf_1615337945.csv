Says he needs to raise $500K by friday because he would hate to halt the development of  this new technology for lack of funding.

Funnier thing is, the dude is asking for math help ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/m0w6oq/need_help_solving_math_problem/)) in r/mathematics so he is probably not a software application developer.
