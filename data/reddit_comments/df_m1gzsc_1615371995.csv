18,gqforbw,"I bought in at 130 and then again at 60. Both times got laughed at by coworkers. Bending over, slapping their knees laughing followed by calling me delusional. One guy would brag about their initial gains on the first squeeze and preach that the shorts all expired while condescendingly warning me that wsb is a cult and GME will go back to $4. They bought puts on GME last week - I am assuming out of spite. Same guy who pushed the narrative that he was a revolutionary bringing the Hedges down is now betting against GME. Guess who hasnt said a word to me all week? Im gunna buy them a GME giftcard with a note: sorry for your loss.

People on wsb gave me shit when I said I got my gf involved buying in at 76. She couldnt be happier with the investment. She looks like how Paper Hands wives look when they get back from a weekend Sandals getaway with their boyfriends.

I was already in at an average of about $312 and when he sold out I bought the amount equivalent to what he had owned for myself and it averaged me down to $286.

I like the guy but I always got the impression he thought I was a retard for holding at such a massive loss. If this baby skyrockets like nothing we've ever seen before the joke will be on him and I will feel very smug to say the least.",1,0,1615379820,Templar_Legion
