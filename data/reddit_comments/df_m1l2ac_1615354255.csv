1,gqf18zq,Thank you kind ape. Have a 🍌 for making it to the end! 🚀,1,0,1615354627,DrinnoTTV
2,gqf1ecl,You get it. This summary is succinct and precisely what Billy intended. Well done! And thank you 👍🚀🚀🚀,1,0,1615354741,DrinnoTTV

4,gqf1ppu,"Given what I've learned, risk mitigation is a huge part of playing with stonks, especially volatile ones. The ultra-wealthy have insane amounts of capital they can use to hedge their bets and prepare for disaster. Apes do not. So it makes perfect sense that cost recovery is (usually) the best option.

Maybe Billy opened a 🍌stand with 100 🍌. The first few 🍌sales would go almost exclusively to paying off whatever he spent to start the stand in the first place (overhead costs). Any 🍌money not used to pay off the initial debt is likely being used to keep Billy from starving or going homeless... Having covered the startup costs, Billy can move forward stress-free with the knowledge that all the rest of his 🍌sales are entirely profit.

Everyone should think like Billy, if you want my not-financial-advice opinion. It's just good business. And just for perspective, the 2008 bailout was $750B. Even if the shorts had to buy the entire float twice, they would still have to pay $7500/share to reach that total. Considering the Covid stimulus packages have printed over, what, $7T now? I don't see them getting a bailout this time. The DTCC seems to agree, if you look at the rules changes they are attempting to implement. Take from this info what you will, and of course...

Also, what happens when the ball lands in zero (or even double-zero if you’re playing American roulette)? You lose all outside bets. The game is designed for you to lose. GME is arguably a much ‘safer’ play then Roulette. If roulette could be beaten, why do any of us have jobs and why do casinos make money?
