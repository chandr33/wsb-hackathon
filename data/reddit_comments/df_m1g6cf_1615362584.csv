9,gqfapi9,"It sounds to me like you’re looking at this in only one dimension: does the company make a profit?

Yes, both companies turned profits out. Even if Tesla is losing money on every car, they still turn a profit while offering a product. It’s fine to lose money in some area while profiting in another. 

Let’s take an example: imagine if Wayfair said they would never replace a broken piece of furniture again. That would mean major profits to them as no money would be lost on replacement shipments, replacement parts, extra warehouse workers etc. saves money short term, loses tons long term. You could make the comparison that “if they’re losing money on a service, they’re like Enron” with any company. 

The difference here is an end consumer actually receives something. Enron never produced a single watt of electricity for anyone. Their revenues were completely fraudulent and stolen money. What does Tesla do that is fraudulent and illegal to make it comparable to Enron in any way?
A product is still made, and offered",1,0,1615362604,Noticeably
