Plus, there isn't the ability to simply hoard all of the value as many will sell some shares which will result in the tax revenue you mention. Also, and I know this is an intangible, given how the people who will be receiving the funds are wired differently from HFs, they will reinvest in market, or their communities, or any other venture where they can actually help and not resort to selfish short selling.
