76,gqhalrz,"To everyone who said I was selfish and greedy for wanting to get rich quick off of GME, I just want to say, this was about SO MUCH MORE than just getting rich quick.

This was about finally being independent and making up for lost time in life. Getting to move out, have my space, and catch up, starting while I‚Äôm still somewhat young. I‚Äôm 25 now.

If I would have went in at $40, and put in half of my savings, I could have at least made $30,000 right now. Not enough to be really free, but safer for when I lose health insurance by the end of the year and either have to buy my own or pay my medicine and doctor visits out of pocket.

A lot of you just think I‚Äôm another greedy selfish bastard looking to get rich quick, and you‚Äôre not COMPLETELY wrong, but I have explained my reasons.

I know it might sound like I‚Äôm not taking responsibility for my own actions, but my family really did disadvantage me, and it turns out that‚Äôs the case for millions of other people too.

I just wanted to be free, and prove to my family I could beat the system that they think they‚Äôre just forced to follow.

My will to live was already dying, not sure if I‚Äôll make it another year now.

I should have listened to my FOMO, I regret listening to all of the so called ‚Äúfinancial advisors‚Äù, like the *Motley Fool*.

I don‚Äôt care about being wealthy when I‚Äôm an old man, I‚Äôm 25, and life has been nothing but abuse and isolation, and now I‚Äôm just lost.

There‚Äôs no real help for us struggling in the United States. Even my fucking psychiatrist agreed that the system is too focused on profit and wealth for the few, leaving many people to go without.

GME could have been my way out, perfect timing too. But once again, I listened to other miserable people telling me to play it safe.

I just want to live, decently, and free from being dependent on others, and really that even includes employers. Working is such a joke in general....",31,0,1615402952,wokeinthematrix
