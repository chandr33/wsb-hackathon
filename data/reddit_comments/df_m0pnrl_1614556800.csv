3,gq96pqw,"This is good advice. One thing I would amend slightly: consider getting a password manager. I use LastPass at home and 1password at work. Both have the ability to generate secure passwords. I honestly have no idea what password I have for almost all of my logins. Most importantly: DO NOT REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS. Every site gets a different password so that if one is compromised, the damage is limited. 

I would also say make sure your email account is secure (long, hard to guess password, 2FA). IMO, the most important account you have is your email account, because once that’s compromised an attacker can do a lot of damage (like click “forgot password” and have a new one emailed).",2,0,1615237288,SportTheFoole

7,gq9cdjr,"Potential issues with Lastpass (https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/lastpass_android_trackers_found/).  Personally I use Keepass (and keepass2android).

Get yourself familiar with OTP and get a decent OTP(open source) program - not google authenticator app.  Again I use 'andOTP'
