4,gqhqlwk,I've seen DD that suggests RKT was a pump and dump. I'm not sure about that though. I'll link it in a reply to this comment when I find it.,2,0,1615409724,JessasaurusJames
5,gqhr5l1,"I'm still very interested in RKT, I already cashed out $1800 so far from a small investment (20 bagger and 10 bagger calls) and am looking to the coming interest rate hike as their opportunity to capture more of the older school mortage market. Their platform is only threatened by the speed of closing of UWMC deal now exclusive with other brokers. 

I see both UWMC and RKT being good plays with RKT being a sooner payoff and UWMC being more steady and slow upward trend. Just my smooth brain opinion, but by years end I see RKT at a stable $31-35s floor and UWMC tickling 20 hovering at about$13-16. Of course that is entirely speculative and very optimistic on how long it will take raising interest rates to start negatively impacting the mortage industry.",1,0,1615409959,Siceless
