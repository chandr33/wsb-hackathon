27,gqi0tpt,"HF have an upper hand because in the short term it‚Äôs cheaper to short than buy stock

HF have the upper hand because they are controlling the price of every ticker on the market. Full stop. But on top of that, it is objectively more expensive to short a stock since it's cost is Price of borrowed share + interest. Which is why most short trades are momentum trades that are closed out intraday.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I said it‚Äôs cheaper in the short-term (initial cost is just the fee). Only when they close the position, they put up the cost of returning the share. But yes, overall it can be a more expensive position if trade goes against you. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

They also have order flow info (so they know stop losses)

This information is not hard to find for free, and most pleb services offer it outside of RH. This isn't a unique feature only HF's have and it certainly isn't their ""big stick"".

can be coordinated (unlike retail)

They're not coordinating, they just have more money than WSB. It's simple math.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I am taking about individual hedge funds. The employees at Melvin capital are working as a team. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
and can time when to short to trigger stop losses (not hard to predict halts).

Except for the fact that the halt was a reaction to the sold shares. They didn't short it right before a predicted halt, they literally caused it by flooding a highly volatile stock with a fuck load of market sell orders.

Apes advantage is that there‚Äôs a cult around the stock &amp; their loss is capped at their investment.

Nope, apes have 0 advantage. In fact, HF's only real advantage is that the 'apes' will do anything to maintain the belief that they are the ones in control, despite 0 evidence pointing in that direction.

Not trying to bust your balls homie, but you're just so damn wrong about everything you're saying here lol

I don‚Äôt think we disagree. I do think the HF gave advantage because of all the tools they have at their disposal.",0,0,1615414214,Original-Baki
