10,gq3xipm,"When I started investing, I lost a shitton of money.  Years ago after several years of savings and investments, I had a 70K account. I yolo'd all into barely out of the money calls on a stock I thought had dipped for unjustified reasons.  I was right and would have made money, but I paper handed out and instead ended up losing 40K of my bankroll.  It was devastating.  That was years of gains gone in less than a day.  I put down trading for 6 months or a year and thought my dreams of making huge tendies were over.  

I kept saving money and just reading about stocks, derivatives and just financial news in general.  I tossed my 30K into AMZN and NFLX and just let it sit.  

Kept saving and with huge gains from amzn and nflx all of a sudden, I had 400K 6 years ago.  Some more trades here and there and now I'm at 2.5 million only 4 years later (it would have been way more had I been more aggressive in my positions.  I'd call my trading style mostly retarded with a significant dash of boomer caution).  

Don't ever give up.  If you take a loss, you are just paying the market.  Losses may seem extreme but remember - I went down to 30K, invested in a boomeresqe manner and made it up to 2.5M in just over 10 years.  You can do that too - especially with all these financial crisis and inflation bubbles all over the place.

Finally REMEMBER!  Most people are not even aware of the stock market as an out to the bad aspects of their life.  They just think it goes up 8% a year and discount that as not being enough to really impact their life when in fact, it is one of the few ways Plebs like us can get a piece of the pie.  If your attempt at doing that fails, then you are just back where you were, working your job like 95% of your co-workers who have their money in mutual funds.  I really encourage you to look into the average NW by age of people.  You just need to deal with the grief of losing that money.",1,0,1615134384,SortedChaos
