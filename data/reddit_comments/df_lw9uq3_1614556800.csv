6,gpg3obg,I hate myself for ðŸ§»ðŸ¤² 2x 3/5 $24c for a measly $1600 profit. Why would i think a 650% gain was good enough. Hopefully my lone 4/9 $24c can continue to print.,5,0,1614712435,Senor_Cangrejos

20,gpg6k0t,"it's a mortgage company , and it is overvalued . It's not GME , with GME menagement and large share holders did not sell their shares( at the time not allowed by SEC)  Unlike  RKT management which  can  sell their shares,  so you sort of help rich getting richer ... RKT will not go beyond $60 and mostlikely drop under $20 in 1-2 days .",3,0,1614713666,Substantial_Bath3369
21,gpg7be9, gamma squeeze today if it closes above 36? or shorts still have until friday to drive the price to below 36,3,0,1614713996,ortseam98
22,gpg7ei8,Assuming that its a mortgage co only... who cares its still undervalued. PE 13 makes it worth 50. Its below that. I love GME but its a casino bcs the company is loosing money it has a negative Earnings and a PE 0... sorry. Not the same.,2,0,1614714032,Relondono
23,gpg7f9u,correct.  And if it gamma squeezes htere are 03/19 options still up to 50 so can move more!,2,0,1614714041,Fun_Paleontologist_2

27,gpg985q,"Haha I'm just messing man, I'm also in the process of forming my diamond hands. But only for certain cases. I'd rather be a paper hands than chase paper the rest of my life.

Sold two of my RKT calls today: $123 &gt;&gt; ~$1200

I have one more call and I'm still in GME just in case. Mostly happy to have found this sub knowing I can make more good plays in the future",2,0,1614714820,n-Ro
