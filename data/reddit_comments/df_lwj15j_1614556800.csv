0,gphnt46,That‚Äôs why tesla and other high growth names have been dumping when bond yields go up. They are the first to get the multiple compression since their p/es are so high. As the yields go higher it‚Äôll start to affect more growth companies with lower p/es in the 30-40s,15,0,1614738956,Throwawayyyyy37

3,gpho5hc,Yeah no way to stop the inflation unless you raise interest rates which would still cause multiple compression. The way I see it we‚Äôre having this compression Either way. We are already starting to see it in the really high growth names like tesla(1200 p/e) nndm(250 p/b)ect. for most companies it‚Äôll just be short term(couple quarters I think)  until the inflation hits the bottom lines then the p/es will reset and we will have plenty of room to compete with bonds like in 2020,5,0,1614739135,Throwawayyyyy37

If you sell something for a set percentage profit, that percentage is the same whether you go from selling something for $100 vs $105 after inflation increases? $100 and $105 being the same adjusted dollar amount due to a made up inflation rate.

8,gphojwj,Shorting TLT which tracks 20 year treasuries. When tlt goes down yields are going up. But I didn‚Äôt do that I‚Äôm just a little over 100% hedged with UVXY &amp; TZA so if the markets fall 50% I‚Äôll make 55-65% so that I don‚Äôt lose money. I don‚Äôt expect a 50% drop btw that‚Äôs just an example. Maybe 20%-25% to around 30 p/e ratio for spy. Idk maybe we could go down 10% and go sideways until the inflation hits but I don‚Äôt see us trending flat for months,7,0,1614739344,Throwawayyyyy37

12,gphpsxt,Yes that‚Äôs why its sort of short/mid term until the inflation hits the bottom lines of the companies. There‚Äôs also a lot of companies that don‚Äôt have enough operating leverage to raise prices as fast as their costs go up making their margins thinner for awhile. It‚Äôs hard for laymen and beginners to understand why inflation would make some stocks go down and some up but it gets simple to grasp once you learn about it,2,0,1614739999,Throwawayyyyy37

19,gphs0s4,Lol if you read my post I‚Äôm not predicting some economy collapse just a short term p/e reset like we had numerous times in history. If you knew basic economics at all you would understand. Watch any freaking cnbc/financial news video with experts right now. Look at the people saying the same thing I‚Äôm saying. The funds are saying they are rotating to value and expecting multiple compression. Then there‚Äôs people like you in the comments that are rude just because they‚Äôre too ignorant to know what they just watched.

21,gpht2r6,"proves you don‚Äôt know that the velocity of money is at an all time low. People aren‚Äôt spending money right now they are saving it. Studies revealed that Most of the stimulus checks have went into savings accounts not the markets. I agree with the accessibility but that‚Äôs already priced in with one of the greatest bull runs of all time. Wsb might be able to keep a couple stocks up but not the whole market. The bond market is multiples bigger than the equity market. No amount of retail traders can stop compression if bonds went high enough. In the U.S. alone, bond markets make up almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market. Trading volume in bonds also dramatically exceeds stock market volume, with nearly $700 billion in bonds traded on a daily basis. Over 90% of investor dollars since 2001 have gone to bonds instead of stocks",1,0,1614741616,Throwawayyyyy37

32,gpi1lb7,Ah yeah it was old data thanks for the updated numbersüëç. Idk why google pulled up those numbers when I went to double check.

Bonds are still bigger they just both grew as our economy did and it seems like equities caught up a little. That 90% thing is up to date though,3,0,1614746423,Throwawayyyyy37
33,gpi4r13,"TL;DR version. 

Inflation creeping back up leads to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates leads to lower demand for stocks and property. Lower demand means you might end up bagholding your stonks while the market adjusts.

As long as inflation stays below 3% or so, nothing noticable will likely happen. But if there is a sudden rise, boomers will cash out for boring/safe assets before you can finish eating you pack of crayons.",6,0,1614748437,Lord_Timujin
