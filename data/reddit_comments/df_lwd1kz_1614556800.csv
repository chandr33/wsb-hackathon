5,gpgp310,If your first time investor I suggest that you read and do some research for a few months like I did first. I started on apps like stash and Robinhood so i could learn. Once I understood the market more I started using my Fidelity account. Stocks like AMC and GameStop are risky they go up and down with a Lotta hype from this page as well. I would be careful putting money into the stocks unless youâ€™re trying to have some fun and screw out the big shots. I personally put all my money into a Roth IRA for my money is safer and i invest in long term stocks like Telsa and Esports Entertainment.,1,0,1614721587,THE_IRAQI_HOBO
