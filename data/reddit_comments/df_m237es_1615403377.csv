21,gqhbmp3,"Sure.  Its a very volatile stock.  If you set stop losses then this is the risk you take, just like if you set sell limits. It can also save your ass too, so risk reward. 

As far as retail's ability to sell- if you set a sell order during a halt it is immediately executed once trading resumes at your sell order price.  

If you, as a random example, placed a sell order at 198 during a halt, even if the stock immediately rebounds to 210 your stock will be sold at 198.",1,0,1615403382,RadicalShift14

54,gqhbnau,"Look up a wash sale. Not super knowledgeable on this so please do more research but let me try to explain as far as my understanding - so usually when you sell a stock at a loss, you can write up X amount in your taxes. I wanna say you can lose up to 3k and write it off as a loss come tax season. So you get some of that money back. But, if you sell at a loss and then buy the same stock within 30 days, you have a wash sale which basically means you can no longer claim your previous losses on your taxes. So I believe fidelity factors that into your cost basis. Like you bought at 240 but since it‚Äôs a wash, your really losing more money because you no longer write off your previous losses, so it averaged out to be $279. Google wash sale fidelity

Also you can tell if it‚Äôs a wash sale if there is a W icon next to your shares",1,0,1615403389,G2chainz
