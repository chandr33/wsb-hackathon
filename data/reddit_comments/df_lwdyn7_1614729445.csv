57,gph8c86,"She worked for McDonald's in 95-97. If he was trying to hint at her specifically he'd have probably done something related to her previous 11 years at BP before her Frog work.

But you could be right. Still it's quite a stretch and honestly it's such a stretch I'd wonder why he'd even bother with hinting about it.

I'm thinking it's something a bit more benign. 

Like, McDonald's is known for never having their ice cream machines working because it's a PITA for the workers to clean so being able to actually get ice cream at McDonald's is basically impossible.

In the same way, GameStop is kinda known for several negative things akin to the infamy of the unavailable McDonald's ice cream (bad prices on trade-ins, pushy membership, never having new releases unless you preordered them). 

The frog emoji is simply glee/happiness, coupled with the McDonald's ice cream is him saying ""If I were in charge of McDonald's, people would be able to get their ice cream, so I'll similarly improve GameStop's most memed shortcomings""",6,0,1614730973,MontyAtWork
