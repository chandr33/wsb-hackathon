15,gpkyp04,"Since we’re making moves into cyclicals, might I suggest SPG. Mall traffic has picked up big time according to Placer.Ai and Simon Property Group is the strongest mall operator in the world. The pandemic shut down most of its competitors and it went on a buying spree purchasing them and stores like Lucky Brand and Forever 21. States and businesses are opening. Pent up demand makes people want to go out and have fun with friends. Simon malls are luxury malls offering more than just stores. They have food, theaters (like AMC), and essential businesses like Target. It’s trading at a discount still compared to other companies that benefitted from the pandemic.",3,0,1614807511,blaclaureate

I got in gme @ 300, averaged to 150 and sold at 103.  Could have sold at 170 but paper hands got the best of me and I couldn't take the fall anymore. 

But since this is my ""gambling"" money managed to make almost 40% back today
I'll go back to gme at 50-60 if it falls again
