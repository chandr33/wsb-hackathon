77,gplaos8,"There's definitely action they could take to bump their share price. No doubt.

I'd argue that it's probably not fully priced in. Index additions / removals rarely are, the same way that the end of lock-up periods rarely get fully priced in. Everyone knows it's going to happen, but when the selling (or buying, in the case of an index addition) actually starts, it usually creates a lot of movement.

Heck, look how much TSLA pumped on the news of its S&amp;P addition, and how much further it rallied once it actually happened and all the indexes had to buy.
