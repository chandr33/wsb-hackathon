6,gqjfmlb,"standards of a quality thread.
not quite getting you there

what you post should be accurate ( with sources to verify)

but quality or click bait that's the thing advertising
vs informative
I'd choose the latter",0,0,1615441787,XSOUL_1337

there is fantastic DD, and the groundwork thesis has already been done. now it's just delta observations as the major moves happen. rest of the time if it's filled with memes wgaf",0,0,1615442064,nomad80

13,gqjgmzd,"no, not since yesterday",0,0,1615442372,XSOUL_1337
14,gqjgn34,I agree totally. It seems like there is hardly any content around here anymore. And now the memes are all remixes of the same format. It‚Äôs always some video from a movie with added subtitles. The influx of new users has led to some incredibly stale content imo meme wise and a bunch of r/investing type DD and ‚Äúyolos‚Äù that is just buying a few shares. OG wsb made me more money last year than I did at my day job after taxes. The solid dd is evaporating.,1,0,1615442374,ashed
15,gqjh0xx,"the issue isn't with the human moderators

it's with the aggressive bots as obviously working on analytics not anything else so if you wanted to get a post theou all you need to do is up vote with alt account's

but I think the boys are restricting more then just garbage, I'd bet their are alof of DD never published not because their wrong just because they didn't get enough up votes with in a time frame

38,gqk56qc,Most the garbage being posted all the time could be comments on the daily thread. I‚Äôm glad all the low effort bullshit is being deleted.

42,gqk6z7o,Yes. Because auto mod is removing a lot of the chaff and those awake and online now are probably just commenting or browsing.
