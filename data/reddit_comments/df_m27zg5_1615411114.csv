0,gqhts9w,UHM yes. Did you see the chart?,1,0,1615411115,WezGunz
1,gqhts8y,"# People. Literally fucking chill with the FUD.

We're still up on the day, and we're up almost 110% this week. The rise has been pretty steady, and you have to keep in mind that they borrowed an absolute shit ton of shares today. They don't have to immediately short their shares once they borrow them, so they can build up their supply in order to hit us with huge price drops when the price goes too high for their comfort.

The price was rising very rapidly today, up to around $350, and they decided to pull out all the stops and stifle what they could, but the massive amount of buy-ins on the dip put the price back above where we left off yesterday and up 8% from where today started. If you zoom the chart out, it looks like a staircase. Huge spike, light cooldown followed by sideways trading, then repeat. This is bullish as fuck, and today was the first time we broke that cycle to this extent. As far as I'm concerned, we're doing great.

All these FUD comments are honestly pretty sad, and the real ones here know what's up.

Not financial advice, but stop whining and look at the past few days, then *try* to tell me it's over.

Also, FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. The definitions for these terms are out there; if you're new here, you need to read the DD before spending your money or you'll risk inheriting paper hands.",324,1,1615411115,Endvisible
