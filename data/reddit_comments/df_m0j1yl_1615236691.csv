0,gq95or2,"&gt; Lets take a worst case scenario. Disney, Paramount and everyone else in the world says 'go screw yourself"" to AMC. They get no new movies. Ever again.

If this occurred, why would AMC be allowed to show their moves ever again, old or new? Does AMC hold some kind of perpetual license to show historical catalog? What film distribution company would ever allow this?",0,0,1615236846,EinGuy
