22,gphmfz9,"His situation wasn‚Äôt exactly dividend related though so I‚Äôll explain a different hypothetical. Let‚Äôs say a stock is at $10 and you are bullish. You want to leverage on the return with little upfront capital so you open a  bull split strike position you selling 100 $9 puts for $1000 and using that $1000 to buy $20 calls. Now you‚Äôve agreed to buy 100 shares at 9 and have the right to buy at $20, giving you long exposure to the stock and the only cash you‚Äôve put up is your margin account. 

Fart forward to ex dividend date, a hedgie has decided he wants the $1 dividend without any price exposure to the stock, so he has constructed a stock + option position that lets him be an owner of record on the dividend date where his options offset any price moves in the stock. Even if the stock has risen a bit to $12 , unwinding his position might involve exercising the puts you sold him, forcing you to pay $90,000 for 100 shares (remember he is price agnostic so doesn‚Äôt care why price the shares are). Ordinarily this would be great since you are getting the shares for below market, but you don‚Äôt have the cash in your account to settle the trade, so the broker liquidates your holdings to cover the cost, only the calls you bought haven‚Äôt appreciated enough to cover it all so now you must come up with the remainder (say $70k) to settle before you can unwind your position. Meanwhile you are exposed to price moves in the stock but restricted from trading due to your large liability on your account. By the time you are able to sell the shares you‚Äôve bought they might not be worth enough, and you don‚Äôt have the option to HODL for a rebound since you have to settle up with your broker. Apologies for any errors, please let me know if I‚Äôve screwed up something, just my understanding of a possible situation.",2,0,1614738253,wished345678743
