I have never seen a stock so easily buck a dip like GME did today which is a credit to all of the apes holding strong and not panic selling.

48,gqhtp1h,"Personally, I was convinced that the big money had done the smart thing and secured a long position, cover shorts and options exercised along the way, and they would be able to cover losses over time. It seemed like the only way to ensure they win and retail investors lose by making us the bag holders once they hit their break-even point and crash the stock. But, after today's blatant manipulation on a large stock with no news, it's clear that there is BIG money and it is DESPERATE. It's also clear that in today's desperation, there was an abject failure. The $350 gain was essentially wiped away, but all that does is delay us a day. If they had ammo to run the stock down, why not do it when it's trading at $50, when sentiment was low, when smart larger investors can't see how this thing just prints money? Why now, what was important about today that wouldn't be just as true and easier to have done 2 weeks ago?",48,0,1615411075,GroundhogExpert
