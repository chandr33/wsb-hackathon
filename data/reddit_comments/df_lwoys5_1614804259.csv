Let me put it this way, rather than saying what you don't like, what do you *want* them to do? Because just letting users do whatever they want isn't reasonable and that would only ruin the sub more.

Just doing whatever the GME crowd wants all the time isn't reasonable either, especially when they do shit like downvote megathreads for other stocks all the way to 0. So that *definitely* isn't an option.

Can I offer some suggestions that are truly coming from a place of concern?

1) get enough sleep. The market will move, it is not under your control, so sleep at least 6 hours per 24hrs.

2) hydrate. Drink water, or sports drinks, milk etc... staying hydrated keeps the brain functioning. Also you will be less likely to cramp up while you are craning your neck to keep a constant eye on your stonks.

3) if nothing works to calm your nerves, get high. Cannabis is pretty safe, but maybe your doctor can recommend something that has easier dosage control. But....STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM AMBIEN!",1,0,1614805684,G_yebba

We’re in a war where the ammunition is money and shorts must cover while so many ITM calls still remain for the next few weeks on the GME option chain. This is far from over if we are even half right about the current short interest.

We have leverage because we like to stock and we have a hunch a lot of billionaires needs GME to go bankrupt so they don’t have to cover their short positions. 

We are taking a calculated risk for huge upside. Someone used shorting as a bludgeoning tool to destroy GME and now the market is correcting their mistake with a mega gamma squeeze!
