4,gqan4tk,My dad never wore a coat except when we would go to the movies so we could sneak in candy. So one day when he picked me up from school with his coat in the car I immediately asked him what movie we were seeing. Fellowship of the ring. That was lit,5,0,1615264951,orzechj

19,gqanupd,"Jurassic Park, my childhood friends and I got tickets to see it on a Saturday for one of their birthday's, after a day of us hanging out at their place playing videogames and goofing off outside in the woods until showtime. The movie theater sat on the bottom of this hill where the rest of the town was, which was fun to bike to, and I think it was the first movie I had seen with a packed theater. Whole movie blew our minds and we spent the rest of the day, night, and some of the rest of the week and summer talking about the movie. Jurassic Park still holds up today.",2,0,1615265424,Skullpt-Art

21,gqao2xb,"I went to see Shrek 2 with my young autistic cousin back in the day. Wanted to give him a good time so I brought a whole watermelon into the theatre and I used a plastic knife to cut it up and we ate the whole thing together. He was on top of the world that day. We walked out of that New Jersey AMC as kings, clothes completely dyed red with watermelon juice. All these years later he still brings it up almost every time I see him.",3,0,1615265575,Ill_Standard6727

24,gqaq8j6,"I vaguely remember everyone crying at Lion King

The biggest was probably the only time my parents took me to see a movie together and it was Batman Forever I was young and a Batman fanatic, and shit I guess I was 4 then lol lots of neon and Kiss from a Rose

I remember the first Pokemon movie was all kinds of hype with the “blue pikachu” before the 2nd gen dropped",2,0,1615267035,Motorbreath91
