Possible shill account: not a lot of karma and a very new user.

10,gpkzr2f,"GEVO is one of my favorite babes.    
It was recently hit in a valuation, based on past performance. The jest was GEVO has $ but will fail putting them to good use because 10 years ago failed to use its cash properly.    
   
However now, itâ€™s active (with agreements, news, etc). Needs to go ahead and do that mega factory they promised. IF they do that, theyâ€™ll gain fundsâ€™ confidence and will moon.    
    
A good catalyst would be gaining a piece of the incentives for low/zero carbon - remains to be seen if only oils will get that.",5,0,1614807974,CurveAhead69

12,gpl0c9l,Back in august it was selling for .55. It ran starting December 23 and peeked at 14.86 on the 10th it currently isn't looking like it's downward is slowing down enough. the last 3 days it held around close before falling again...lets see when it gets some stability first if ever. I see it going to around $5 then slowly falling to $3 over the rest of the year...If they get some good deals and green energy ACTUALLY gets pushed then it could be a good buy at $5ish,1,0,1614808234,cyrosgold
