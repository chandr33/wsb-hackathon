1,gpfnqx8,"Still holding my GME shares strong too, but I sold my remaining stocks from my cash account and YOLO'd into RKT. I figure if RKT tanks before the special one-time dividend, I can sell to maximize my gains on the way down, then buy even more back the next day to get a cut of that nice $1.11/share dividend.",2,0,1614705576,GhostOfSamurai

3,gpfnrbz,"95% is held internally. ETFs are picking up scraps of the other 5% which is possibly why shorts have held it down for this long. So that if RKT sells the remaining 95% stake they can scoop it up cheap.

You can probably sell and roll into 3/12 calls if you think it'll go up or just buy shares with money as that would increase more short term. 

Your calls won't go higher cause the volatility is getting priced in and it'll need to increase bigly for it to go up more.",1,0,1614705585,Ultimate_Broseph
