17,gqdux1i,"Yeah, basically it's a version of the expected utility theory. Straight from the guy that proposed it:

&gt; The determination of the value of an item must not be based on the price, but rather on the utility it yields ... There is no doubt that a gain of one thousand ducats is more significant to the pauper than to a rich man though both gain the same amount.

What he's saying there can also apply to this case. Let's imagine a hypothetical person to whom losing 1000 dollars is not life changing but winning 10k is, for that person 10k could be worth more than 10 times 1000 in which case, that bet would be smart even if there's a 10% chance of success*, though mathematics says that it's neither good nor bad. Same as a 50-50 of losing your house or getting a new one: losing a house is way worse than getting a second home is good, so it's a stupid bet.

I use that theory to decide my risk level and I think others should too, though not knowing the exact odds (unlike with, for example, a roulette table) means the calculations involve way more guesswork than the simplified example I gave earlier.

IMPORTANT! There is no “official FINRA” short report

Huge misconception I’m seeing is that the information that you see on FINRA-markets.Morningstar.com is an “official FINRA” short report. It’s not. It’s just FINRA’s link to Morningstar which doesn’t always have accurate data. The info is NOT official and does NOT come from FINRA. 
Why is this important? Morningstar has the wrong float on 2 stocks you may have heard of- AMC and GME. They have the GME float as 27M shares (??) it’s 54M. They have AMC float as 285M it’s 400M. 

Most websites have stale float for AMC because they issued a ton of shares in Jan and they’re not accounting for Silver Lake conversion. Morningstar doesn’t include any insider or company that owns more than 10% of share in the float calc which is just...wrong? Fido’s shares def should have been in float. For example look at MarketWatch. They have the float as 54M. A lot of confusion about “what is the real short interest” doesn’t stem from “what are the total shares short” it stems from “what is the float?”

**TL; DR** FINRA does NOT have an official short interest report. NYSE and NASDAQ separately report SI. NASDAQ is available to public online. NYSE is available for a fee. Info on that page is from a 3rd party provider- Morningstar, which isn’t 100% accurate. Bloomberg gets the SI from the exchanges and people can already see it. You don’t have to wait haha. 

(Also- I don’t think it even matters! If enough people think the stock has high short interest it will trade that way. Last SI report saw GME short decline again and that day the stock started its second moon)

93,gqe4li5,"Thank you for sharing.  I wanted to challenge OP's (Verb0182) DD regarding the matter:

I truly believe that majority of the shorts did not cover their position.  Like you mentioned, the OG S.I. was at 120% at one point; in which, I want to further my point on that.  If shorts were to cover, then that means the price would have to drive up continuously even if people were paper handing at the top.  OP mentioned they cover immediately on the next trade; however, I find it true if that were to be the case only if people were selling.  Example:  Assuming that if there was a buyer and the price goes up, is the Short Seller going to buy back at a higher value if the value goes up?  OP is assuming that the Value of the stock immediately drops and is able to buy back at a lower value (Sell at ""$108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791"").  If the value rises, then the Short Sellers are left holding the bag until it drops back down to ""$108.791"".  Please keep in mind, real-time trading is occurring  through every direction and hedges as well as retails are always trying to buy in and/or day trade.  And if people were diamond handing, how can they even cover their positions of nearly 100% (120% to 22% according to FINRA (or FINTEL? I forgot) when 100% would mean the TOTAL GME FLOAT.  In order to cover, you need to return the share back to the original person who loaned out the share to you in the first place which means that by buying back the shares should have continued ramping up the value anyways.

In my opinion, the restriction that occurred in late Jan was to stop people from FOMO'ing in order to reduce and/or mitigate risks as well as their efforts for damage control.  I am assuming Hedges even opened up Short positions at the TOP as well meaning that the short positions may still be in the same ball park or a little less but not -100%.  Keep in mind, even at our LOWEST of 40$ that has been trading on a downtrend for weeks.  How is it that ""shorts covered"" when the value was going down.  I do not find that logical unless someone can literally show me DATA that proves otherwise.

**TLDR:**  In my opinion, Shorts did not cover because it does not make any logical sense.  OP's theory of selling and buying right away only works if it was on the down tick but even then.... Hedges and Retail Investors were buying and/or day trading to fluctuate the value so they could possibly be left with the bag in the first place.Covering short positions = buying and then returning it back to the original party that loaned it to you.  This should indicate the value of the stock to increase or stabilize if they were to cover.  120% S.I. in January down to around 22% according to FINRA or FINTEL, really?   This is why DIAMOND HANDS is so important.  100% = all of GME's float.

96,gqe4w1a,Sorry some or many hedge funds/ algos are buying huge amounts of call options every day. Which makes dealers by stock to hedge. Which makes the price go higher. Which makes them buy more stock. Also there’s a bunch of free/ paid for alerts now. So you see “$500K GME 04/16/21 500c bought” and people go “ooh! The price is going up!” Or “ooh! Someone knows something!” And it becomes kind of a circular self fulfilling prophecy,2,0,1615335868,Verb0182
97,gqe4zkl,"Oh yeah, understood, thanks. I guess there's no second squeeze then as HFs aren't dumb enough to do the same play again with all eyes on GME. (I also don't see how the ""synthetic shorts"" in ETFs really matter)

So is GME's ascent so far purely just based on momentum/speculation? I really don't know what to peg its short interest as anymore.",1,0,1615335918,_Duality_

Amen.",1,0,1615335989,actraiser2
99,gqe5c6i,"Yes. Purely momentum/ speculation. In *some* ways it makes it even more sustainable than a short squeeze though right? Short squeeze- people cover, it’s over. This- I have zero clue what makes the music stop.",1,0,1615336106,Verb0182
