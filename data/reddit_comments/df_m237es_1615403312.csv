1,gqhbgr6,I agree there is some manipulation going on but this sub has been talking about roblox ever since they announced that they'd be going public. It just so happened that shorts start covering a shitload of shares on the same day. Maybe they been eyeing the sub and wanted to use it as a distraction.  üòÇ,2,0,1615403313,seasport100

No way of proving this on my part, I'm actually fucking retarded.

59,gqhbhud,"Disclaimer : I am not very experienced. If you assume the order book is identical on the way up and on the way down, rebuying the shorted shares will reincrease the price in the same proportion selling them decreased it. So you need to change the structure of the order book for that kind of move to be profitable, that is you must manage to make it drop so violently/so plausibly that other market participants will go from bullish to bearish and begin to sell as well. Thus, the shorter can buy those fresh shares at a discount, because now investors are bearish and want to close their position. If a shorter does not manage to sway the investors, some of the shares he sold were bought by bullish investors who are not willing to part from them. So now the shorter has to pay a premium on the way back up.

So a short attack is a two step move :

\- step 1 : lower the price

\- step 2 : change the outlook of investors

Step 1 is guaranteed, and step 2 determines whetherthe attack is successful or not. This is why some in this thread described this as ""psychological warfare""",2,0,1615403325,blipblapbloopblip

my personal theory is the gamma squeeze is gonna be activated around 350, my reasoning being that it was just under that before the massive selloff.
