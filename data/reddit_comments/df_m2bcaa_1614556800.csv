20,gqia0o7,"I understand if stocks followed suit, but what would make it all start at 12:17? That was something setting it off at that specific time, not just stocks reacting to a sell off in one ticker or even a few tickers (unless someone can find me a crash in a prominent stock for a few minutes or even 1 minute earlier than this).  And the fact that, even if it was just a massive computerized sell of hundreds of tickers at once, potentially a single entity can sway the entire market like this is wild and terrifying. And if it wasn't a single entity... then now way it's legal. Right?",3,0,1615418675,InevitableRhubarb232
21,gqiajbt,This is not court. This is casino. If you want to dig deep try searching for a credit suisse report for some 5-10 yrs ago that documents how spy started selling at some specific time and other stocks follows. You also need to go back and check 5000+ stocks &amp; etfs to check when &amp; where exactly the trigger was placed. Then you need to read up momentum ignition algos and understand that momentum goes both ways. Or just ignore this post and press buy gme,7,0,1615418935,deep3bat

The cleaning lady was extremely meticulous with her Covid-19 disinfection protocol. So, she accidentally activated the saved sell orders worth billions of $$$ in various stocks the analyst was responsible for. The analyst came back to his office 20 minutes later and turned his monitor on to be welcomed by a meltdown in the stocks that he was responsible for.
