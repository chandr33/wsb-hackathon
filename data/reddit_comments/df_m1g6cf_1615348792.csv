1,gqesip5,"Yeah, I read the DD from Uberkikz nearly 6 months ago that said he thought it could reach $100 and he is as real as it gets.  There was also a fascinating conversation in mid January between uberkikz and Shkreli where they talk about the fair market value for a turnaround story like this.  Shkreli, who has done this before and who has also executed a short squeeze of his own, made a case for $4Billion all day, but nothing more, as it is at the end of the day a difficult turnaround, and that price would allow him some room to actually make money if he got it right.  Uber of course thought $100 or roughly $10 Bil was still reasonable.  It was a thoughtful exchange.

Nobody anywhere has made the case that even if this goes flawlessly,would it be worth more than that.  The current price is way above and beyond any possible justification other than ‚Äúwe are successfully manipulating it so it can only go up‚Äù

You have to factor in a flawless turnaround to value the business positively right now.  The legacy business, left as-is, was failing.   They were going to have to liquidate what little assets they had to remain a going concern.  If not for the Ryan Cohen angle, there‚Äôs no value whatsoever.",1,0,1615348796,OlyBomaye

41,gqesn3c,"What i heard is that usually something will list as superhigh because of instituional interest, and then legit just plummet within the day or couple days until it reaches like a reasonable price. So if somehow u can get in literally right before takeoff and then sell before it crashes u can make good moneys but not otherwise. There's a couple stocks u can see this happen, many where it never has even reached the All time high of the first week listing. Idk if RBLX puts would be good to do until it reaches reasonable price. Other people are a lot smarter than me on this btw this is just what i've read. Still, if it doesn't list crazy high, it still has lots of potential to be a really good growth stock",1,0,1615348870,pornispoison59
