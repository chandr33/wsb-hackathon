From [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASO) and [stockrow](https://stockrow.com/ASO) both have D/E at 1.45. Looking at the balance sheet, Total Debt is 1409 and Total Equity is 985 making D/E 1.43. Where did you get 272%?",1,0,1615240659,MrMineHeads

7,gqcf6hp,"You made excellent points. Backed it up with excellent data. Presented it flawlessly. And linked all pertinent information you used. After looking in and doing my own DD, I find you largely ACCURATE. I'm in. WSB will remember DFV and XionTG. Picked up a couple of options on a spread. Good luck to all. See you on Centauri.",2,0,1615307691,Anothercluelesshuman

11,gqlixws,"I mean did you even take the time to look at my price targets and dates? It’s still March... my first price target isn’t until May. And it’s only been 8 days since I posted this DD—I am not day trading this, this is a longer term play for me. Also if you do some quick TA, you’ll notice that it is still in the channel that it has been in since day 1, so I expect it to bounce back just like it did last week and as it has done in the past.",1,0,1615485747,XionTG
12,gqlx0rd,"I would also like to point out that they have a HUGE Team Sports business along with Apparel, which will be good when everything starts to reopen.

If you’ve never heard of Academy, the best example I comparison is thinking of them as a more discounted Dicks Sporting Goods.

I used to work at Academy back in high school, so trust me guys.  I know what I’m talking about.  I’m super cereal.",2,0,1615491818,Tio-Vinnito
13,gqri9zp,"Alright what are you thinking?  I've done my own DD and read every recent DD I could find.  A little preoccupied with some other stuff to look into it too much.  My opinion is below but don't read it until you state years, yeah?

&gt;!Hampered by the weekly rotation back into tech.  Reddit is often right, but often too early.  The last two days of support has been nice, despite several discouraging days.  Still has good upside in the next 30-60 days.  Also, the low volatility might prove to be a real good thing in the next year.!&lt;",1,0,1615605325,MortalDanger00
