They are not market manipulation or a hedge fund pressing a button. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.",12,0,1615399139,RutabegaSuede
