2,gpkdfz2,"RIP apes ended up spending the entire day in the RKT thread shitting on it. You can literally scroll back to the opening of the thread and see it. Literally took one slight dip and the narrative of ""pump and dump' was achieved and the FUD built up from there. I said it before but its actually so sad to see other retail investors down vote and spend all day shitting on other retail investors just because it isn't the stock play they have going on.",3,0,1614798315,20Log

Second don‚Äôt talk about him as if you know what his moral compass is, The decisions he makes our zero heart and all ball sack and rightfully so if you were the ceoAnd you knew your company was about to go tits up what would you do? It‚Äôs not necessarily a ploy to pull Tards Off of GME But it certainly was a distraction.

But I do agree with you that Just because a stock is shorted doesn‚Äôt mean The guy who runs the bank in despicable me is sitting there with a computer and a mountain of blow going thumbs up or thumbs down to every single stock that comes across the screen.  They could have a outdated business model, there Could be regulation that‚Äôs going to change there ability to gain capital, The market could be soft on their products and services, Or in the case of rocket their space is oversaturated and they‚Äôre not as competitive as other offerings.
