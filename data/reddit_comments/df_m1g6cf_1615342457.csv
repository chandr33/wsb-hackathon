7,gqeh8vu,"Not many ways to lose with APHA. Only thing that could happen is if the merger doesn't happen. But I don't think that's likely, but what the fuck do I know. 

Merger happens, TLRY goes up a bunch, sell after merger. 

APHA gets hyped up a shit ton before the merger, sell. 

Merger happens, TLRY comes down to APHA, sell. 

With all three of those options you either make money or break even if you time the sells right imo",1,0,1615342462,redrocketinn

11,gqeh9af,Word thank you. Days Gone looks great,2,0,1615342468,trol_de_rol
12,gqeh9cl,"If you hold a call and it hits the expiration day, the call expires worthless. 

Yeah, so I sold the 2 to buy 3. But the 2 I sold were at a way lower strike price. 

I had 160cs. If you had a 160c expiring today and GME was trading at 260, it'd be worth 260 - 160 = 100 per share.

If you had a 260c expiring today and GME was trading at 260, it'd be worth nothing. 260 - 260 = 0.

So when you hold a higher strike call, you need the stock to go higher. But if it does, those calls were much cheaper, so your profits are bigger.

I traded my 2 calls which were worth a lot for 3 calls worth less, plus some other stuff. If GME moons to 420.69, then the 3 cheaper OTM calls will become worth more than the 2 expensive, ITM calls.",2,0,1615342469,commentingrobot
