47,gqf4qq5,"There are 9 million people in the sub and you might see 100 screenshots of legit solid 'nailed it' gains on any given day.  About as much, if not more, loss porn.

That said, every single thing you see is something to learn from.  You might miss a run, but the chart's there, old comments are there, and when you see someone posting gains, you can absolutely be that person on some future thing if you're in the right place at the right time.

People say 'don't FOMO' but a lot of things you can jump in a little late and play the momentum, the more you look back at past run-ups and pops the more you'll look at future things and more accurately determine if it's going to continue to go up.  If you throw your money into something before it pops it's just a dud, and if you throw money into something that falling (contrarian, catching a knife) you'll be on the bad side of the trade right off the bat because it's dropping, but if you buy into momentum, generally, you'll be in the green within seconds and it makes exiting a little easier and less painful.

I think the biggest rookie mistake is to buy into things that aren't even trending in the right direction in hopes that will be the next big thing and to avoid buying into momentum out of fear that it'll instantly reverse.  Spend some time watching some of these trains and eventually get that IDGAF confidence and try throwing some money you don't worry about losing at one and get out at a small profit, even if it's 5 minutes later, get a feel for jumping into momentum and identifying when it might be too late.",1,0,1615357363,Bcron
