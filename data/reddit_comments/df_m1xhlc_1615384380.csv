2,gqg179p,Most of the Robinhood users have switched over to somewhere else that won't restrict you. Even those who didn't I doubt Robinhood would be dumb enough to do it again. Premarket is looking very good. Seems like the hedgies went full dumbass and shorted GME to oblivion. We've got a steady incline so big investors aren't afraid of buying in like last time because of how volatile it was. Things are looking quite good.  🐸🍦🚀📈,1,0,1615384382,BatmanDontGiveNoShit

20,gqg1804,"If you plan to buy GME in lots of 100, it makes good sense to purchase LEAPs.

Example:

For GME at $275 this morning, 100 shares costs $27,500.

The price of a deep ITM JAN22/23 leap should be the current share price minus strike price. For example, the $150 LEAP should be about $125 (will probably be more, due to IV but this is a simple example). Total cost to gain exposure to 100 shares will be $12,500, less than half the cost of buying 100 shares outright. Due to delta hedging, MMs are required to hold as many shares as the contract has delta.

If the contract is deep ITM and delta = 100, then MMs hold 100 shares. It's a less expensive way to gain exposure to future price movements, while also contributing to the cause.

Choose strikes that cater to your risk tolerance, and good luck apes.
