8,gpm8a6y,"If they buy calls, they don't have to buy shares to cover, so it's cheaper.  That's the point.  They're not gonna exercise those calls.

It's like buying ITM LEAPS and selling short calls against them.  You don't have to buy the shares to leverage them, you just need the right to buy them.",3,0,1614830751,Rrrrandle

11,gpm8ntg,"Very reasonable but remember that they can still fake the short interest report number by buying far OTM call options such as a strike price of 800. Then they can reported as shorts are covered.
You might be right that they are unable to cover with call options but they can still use OTM call options to fool the public.

By the way, I would try to post a difficult question during the day when there are a lot of very smart people who know this stuff. I am not 100% sure with my answer",21,0,1614830965,SaveAmerica2024

16,gpm9xjw,"Far ITM calls have no IV. It‚Äôs exactly the same as buying shares for them, except they aren‚Äôt the ones pushing the share price up in the process of buying to cover.

22,gpmb2fr,"A 40c has a $83.95 premium. $123.95. 

They can use far OTM calls to hide their positions. They would use far ITM options to exercise for a flat rate of $123.95/share to close the position. 

If they try to close the position by buying actual shares to return, they are pushing the price way up by having to buy at higher and higher Asks",9,0,1614832358,fatedMercy

You‚Äôre totally right that it won‚Äôt take care of the whole thing. If any of them are doing this, they‚Äôre cutting their losses here. Other HFs might think it‚Äôs financially beneficial to hold out hope for right now. 

Either way, people are buying the shares, directly or indirectly through the MM. So the price movement should play out the same either way. It‚Äôs just a matter of what players are footing the biggest bills",3,0,1614835577,fatedMercy
