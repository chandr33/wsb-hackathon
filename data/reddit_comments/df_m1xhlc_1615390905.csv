This is MBMV. I would like you to consider the circle. It is comprised of 360 degrees. I believe it is by no coincidence that there are 365 days in a year. Perhaps our calculations for the circle were wrong.  Perhaps all wreaths and window displays, bridges and fountains, all that is manmade may in fact be off by five degrees. Do you ever feel uncomfortable or anxious? Are we all victims to an error in calculation? Anyways, leave a message at the beep.",1,0,1615390907,sterlingflash
