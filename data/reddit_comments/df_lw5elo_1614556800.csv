There's no doubt in many people's minds that without them restricting purchase of $GME that it would have far exceeded it's high.

That said, there's too many people, myself included, that find it's service simple. More important, because of their growth since the beginning of the pandemic, more people have invested and made a lot of money (mostly because things have only gone up).

Can you short: sure. But Robinhood's stock will go up. Even with the recent exodus too many non-WSB people use it.  Even recent $GME gain porn on WSB show a lot of people still use it.

Do what you want, but if they offer me shares via my Robinhood acct, as long as their reasonably priced I'm going to purchase because at the end their ceo and company are a meme stock too.",1,0,1614701334,Dasky34
