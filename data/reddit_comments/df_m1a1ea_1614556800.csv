10,gqcque1,"UWMC is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 on march 22nd (almost positive that's the date)

Also the CEO of UWMC gave an ""ultimatum"" of you can work with RKT or us but not both, and so far a large number of their business partners have confirmed they will work with UWMC moving forward.

It is also being shorted and I believe being kept down until the russell 1000 and 3000 release so they can profit more once this ""bottoms out"" (which I think is right now)",3,0,1615312451,CaptnZacSparrow
11,gqcr5zd,"Same, but it was 875 for me. 29c @8.75, was up to 41 end of day, but held out for one more day. I knew it would crash, but my red crayon eating ass got greedy. Lesson learned for sure - take the money, retard.",2,0,1615312589,juliocleansanchez
12,gqcres9,Fuckin same. I could of gotten away with a 400 dollar profit and told myself to hold out because the next day would be insane. It was insane. Not the direction i needed. Lmao,2,0,1615312696,Brd1769

21,gqd5cvi,"I sold for a loss when RKT let me down. Then I bought puts and I lost my money so fast all I could do was buy shares. I couldnâ€™t sell my puts  because nobody was buying and I dipped below the margin line very briefly. I bought 3715 at 25.53 and stop listed at 26 something. 

3 grand covered some of my puts. It was such a big jump that they are basically better off being held.",2,0,1615319129,wiserone29
22,gqd6wo3,One thing I have learned with RKT is to always take profit on an option trade before the market closes.,1,0,1615319823,NeeqOne
