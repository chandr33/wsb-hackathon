12,gphig4g,Why do you look to buy a call with the highest strike price? U think it will get over whatever that strike price is?? Just wanted to understand ðŸ¤˜,3,0,1614736183,granshaw-KY
13,gphj040,TD has had up to $60 strikes before market closed.,1,0,1614736474,caliber88
14,gphj7t5,They are usually cheap and you can make a quick short term play if you sell while the stock is running up. Implied volatility inflates the option contract price when there is high volume and large swings. Itâ€™s also why you see weeklies deteriorate in value near the exp date.,9,0,1614736588,Andrew-Wang

18,gphl691,"I am just curious, although after RKT pay the dividend, the stock price will mark down by the price paid ($1.1) automatically. Anyone help me understand other loss HF has?

Besides, today's volume is super super high. And wednesday we may see another peak!",2,0,1614737601,arbitratex

20,gphm433,RKT = Hedgie Punp N Dump.,-5,0,1614738081,Betorox101
21,gphmcv5,"IV - implied volatility. The fact that there's a chance an OTM call goes ITM means that someone will take the gamble. Since RKT was up $20 in a day, it's possible if it does that 3 more times, RKT is $100 per share. So someone may pay a few dollars per contract for a chance at multiplying their money.

Definitely not saying it's going to $100, just using nice easy math to describe why OTM options have value.",2,0,1614738209,Faedro
22,gphn3x7,"It doesnt have to. With the IV you are making anywhere from 4-8 times the gain than the actual stock price. Sometimes even higher. People were making 10 baggers and more buying $800 gme calls. It never came close to that price. 

You just have to remember to sell. As quick as it goes up it can go down. Theta decay is real. Iv is nuts.",4,0,1614738596,muskat2586

25,gphoi04,"It never hit resistance it didnâ€™t overcome until it was halted by a 2 million sell transaction both times. Otherwise, it was fueled to keep shooting up. I donâ€™t see how this is about the chain. Why would people be buying the stock thereby driving the price up only as far up as the options chain would go?",3,0,1614739316,LilRingtone

28,gphvxhn,"You seem like someone with much experience so I have a question if you don't mind. I use ToS/TD and it seems I can't buy options unless I own at least 1 share of the stock I want to buy an option for. From my research, it seems RH allows for the purchase of options for a stock you don't even own. Is this true?",1,0,1614743155,initial8155
