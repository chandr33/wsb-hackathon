86,gqge4x6,"They're not ""buying"" the stocks to hold on to as an investment. When they shorted, it means they borrowed the stock and wrote an ""IOU 1 GME stock"" to the actual owner. (This is also how they borrowed more stocks than exist.) The borrowed socks immediately get sold for their current value (let's say $4) and then when they return the GME stock they borrowed 21 days later, they expected it to drop to $0.04 so they can easily buy it and give it back, making a big profit. Instead, they need to buy the stock they sold at $4 for whatever the diamond hands decide the price is (the moon). They've already used the ""value"" of the stock and now they have to give it back to the actual owner. They can delay but they are bleeding money on interest payments for missing their deadline. They tried to use their media connections and dirty market manipulation tactics to FUD (fear, uncertainty, despair) the stock holders, but WSB is too retarded to react to basic instincts of self-preservation so they still held and there wasn't enough volume to settle all the ""borrowed"" shorts. So now we're finally seeing a squeeze where the hedge funds are finding out just how much a bunch of apes value there games.
