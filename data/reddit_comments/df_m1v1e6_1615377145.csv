3,gqfq64n,"It‚Äôs all about the CPI report today. The consensus forecast is for 1.4% seasonally-adjusted (that‚Äôs YoY) Core CPI for February. That‚Äôs the most important one. There are month-over-month readings as well that will generate some noise, but the YoY gauge is the one to watch.

If it exceeds the target then there will be talk of inflation (and possibly hyperinflation. People like to bring that into the conversation) and more importantly speculation about the Fed needing to normalize rates. This could also prompt another bond sell-off. Stocks could follow, or not. Stocks have been very unpredictable lately, so quite hard to game this.

If the CPI falls short of the target, then that may not be all systems go either. Because this will mean the Fed has to keep rates lower for longer, which means inflation will invariably get worse. Or so the narrative goes. Of course this too could mean hyperinflation is incoming.

Obviously ignore all talk of hyperinflation. Hopefully you know better than that. The key is that the only thing that will ultimately end this bull market is higher rates. So the only thing to really be concerned about is a reading that exceeds the consensus forecast.",1,0,1615377153,The_Contrarian01
