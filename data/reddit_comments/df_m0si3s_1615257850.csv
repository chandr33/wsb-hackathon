But that company has a shit ton of assets and real value.

I'm not saying Gamestop won't be a decent company after all this but it won't hit these ridiculous numbers being spouted. The demand simply isn't there. Even if the shorted stock starts getting bought up, people will sell. This drives down the price as others Bag hold waiting for more shorts to close. That's assuming they all closed at once or even a decent number. Others realize if you wait it out, they pay a paltry few million as the stocks plummet again. All they need to do is buy a few to get y'all excited and dump your shares. They'll short at the top so they won't even lose that money and it is worth it to get people to sell and drop prices again. And we all know the brokers and clearinghouse are not going to margin call the hedge funds this go around. They will smartly let it play out.

99,gqamxoe,"Calls are useful for OTM and non volatile stocks. Due to the volatility and current pricing, you can still buy calls but it will cost you.

The ones you see making that money is from calls purchased long before this and they were much, much cheaper to buy. Last October to mid January. 

You can still make money off them but it'll be far less as strike prices are higher and premiums higher and the return smaller.

This is where real DD comes in on other companies and you make your moves.

If you can afford some puts right now you can make decent cash but it requires you to have some capital. 

A 190p is around $4800 at the moment 3/19. Assume the stock falls you might be able to sell that call ITM for a decent profit. Few thousand, just depends. Say it crashes to 50 bucks. You then buy 100 shares for 5,000. So you paid 9800 total. You exercise the ITM put and someone buys it from you at 190. That's 19000 - 9800 so a nice profit of $9200.

But you needed almost 10k up front to make that. Obviously less if the contract gains value and you simply sell to close for the smaller profit without ever dealing with shares.

Buying a 200c for $4670 means you'll pay someone $24670 before seeing a dime. So you need the stock to hit 250 to make a measly $330. Thats a huge gap to hit in these volatile times. Buying calls now is risky but you can have at it. Risk versus reward seems to suck.

None of this includes broker commission fees which are fairly cheap but also adds to your cost basis.",2,0,1615264826,Qwinntuss
