8,gqec3f7,"Real talk, gamma squeeze could push it up over $800 with sufficient demand. If there is still a short squeeze to squoze (I'm of the mind that there is), that could push it up over $1,000 for a period of time. $5,000; $10,000; $100,000 targets are not going to happen. The government won't let it happen. Shorts won't pay those prices even if that is what we ask them to pay and they have to buy shares. They just won't buy the shares and they'll deal with whatever punishment they are given.",2,0,1615339701,captaincampbell42
