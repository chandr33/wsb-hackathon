52,gphqt2f,"Listen up, retards. An autist is speaking. 

Ann Hand.

First part: Ann. Taken individually that's A, N, and N.

Assigned numbers of the alphabet and that's 1, 14, 14.

In the image, he didn't use periods. Also, the ice cream is on a table. Naturally, that means we look at the periodic table.

In modern IUPAC notation, Group 1 is the alkali metals, which contains hydrogen. Hydrogen bonding is the strongest form of dipole-dipole interaction. Therefore, **A = 1 = hydrogen = strong**

In modern IUPAC notation, Group 14 is the carbon family . What is made of carbon? Think you ape...fucking DIAMONDS! Therefore, **N = 14 = carbon = diamonds**

Second part: Hand. Like ""hands"" but singular.

Put it together and ""Ann Hand"" can only mean the **STRONGEST DOUBLE DIAMOND HANDS**
