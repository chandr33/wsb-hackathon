7,gqbwlj9,"Do you mean this seems slow because you expected a money-printer, or that the EUA process seems slow from the perspective of biomedical business? 

Getting EUA at all is a risky play that happens to be looking promising right now, but it's never been a sure thing regardless of all of the extremely enthusiastic hypemen around here. EUA by end of April is actually extremely fast, considering green-lighting a vaccine from India with no/minimal additional US studies is so out of the norm to begin with.

Not saying this is your personal position, but I really wish people would stop treating this like a pump and dump.",1,0,1615300271,Ballswenbah

15,gqc2f9p,"The US had enough vaccines before J&amp;J and still purchased those. There are several fundamental issues you are missing:.

1) the latest covid relief belief, which is getting  passed this week, contains an additional 14 billion for covid vaccines and distribution. Meaning, they haven't even spent a cent from this new bill yet.

2) the priority always has been getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible. This doesn't happen by buying a set amount for the population and letting it rest.  And considering they've already purchased more than exist adults in the US it's irrelevant. More vaccines also helps alleviate the massive distribution problems they are facing.

3) If they get government funding for manufacturing (say by Merck), Ocugen sort of just takes margin off the top.

4) This vaccine is already tested against the UK strain, and it works. This is important because you may have to take additional boosters of the other vaccines to achieve immunity against strains, which again makes those vaccines logistical nightmares",1,0,1615302793,BDCB5
