1,gqiavrh,This shit is so retarded I don’t know what to say. I guess just gamble it all away. And by that I mean just buy calls and puts that make no logical sense.,6,0,1615419111,Nick_Flippers

6,gqib69q,"Keep in mind that just because a stop loss order is set at $69, there's no guarantee you will get that price if a stock plunges. When the price goes below the limit, your stop loss order turns into a market order and it's possible the price might have dropped further by the time your order gets filled.",5,0,1615419263,PlumpStegadon

12,gqibdx1,Don’t use your dads money unless you’ve been trading for a while and have had a stable run of success. I lost 100% of my money twice(extremely large amounts) before I actually built a strategy into my trading. It’s easy to spend money and lose it all really fast when you’re wrong for a couple days in a row.,3,0,1615419374,TreeHugChamp

18,gqic1os,What the fuck do we know about strategy. We work at Wendy's on minimum wage and turn tricks on the side. Get the fuck out of here with your red preppy CORNELL sweater khakis $25k allowance you cum spitter.,-1,0,1615419715,kde873kd84
19,gqic3ox,"Great example of this is when I was all-in CCIV for the last month. Daily, I moved my stop-loss up to protect fat gains. When it was at ~$60, my stop loss was set at $50/45. My average was $20 so this was a solid 2.5x gain at minimum (in my head). 

Closes $57, opens $39 after their merger announcement. Skipped over my stop-loss, I eventually sold at $34. 

Solid gain still (1.7x) but my stop-loss protection got fucked by an overnight revaluation.",1,0,1615419743,banyan-the-cat
20,gqichjn,"If the stock you buy drops a ton after hours your stop loss is not going to save you. It can easily lock in a larger loss than you think you’re risking when it converts to a market order. Your dad’s handing you the keys to the Porsche before you have your permit. Make all your big mistakes with small money. As you learn what works and what doesn’t then increase the amount of money you use. The PDT rule seems annoying but here’s a secret: nobody with $25,000+ is making consistent money day trading. You’re not missing out.",1,0,1615419945,Crazy-Inspection-778
