3,gqdk830,Use their data aggregation for disparate systems platforms and it’s easily the best. Why no one is even competing against it with a product because it’s such a pain in the ass. Yet PLTR did at an enterprise level and boils it down to a tabula type dashboard.,7,0,1615325705,Hank-TheSpank-Hill

7,gqdlo8n,"I work in the same industry as Palantir.  They don’t have any direct competitors for their software.  They are the only one of their kind.  Others have tried and they are no where near what Palantir can provide from a product perspective.  They signed a contract with the US Army last year for around $800m and once they are embedded in organizations you can’t get them out.  Very simply they don’t have a direct competitor with what they can offer.

If you need BIG data analytics they are the only game in town.  The biggest negatives I’ve always seen with them is the requirement for Oracle licensing, database management (which they get paid on that too) and how expensive their products are to implement.  They don’t want to do deals with anyone unless you are paying them $10m+ a year.  That may change as they’ve created other tech capabilities for customers who don’t need the big data sledgehammer however them offering an AWS solution especially with AWS Fedcloud changes the game again.

I’m a bull on Palantir.  If people truly understood the power in their technology, constant investment they make in making their technologies better, and their competitive advantage they would be bulls on this stock as well.

I have 15k shares and I’m continuing to buy more.  

I’m a believer in their technology and in terms of big data analytics they are in their own league when it comes to that industry market share.

If the market on a lot of tech stocks is based on speculation vs current profitability like Tesla or others, Palantir’s stock should be much higher IMO.  

I like the company.  I like the management and investors.  I like the technologies.  I like that no one else in industry can compare to them.  I like that they continually invest to make new products and make their current products better.

If investors really understood the big data analytics market they would be swooning over Palantir as an investment.  They are the Tesla of big data analytics software but primed even better to take over a larger global market once their lighter packages are more affordable.  These reasons are likely why Cathie Wood is such a bull on them too.",11,1,1615326356,Starscream_777

29,gqgb4ji,"what do you think the P/S ratio in 2025 will be? 

in their Q4 earnings, PLTR estimated revenue to reach minimum 4 billion by 2025, which is about a 30% annual growth rate each year from 2021 to 2025. 

if the revenue growth rate were 45% each year, we would get 7 billion of revenue by 2025 (1.1b \* 1.45\^5). If the PS drops to  20, the market cap would only be 140 billion, indicating a 3.33 times increase. which is impressive, but seemed overhyped? i hope im wrong here haha. I do own a few PLTR shares because i like the stock and ark invest bought it. im just doing my DD here and giving the company extra scrutiny.",1,0,1615389209,xerxesbear
