Basically, RKT made $9.4b last year, which gave it a trailing PE of 4.4 at $20.

The move to $40 gives a PE of 8.8.

Financials have an average PE of 12.2. So, assuming it just rises to match the others in its category it would be around $60 a share. 

That said, there are some risks, but also some serious possible huge wins. 

Hence, $60 is top end, but if they deliver, they would be a $200 - 400 billion company in a few years.

88,gphm8xt,"So, they are a combo tech and finance company.

The hardest part to valuing them is estimating future origination volume (mortgages) and the related gain on sale, as this is the largest part of their business.

The fear is twofold
1 - Anyone that was going to refinance already did.
2 - rising rates will reduce any other refinancing and stop housing sales.

Those are valid concerns, but I believe they are far overblown, because rates aren't going anywhere. 

So, that is the bear case. 

The bull case is:
1 - They are an applied tech company, that can profitably scale, far more efficiently than competitors (confirmed in FY2020), which means they will continue to grab market share. 
2 - They are becoming a one stop shop for all financial needs (mortgages, cars, title insurance, real estate), and effectively use their consumer credit data to target consumers for their other services (real estate to mortgage to title insurance).
3 - They are signing deals for essentially 3rd party selling on Amazon (Morgan Stanley, etrade both signed deals for RKT to originate conforming loans for their clients).

So, lots of uncertainty, lots of opportunity.
