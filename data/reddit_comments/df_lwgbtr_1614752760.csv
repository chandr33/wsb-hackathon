I read on the news the difficulties that are having Google with  [Stadia](https://insights.dice.com/2021/03/02/stadia-studio-collapse-hints-at-a-core-problem-for-developer-teams/) in their attempt to go fully digital which (as DFV said) we are not ready yet. In fact, when you see the poor connection of Congress Man and Women you clearly see that we are not ready (I'm feeling bad for their online gaming sessions and streaming with that poor connection). Also [Amazon](https://www.protocol.com/amazon-bad-at-games) Luna is suffering and recently loose its [boss](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/amazons-luna-boss-leaves-five-months-after-its-reveal/).

17,gpicr05,"Okay, mathtime: 
Shorters buy to cover their shorts okay? Price will go up INSANE!

There are what, about 150% of the float held by institutions? So when they give back these shares to cover their shorts, these shares are out of the pool, because those institutions, who hold big simply can't sell tomorrow (correct me if I'm wrong here).

The only way to drive the price down is shorting again, or massively people selling for too low.

Now shorters are still short, because they also need big volume of institutional shareholder's shares. This might be nearly impossible within a few days but it's not just citadel and melvin who needs to cover. And when the price is really crazy high and some other guys want to cover (because nobody should trust his former enemy), this is about to get really sick.

Math: More than 100% is Impossible, but they managed to get institutions holding more than 100%.

Worst case is, that GME is an infinite money printer for a long time (like Tesla, but even bigger).",8,0,1614754306,Susher89

21,gpid0kg,"I think part of why people are suspicious of RKT is how sudden it all was.

62,gpih66a,"I know, me too...I don’t want to be the last one in the room anxiously waiting for $25k, posting ALL CAPPED MESSAGES about going to the moon, etc just to find out a day or two later that everyone else scooted out of there @ $15000-20K and us noobs got stuck holding the check (it sure felt like that for a little while buying in @ almost $300!).

Look, my best performing stock is ZOM; it’s up almost 10x and I expect to see it go maybe another 10x in the long run (maybe next 2-3 yrs?), so that would mean that if I’m gonna use that logic, I’d be a fool if I don’t start to sell 1 share at a time (only have 13) once it starts to get in the low $1000’s.  Heck, I’ve got to at least recover the investment at some point (akin to putting your original $20 back in your pocket when the slot machine pays out a little jackpot....you keep playing hoping for more, but at least your original $20 is still there and you live to play another day).  

 I’ll feel like a total fool if it hits $100000 and I sold my last share—-correction—-second to last share (one is being kept for perpetuity to show grandkids and great grandkids in the future that their pawpaw was crazy enough to take a chance!) at “only” $30k, but I won’t be sad because I would’ve been invested in some boring stock only making 20-30% instead of 10000%
