20,gqex8l7,"Share counterfeiting is not really a thing.  Brokerages took owned shares and allowed them to be borrowed and sold short, which were bought by somebody whose brokerage loaned them out again to be sold short.  It‚Äôs just a fucked up broken ass system.  And as some asshole on CNBC said while criticizing day traders, every share on the NYSE was held for an average of 48 seconds n 2019.  They‚Äôre being bought and sold so quickly by high frequency trading Lagos that nobody can keep track of what‚Äôs going on.  And the result is, with GME, so many shares were loaned out and loaned out again that there are more shares that are being traded than actually exist.  Kind of a problem!  But did anybody do anything illegal?  Nope.  The laws are just stupid as fuck and need to be changed to reflect the current environment.

51,gqexawr,"I am fairly certain it's a very different ""they"".  I know it's a highly unpopular opinion, but I very much believe Melvin exited sub-$90 back in Jan as they claimed.  Why else would they get $2.75M in new capital - no way someone is underwriting them to pursue the same losing strategy - if it were me the new money would be contingent on them being out of GME.  I think the shorts are a revolving door but the good news is this 52% batch presumably has a much lower short starting point than the 60% batch from 2 weeks prior, meaning this upward momentum is hurting them way worse and should drive a higher chance for a margin call.",2,0,1615351833,somedood567

60,gqexbms,"That contract will probably be worth 30+ dollars tomorrow at open if the AH price stays the same as it is now. The closer to the expiration date of the contract the less it‚Äôll be worth. You‚Äôre paying for the volatility combined with the time left until expiration date and betting it‚Äôll go up or down. If you only had 2200 and you bought stock, you could buy 9 shares.
If the price goes up 30 bucks tomorrow, you‚Äôll make 270 dollars if you have options, you‚Äôll probably double you money with the same amount of money. If it doesn‚Äôt go up, you could also lose your ass on options and not lose any money just buying stock.",1,0,1615351846,krautius
