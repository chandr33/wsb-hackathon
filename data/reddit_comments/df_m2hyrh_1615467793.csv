18,gql0jzz,"You're both so right on that juicy margins w mattress industry but idk how prpl will hold long term or if it will provide yolo gains even with a superior product. money laundering mattress stores are disappearing at a faster rate as amzn continues to destroy anything BnM and decent enough products like zinus line that are dirt cheap. 

Prpl doesn't appeal to any luxury segment or anything and while they do have proven patented tech, i'm just not sure how long or how many people will continue to spend 2k over a $200 mattress from amazon. 

not to forget how the mattress industry as a whole has always been so shady with their business practices .
