1,gqh5hub,"I use E\*TRADE mobile app and it allows you to set alerts on price hi/lo, percent move, news, etc... then it just pops up on your phone... which is great unless you are talking to someone for 30 minutes while shit is going down ;)",3,0,1615400905,davidahoward1

3,gqh7byd,"Why was this removed? It started off as great advice, but I wasn't done reading it. Mod, what's up? Why can't he tell people to be careful about placing stop losses on stocks that are yo-yoing?",1,0,1615401629,ForestOfHandsNTeeth
4,gqh7q28,I'm legit disappointed by the mod who pulled this. Why hide good advice? It is because there's actual stocks involved vs options? Playing Robinhood exactly like the app did... for no reason. Shameful.,1,0,1615401787,ForestOfHandsNTeeth
