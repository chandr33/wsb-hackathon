0,gpk3uea,Actually I had a 3000% gain on RKT calls and I‚Äôm using that to fuel the GME rocket,9,0,1614794174,Halp_dear10

2,gpk444i,You forgot to mention the $1.11 special dividend. They are literally going to pay people to hold the stock. Easy money. Don't be a FUD victim. It's wallstreetbets not wallstreetbet as in more than 1.,1,0,1614794290,Dead_Cash_Burn

6,gpk4fs0,"40% short interest means little if there is large liquidity.  GME doesn't have liquidity in their shares, RKT does.  Y'all got played.",8,0,1614794428,boneywankenobi
7,gpk4kqu,"People been posting about rocket for a while; if anyone took the time to read the posts the situation was a perfect storm the likes of which I've ever only seen with GME before $400. Hedgies ain't setting us up for free tendies.

Crazy though amount of propaganda out by the media trying to hurt GME. I think once things get popular the DD goes to shit and becomes an echo chamber and for that reason GME might burn more people then rkt. I wouldn't take advice from anyone that says hold to 100k; I'd probably block them or inverse them.",-1,0,1614794486,Blanket-presence
8,gpk4pbz,"I mean... literally the same thing can be said about GME bag holders who didn't sell at $170+ a week ago. They could have flipped those profits into other stocks that went way up while GME traded sideways all week and then bought back into GME if they wanted to. All this ""hold till you die"" shit is just making all those people miss out on a lot of gains.  So many stocks had huge runs: PLL, RKT, SOS just to name a few off the top of my head.",2,0,1614794541,NoManufacture
9,gpk52im,"Anyone who didn't sell rocket or ANY stock after a 70% gain IN ONE DAY is a moron. This isn't about what you gain this is about WHAT YOU KEEP. I'd rather have sold RKT for 50-60% gains then hold it and hope and pray it gets up to 100%+ gains because that kind of movement after that substantial of a gain IN ONE DAY isn't realistic.

Could RKT go up to $50 or even higher? Absolutely! Will it be in the next couple weeks? Probably not. Anyone still holding RKT is likely going to be a bagholder for some time.

Not financial advice nor am I an expert.",5,0,1614794701,BooceAlmighty

13,gpk5sds,Don't worry the rocket CEO will buy back their $1billion soon and real shareholders can sit happy,1,0,1614795010,BASEbelt
14,gpk5swx,"Well gme actually had a legitimate once in a lifetime short squeeze that was stopped by some questionable actions... rocket doesn‚Äôt have anything close. I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone thought gme still had some legs before the dtcc did what they did.

Though yes people who held through that were taking on a huge amount of risk but the price action from gme was actually justified by a technical event (which was the play the whole time, an actual unexitable short squeeze barring no outside forces Intervened) not just some forum hype.

This is a casino a lot of the time though as you know so it‚Äôs fun to poke fun at the people who get this angry bc they think their idea is so much better than the next guy.",5,0,1614795016,TheVishual2113
15,gpk5w74,"Also, the obviously new people are thinking of GME and RKT like political parties or tribes.  You don't have to just choose one.  If you have the means and a broker who will put up with it, you can technically take out equivalent short AND long positions on EVERY SINGLE SECURITY AT THE SAME TIME.  

I wouldn't advise that because it's literally impossible to make money that way (zero sum game), but if you want to you can.",1,0,1614795056,ekjohnson9

The first run up of GME was a great play, but it has significantly lower short interest atm.
