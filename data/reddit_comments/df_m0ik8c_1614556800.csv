1,gq7zeul,"I thought it was dumb too, until every room in my house had them. 

They are a legit replacement for cable. You get certain live TV channels, and all your streaming services straight to your TV with no PC needed. 

They even have TV's now with Roku built in. It's the new smartTV IMO. 

Roku has a foot in the ""internet to TV"" market like nobody's business. 

I don't know how they will do stock wise in the future, but I do see them sticking around for a long time, or until a better alternative comes out. 

Have been definitely been on the fence about getting some stock.",5,0,1615218874,TheRumpletiltskin

8,gq7zwez,We are to the point where TVs have WIFI and can house your streaming apps without Roku. I do not see all the TV brands carrying Roku when it will be pretty easy to develop everything in house. Why does Samsung need Roku?,1,0,1615219083,JPM_3000

10,gq7zy16,"Ive been through 3 different ""smart"" Blu ray players. All of the interfaces sucked. They are slow. I bought a roku premiere for 25 bucks and the UI quality and responsiveness is way better.

I purposely bought a non smart TV because I just wanted a TV, none of the smart bullshit, no software updates, it just turns on and does TV stuff. I have had zero issues with my TV, but the reason I been through 3 blu-ray players is because they all died on me (good thing I had the Amazon protection plan).

Not financial advice, just anecdotal stuff and my personal opinion. Also roku works really well with plex.",2,0,1615219101,jlaudiofan
11,gq7zy7j,"Just redid all my AV equip in my home. Close friend owns a AV business. He told me he recommends either roku or apple tv to all his clients. He said when manufacturers make tvs, all the tech, etc is geared towards beautiful resolution, and whatever tech to stream is marginal at best. Another friend lives right up the street from me. Both have xfinity 1000mb down, both with youtube tv. His stream sputters and stops constantly (he streams with tv). Mine hasnt done it one time (roku).

Not sure if that would affect share price. But, I think there will always be a need for a device until manufacturers up their streaming components. 

I dont own any stock in Roku.",1,0,1615219103,Impossible-Sun-4778

13,gq804m8,just dont see what is going to stop TV companies building the app platforms into thier TVs without roku. i personally do not enjoy plugging those into every tv,1,0,1615219181,JPM_3000

16,gq80dv5,"As someone who never buys TVs but gets monitors instead, Roku is a sensible option until I get motivated enough to re-work one of these rpis.

But besides that, when I travel, I can just pack the roku with me. No more shitty hotel channel options.

Hosting a party with friends and watching some sports? Toss the roku in the bag and go.

No need to login to a dozen tvs every month or worry about if the tv actually deleted my login after I was done.",1,0,1615219287,JustAnotherQubesUser

21,gq80p9u,"My opinion...The poor.  Most of society is poor. Those working poor that can afford tech get the lowest tech and keep it forever (unit they can afford to replace with new lowest tech). Roku is free on the cheapest brand smart tv's. Do I need an amazon stick, nope...do I need a roku box, nope. Those cost money. I can also get local channel with no HD antenna. Do I want Roku on my Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, etc. Fuck No! but Ill take it on a visio, sceptre, etc. I just bought a $200 32inch Roku tv for my basement gym...it sucks! it took allday to sign into my streaming accounts and you have to stand ontop of the TV for the remote to work! So just like Radio which is still around to serve primarily the working poor, Roku is the lowest of your tech solutions and is here to stay. My opinion",1,0,1615219428,stefonte_s

26,gq8156h,"Bc Smart TVs donâ€™t have the rights to ALL the apps. Roku does for the most part. Itâ€™s so fucking annoying buying a brand new smart TV and it doesnâ€™t have access to HBO Max, or Hulu or Disney or peacock. Roku does.

I would start by actually researching the matter at hand that you said you have not researched.",1,0,1615219624,JohnDoses

30,gq81gbj,"Have you used the same systems built by the TV company? They generally suck. The TV manufacturers were doing smart TVs for years and they sucked even worse until Apple TV and Roku came along. Because the manufacturers suck so much, if they are smart, they will continue to focus on what they are good at (making TVs) and let someone else do the stuff they arenâ€™t good at (Roku).

Besides all that, why couldnâ€™t Roku build TVs? And/or make their own content?

In fact, why is cable even still a thing? Why havenâ€™t computer screens replaced TVs?

A possible disruption could be content exclusive to certain TV manufacturers, but I suspect that will only happen if the manufacturer is the one producing the content (think Samsung exclusive content). Sony could do that, but I suspect it isnâ€™t worth their money and it would be more of what theyâ€™ve done with PlayStation network exclusives.",1,0,1615219763,MichaelEvo
