Intrinsic is purely based off the difference between the strike price and the market price. If the strike is $10 and the market price is $15, the intrinsic value is $5 (15-10) x 100 shares, since the option is for 100 shares. The extrinsic is a mix of time until expiry and implied volatility, for both of which more means higher price.

94,gphymdr,"&gt;13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.

Ehh, but is it? 13% shorted is high?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months.

P/E is price to earnings. For that, you need earnings. ***What earnings???*** Look at their net profit, they make 517 thousand then bleed out over 5 million the next. That's insane. Looking at this I'd probably short UWMC before I buy it. [https://imgur.com/a/Pr8r8RJ](https://imgur.com/a/Pr8r8RJ)

RKT was an interesting play not just because it had high short interest(over 30%) - but because it **WASN'T A MEME COMPANY!** RKT *printed money faster than Jerome Powell*. They tripled their net profit in a quarter and were already profiting billions of dollars per year, with net profits tripling *during a worldwide pandemic/economic recession.* For once in this sub's everloving existence a stock showed up that actually ***makes*** money for a change.

**Unless ameritrade is lying to me &amp; Melvin &amp; co have personally hacked in and edited these results, it appears UWMC is losing almost 10x what they bring in.** That's horrible. Tell me if my eyes deceive me here. **If I am missing something obvious, I'd like to know!**

Let's assume RKT was a total pump &amp; dump &amp; I got stuck holding a bag - I wasn't stuck holding a bag of shit. I would've been stuck bagholding a successful company that makes more money quarter after quarter with a long history of treating its employees well, that just got undervalued by the market. That's easier to digest than holding a bag of genuine shit.

It is completely possible I am wrong and have no idea WTF I am talking about. If I am missing something, please show me the way. Not financial investment advice, I am not an investment advisor, just my opinion. I solder on motherboards, not finance.",1,0,1614744654,larossmann
