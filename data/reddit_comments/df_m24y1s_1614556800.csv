If it's life changing money you sell. You don't hold. You hold what you can afford to lose and don't care about. Especially if you arn't using your own money to buy, You take the win.",5,0,1615401739,Nevrian

16,gqh7qdb,"paper hands, how did u lose money on gme.  I mean the stock is up from 40$ to roughly 300 today and u lost money on that?  dont sell at a loss or if your going to put stop losses in.  only way to actually lose money is by really not investing properly.  anyways best of luck and sorry for your loss.",0,0,1615401790,Tannereast

20,gqh88y5,"Your mistake of buying on margin wasn't your biggest mistake.  
Your biggest mistake was not learning your lesson the first time around.  
You bought on margin, you got margin called on a massive loss, and almost wiped out.  So what did you do?  Did you fucking turn off margin and only buy on cash so you have control over when you sell, and not your broker?  No, you went back and did the same damn thing again so you could finish the job of getting wiped out.    
  
And why be mad at your broker?  It's not a shitty mechanic, it's risk management.  They loaned you money to buy the stock.  If it moves against you and it's down so far that you no longer have the money in your account to cover the margin maintenance, they have to close your position.  Why should they take on the risk that the stock doesn't recover and you can't cover the margin lent, to protect your profits (or protect you from loss)?  They shouldn't.  They're going to close your position before they lose money (or while they've only lost a little).  
  
Do yourself a favor and learn the lesson this time.  Don't use margin on volatile stocks.  Full stop.",3,0,1615401997,budlightguy
21,gqh89hr,"well that's just dumb lol.  I use margin for like 50-100$  trades on bybit that's all I add to my account a week, thats my little gamble money I play with.  gme too but I would never margin something that volatile that's retarded.  with that level of retardedness this guy should be up 1 mill",3,0,1615402003,Tannereast
22,gqh8ejn,"This is heartbreaking, to challenge the system so fundamentally requires us to acknowledge that every dirty trick will be played. I watched that big drop and instantly thought ""fuck, good thing I don't have stop loss on this"" of course the next thing I thought was how many of us got caught out. How much of the dip was a chain reaction? Truly heartbreaking. Rinse all available credit cards and loans and buy the dip. Fuck it.",2,0,1615402060,Datum_Dude
23,gqh8n31,Yeah i agree. Probably not too well off trying to make a quick buck and i feel for the guy. Should have taken that 10k and if he wanted use that money to invest himself with his own mone rather than stay in margin.,2,0,1615402155,Nevrian
