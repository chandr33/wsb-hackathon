7,gq92ngq,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,1,0,1615235535,VisualMod
