41,gqhcwbd,"Yeah don't listen to the downvotes. I did so last time and got burned, went in at 300, then kept buying the dips and stopped buying after a while because I was in way too deep. i waited for the rise but sold too early, successively, once at \~105$, once at \~130$, once just now at \~265$, still have 2 shares left for the lulz. lost a few thousand $ but learned a TON about myself and the market. 

I believed the crap of short ladder attacks and shit, whereas in hindsight the thing is pretty simple: The stock gets momentum. some big players lose a ton of money, but other big players WIN a ton of money because they jump on the train. the winning big players see a good exit point, sell their shit at a big profit, the stock plummets due to volume not being high enough for the sell-off, the stock recovers, the next institution sells off, some people try to still push the stock, it may go to 300 or so over the next days, but that's a risky expectation. then the stock will fall, because the momentum loses trust after these crazy volatile days, but not as low as last time, say, 80$ or so. it will still be shorted but shorts got burned again and will have to cover some of their positions. there will be next nice entry points in a few weeks, the next rise will happen, but again, not as high as the last one (this) and neither the subsequent drop. in a few months the stock will be relatively stable at, say, something around 130-200$. this is a decent price for the stock because the upcoming ecommerce stuff will be a great opportunity for GME, but not a 400$-per-share opportunity. everyone stops trading this stock and things can go back to normal. we all will remember the days and have a cool story to talk about, some will have gained much, other lost much.",1,0,1615403906,Cangar

GME can not be shorted the rest of today and tomorrow‚Äôs trading session. If that‚Äôs the case, this could be a planned event from a hedge on the bullish side.

72,gqiozbj,"Lol. Today is not how a big player cashes out. If you think it is, holy fuck, you are retarded. Big players want to cash out very slowly once their price target is hit in order to not cause a crash. If they can extract themselves with their profit at their price target, they are happy. If their PT was say $350, why would they proceed to crush the price down to $170 which guarantees that they won't get $350 for their shares? Even if their PT was say $300, they wouldn't get that today with the volume it took to crush the price. Maybe if their PT was $200 it would make sense, however, why would they let the price run up to $350 then? They would have just met buy orders at $200 until they were out. Today was malicious and calculated. It was not a big player exiting.",1,0,1615426571,Im_A_Canadian_Eh
