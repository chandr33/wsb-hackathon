Last ride up to $483, I remember we had these dips once or twice a day. For the last week or so, we've barely seen one.

I'm thinking that however this is done, and if it is some form of short laddering or hedgies stocking up their shorts, it feels like it is being done deliberately and coordinated.

Just through lunch, in the hopes that people would panic as no one was around to help pick it up.

I held @ $320, all the way up to $483, down around $40 and back up again and I'm not even sweating a little bit.
