61,gqazzxm,"tldr: I think 3/19 expiration date will benefit the momentum in $GME and keep Nasdaq surpressed because it 's sell off is funding momentum in $GME and other overly hedged stocks (the sell off has been mentioned mainly because of yield rates, but DOW and S&amp;P hold firmly.)

To all of you who posted so many DD on short squeeze, gamma squeeze, fundamentals and even some TA: thank you

Restricted my ideas to 3/19/21 for this question.

Yesterday, as $GME stock hit $200, this could be triggered by market makers (MM) to hedge against the option chain towards that number expiting this week and next week.

This would be forced by gamma/delta changing, hence a gamma squeeze and to me this looks to have started after $40-$45 weeks when stockprice steadily went up, with even on alow volume day a higher closing every day.

Question:

Am I right to think, that because of the option chain between $200 and $250 and $250 and $300 doesn't have a lot of open interest till 3/19 a gamma squeeze as such would not be as intense as the last few weeks? (please see also short squeeze later on which may induce further gamma squeeze adding to momentum again)

Yesterday, some more stock was shorted. We can discuss whether intrest rate for that is high or low, I think intrest rate not that important as a cost factor for the decision a HF takes at this moment as it is marginal cost to them (ofcourse total intrest payment is adding up for them)

I think the amount that was shorted yesterday was not that much. I read about 400K. So as it was shorted, and price and volume still went up, there also might have been HF covering previous positions and HF going long as well. But this is not a short squeeze at the moment.

Question: am I correct?

Nasdaq decline, mainly contributed to rising yield on bonds (return on invested nominal value of a bond)

I don't buy into this. Dow and S&amp;P still at high -close to AH for Dow- levels. If bond rates are that important to traditional investors, they'd have pulled out of stock in general.

Media too tell us 'we're shifting from growth stock to traditional stock as flying and travel will increase, bla bla bla etc. etc.'

I don't buy this either. It may have contributed for some investors, but not all of them. Why? because investments in Nasdaq are mainly done by investors that purposefully invest in it. They don't suddenly start to invest in traditionals.

MMs collected premiums for selling futs , which plunged OTM after Nasdaq drop

HFs that might have shorted Nasdaq have had a nice payday too.

This kind of money adds up. And that's nice, as they will need it to hand over to you and me , as there is some outstanding debt in $GME positions: short positions and the options sold by MM

Now, the option chain till $250 is mostly empty, but Hfs might start to close positions thus a sort of slow short squeeze until also MM step in and start buying stock as gamma changes.

This would have the two squeezes combined, adding yet again momentum, and the rest will be history after the dust settles when both MM and HF scramble to find shares to cover.

Final question: am I a goofy quanon like for thinking that Nasdaq money has been freed to relieve pressure on MMs at the futures side of the market and profiting Hfs.",1,0,1615274877,iamjustinterestedinu
