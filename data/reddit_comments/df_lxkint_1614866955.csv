When melvin shorted the stock, he basically punched you (and me) straight in the dick.  This is evidenced by trading irregularities throughout February, and a lot of weird bruises that I have noticed around my criminally undervalued groin region. We need to trigger a major squeeze on all of our dicks (yes, even you ladies) until we can ejaculate tendies all over the lunar surface.  If we don't hold strong and buy the dips, or hell, just flat out buy the shit out of this thing, we're never going to make it back to where we need to be.  I bet what I can lose.  I am holding.
