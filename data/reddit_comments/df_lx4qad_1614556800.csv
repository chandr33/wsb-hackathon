Or maybe buy more GME?",71,0,1614808050,MattyFree

35,gplh75b,If you look at what this post is saying then that is in line with the similarities. Pre market also tomorrow should just hover around same price. For it to be similar after that would mean it would have to get up near or surpass $200 tomorrow. Weâ€™ll see just how similar it is I guess.,2,0,1614816356,WalkerTejasRanger
