UWMC went to bat for brokers saying they had enough of this  unethical stuff going on as they only work with brokers.  I'm hearing well over 90% of brokers bent the knee for UWMC and told RKT to sod off (only makes sense since their interests are aligned here).  UWMC processes loans much faster and has a much better relationship with brokers...UWMC has already won this battle.
