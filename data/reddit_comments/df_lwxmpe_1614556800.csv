32,gpk6lt0,"I don't really agree with a lot of your reasoning. I'll go through each point to discuss what I think. Some good, some bad, some maybe somewhere in between. I'm mostly skeptical on this stock choice, really, but if they can pivot to just buying other weed companies that have proven to function well - hard to do at this point - then I could see them being more of a weed investment company. Essentially, their only route to success as it stands is to trim costs more, fire employees, and become a Berkshire Hathaway of weed. Not exactly an easy thing to do.

**EPS:** Their EPS 'increasing' is not due to an increase in earnings. The earnings themselves have actually decreased exponentially. They just keep diluting these losses every quarter via additional public offerings.

**Trading Sideways:** I'm not sure this means anything, to be honest. 

**Huge Volume:** If their is huge volume and price is stabilizing, maybe this means an activist investor is coming in to clean house with management. This may be a good thing, since they have a huge amount of cash, and a good activist investor can use that cash to actually produce a decent product.

Two things though.

1) Huge volume + price stabilized means a lot of people are selling just at the same time that one or two people are buying a ton up, or vice versa. Can't really say which, but if the price is stable AND their is huge volume, just as many people are selling as buying. Could go either way. If the buyers keep buying after the sellers sell, then maybe it will go up.

2) activist investors are not always right. Bringing in somebody new to change the place carries a lot of risk if and when the changes are actualized. For perfect examples of when it goes wrong vs right, just look at Pershing Square.  JCPenney was empirically a flop, while most any of PSH's other investments turned out well. It has some inherent risk to it as it is.

**Options Activity:** I have a post on WSB where I discuss (among many other things) just how suspect their options trading is. For one, a day before a stock offering was announced, a huge volume of $5 call options were placed when the stock was itself only $.50. This required MM's to purchase a ton of shares, which elicited a rally. This is actual fraud imo, and I'm just waiting for the SEC to step in. It will be hard to actually enforce anything, because they are a Canadian company, but maybe the Mounties will be investigating as well.

This unusual options activity is actually the smoking gun for why I would not invest in Sundial. Their prices go up regardless of any actions the company takes, and I feel it serves as a way to extract extra wealth from gullible investors. I don't want to be a gullible investor. 

Add in the fact that it was all done THE DAY BEFORE an announcement, and this makes me think the company is in on the market manipulation. They are the only ones that stood to benefit from the suspicious activity, and of course, the price dropped after reaching a high of $4.

**Weed is good:** Agree somewhat. It's a brand new commodity, but the additional competition will sharply bring the price down to what you'd expect from a plant. Add in the fact that customers demand incredible quality, and you realize that building another greenhouse stands as a huge barrier for expansion. It may not always be as simple as planting it in the ground and letting it grow. It is super expensive, and the cost to produce these goods is insane. Water, electricity, employees, researchers, property and land, and many other things all contribute to a huge overhead that presses competition that much harder. 

My question from this point is: what has Sundial done that their competition hasn't yet?

Please bare with my very skeptical viewpoint about this company. I am but a simple smooth brain who really does not want to invest in a company and lose my money.",12,0,1614795363,jhuntinator27

35,gpka496,"I want you idiots to understand that just because there is open interest in a certain strike it doesn't mean anyone is expecting price to get to that strike. In fact, it's far more likely that a HF is shorting those contracts naked, and whoever made the market for that trade - another HF is forced to buy those options, but know expecting price to get that high is stupid, so they delta weight their books by selling short shares equal to the delta of the options contracts they were forced to buy by the first hedge fund. The more price goes up the more the second HF needs to short shares to balance their sheets. THEY NAKED SHORT FAR OTM CALLS TO ARTIFICALLY CREATE SELLING.. and it works by creating compounding selling. They have every intention of letting those contracts expire worthless and the second hedge fund doesn't give a shit if they do because they've already weighted their books to expect that to happen. And every moron here buys up those far otm contracts because they see the Oi and don't understand wtf is happening.

49,gpp989p,"Yea that's what I'm saying. It almost feels like they're more concerned with equity financing than making a viable business.

If they go vape routes, they do decrease the overhead for high quality weed, but in turn, they are also increasing the costs of processing. I wonder what the trade off is, tbh, and if they have to increase costs of buying weed from a wholesaler, and ramp up their fees for things like safety, efficacy of the equipment / product line.

I do think that's the way to go, not traditional flower. Personally, I think the move with the company that makes wana edibles was a solid move as well. Edibles are a growing field, and new technology is apparently making it a much more viable process to make them as well.",2,0,1614893556,jhuntinator27
