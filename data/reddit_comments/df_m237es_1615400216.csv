I should have written you prior, but did not know for a certainty where to direct. I sincerely hope this letter I write will find it's way to you and your beloved mister. How I long to see his chiseled jaw rested gently against thine bosoms'! Oh glory!

You will doubtless have learned the details of the Great GME War before this reaches you. The losses of the 28th were dreadful. A mere fortnight ago one could not have imagined the tragedy that besieged us that day. Many a paper handed retard were smite from the field of battle, their voices silenced by the unrelenting march of the vindictive hedgies.

But on we marched, with our brothers in misery perched upon our sturdy shoulders. Despite our tiresome predicament, fortune smiles upon us as many a foreign retard and autist offered assistance in our endeavor. Twas much sought after since the hedgies sneakily thieved much of the ammunition in the early dawn. We shall persevere and hold our ground. Nary an inch will be submitted to our enemies as they musn't be allowed to posses this sacred field of tendies.
