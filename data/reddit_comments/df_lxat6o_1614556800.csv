The ceo said yesterday in an interview they are looking for merger partner and are launching a new system late this year that is focused on production and prototyping, instead of just prototyping.

14,gpm2m1l,"Not really, they don't sell chips at market price. TSMC is already fully booked for the next 2 years. Plus auto chips are so cheap they don't actually profit much from it.",4,0,1614827704,snailSucculents
15,gpm2qwn,"NNDM was under $2 as recently as October. They've raised an absurd amount of equity (like $1.4B) over the past 6 months to the point where they now have \~$5.94 in cash per share, which does give it a bit of a floor for now. 

My concern here is that their executives just diluted the crap out of shareholders and are facing big expectations to do something other than sit on the cash pile, hence the M&amp;A comments. Between current high valuations and the pressure on execs to act there's a good chance that they're going to end up jumping into a really crappy deal that will destroy shareholder value. If that happens, look out below.",3,0,1614827774,TheDirtyDagger

18,gpm40gk,Actually you really need to listen to the interview the ceo just did. He mentioned this exact thing and stated that spacs that are about to dissolve because of the 2 year rule are bidding up American private companys and he is not willing to pay that type of price. He specifically said he is focused on Europe for a merger because Europe doesn't have spacs. I will post the interview,6,0,1614828417,mgez

21,gpm4pgl,"Yes. Buy AMD. Better tech than Intel but cheaper than NVIDIA, no fabrication operations because they were losing money on it a few years ago so sold it off to focus on design, which I think gives them more flexibility to adapt to capitalize on any investments that could be coming from the public sector, and they probably aren‚Äôt bleeding money from production constraints like the others. Probably the best CEO in the space as well. 

I also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they‚Äôre positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well. Much more mature company too with a nice dividend ($.65/share).",6,0,1614828778,notpr1m

Sell calls or buy puts. Do not sell puts during a crash. You will get hurt.

Also, timing the market comes down to extreme luck if you don't have insider information. It can bounce or crash whenever. 'Tis why even the pros say to just spend that time averaging down.",3,0,1614829686,cheepcheepimasheep
