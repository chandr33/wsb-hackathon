Which he did. He told them, ""Stop doing that, and here, let me show you how to make this very minor change so you can keep doing the same thing but now be technically within the law.""

We couldn't believe it. When we asked him why he did that, he was apologetic, but said, ""My job is to bring businesses into compliance with the law.""

65,gqj750k,"They see the orders before you do, that's why I said order flow.  This would be way better coming from a market maker, but you'll just have to settle with what little I've got.

From what I know the trading desk market makers need to make sure they can process orders properly and the price volatility we see, is from their own internal volatility in order flow.  If they start getting swamped, and they start screwing up, that's really bad for everyone, so it's at their discretion when trading stops because GME is not the only asset on the market.  You can see others affected as well.

It's funny, the idea of hedge funds having control over this or the media just doesn't make sense.  If they did, why would they let price go up at all?

I'm in line with people who are calling out general manipulation through ""legal"" order flow though and that kind of stuff, and I bet digging into the data might give some more insight, but I guess I figured people are already on top of that and from what I see the exact methodology isn't clear.

And I'm not sure I have a problem with the Canadian law that news has to be true. In practice, it doesn't seem to be causing much trouble.

See, here's the problem as I see it: I love liberty. Wouldn't trade it for the world.

It is stop losses...which make sense in stocks where the price is not so volatile and there isn't so much at stake.

It's extra shitty in this case cause the MM like citadel can see where the stop losses are set......all it requires is to drop the price quickly and it causes a cascading effect of price being pushed down as more and more stop losses are reached. 

The price crashes quickly and bounces back up again (similar to what you saw today). Now the people who had their shares sold have two choices...either give up or go back and often buy back the shares at a higher price.

Stop losses have their place in a trading strategy -- just not on a stock like GME (or any other volatile stock).
