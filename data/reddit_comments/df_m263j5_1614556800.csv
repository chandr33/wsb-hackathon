1. The Great Depression plus two World Wars meant that there was a lot of built up demand in the market that was able to be fulfilled at the end of the war. The pandemic alone has not produced a similar demand.

2. The New Deal was radically progressive for its time, putting a heavy tax on the rich and creating jobs and social safety nets that lifted the entire economy from the bottom up. We have nothing remotely this radical being proposed today.

3. After WWII, the US was the only major country untouched by the war. It had no real competition and became the manufacturer of the world. There was a huge demand for it, as a lot of the rest of the world was being rebuilt. This caused a lot of wealth to flow into the US. The US is not in anything resembling this situation today.

15,gqhk5wi,"&gt;The Great Depression plus two World Wars meant that there was a lot of built up demand in the market that was able to be fulfilled at the end of the war. The pandemic alone has not produced a similar demand.

Fundamental disagreement.  Although COVID-19 is not a war, nor can you easily dissect and measure pent up demand, pent up demand will be a major contributing factor in the coming economic boom.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The New Deal was radically progressive for its time, putting a heavy tax on the rich and creating jobs and social safety nets that lifted the entire economy from the bottom up. We have nothing remotely this radical being proposed today.

The direct stimulus payments to Americans during COVID are unprecedented in the entirety of US history, both in scope and scale.  This is the definition of lifting the economy from the bottom up, especially in conjunction with infrastructure spends to facilitate new job growth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After WWII, the US was the only major country untouched by the war. It had no real competition and became the manufacturer of the world. There was a huge demand for it, as a lot of the rest of the world was being rebuilt. This caused a lot of wealth to flow into the US. The US is not in anything resembling this situation today

Manufacturing is indeed a headwind for US growth, however the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and highlighted our need to renew our focus on domestic manufacturing.  Large US manufacturers pivoting to produce PPE en masse and operation warp speed are a couple examples of our slow manufacturing domestic policies and private companies rising to the task.

While climate change is very real, I believe the US is at a critical inflection point, and we have the political machine tuned to respond.

19,gqhm1ct,"&gt;  Although COVID-19 is not a war, nor can you easily dissect and measure pent up demand, pent up demand will be a major contributing factor in the coming economic boom.

Yes, you can calculate this, and estimations have been made. It doesn't come close to comparing to the 15 years of pent up demand leading up to the post-war era, though. Our economy also works very differently, where instead of a population unable to afford what they want, we have a population deep in debt because major purchases are with debt now.

&gt; The direct stimulus payments to Americans during COVID are unprecedented in the entirety of US history, both in scope and scale.

Don't fall for the propaganda, it's not close. FDR proposed an *income cap* to congress while Biden is specifically against Medicare For All or a Green New Deal, both of which only approaching how radical the New Deal was. Even if Biden pushes through all his proposed policies, the US will continue to have the weakest social safety nets of any industrialized country. By contrast, the New Deal was the most progressive platform of any industrial society when it was proposed. There is just no basis for a comparison here.

&gt; Manufacturing is indeed a headwind for US growth, however the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and highlighted our need to renew our focus on domestic manufacturing.

Private capitalists outsourced jobs to China for cheaper labor and higher revenue. China is now exporting its manufacturing to poorer countries than it. There is no indication of any shift in manufacturing returning to the US, especially at the level it was after WWII.

&gt;  I am of the belief that infrastructure and energy innovation will prevail, and we will be flying gravity drive spaceships to Mars within our lifetimes.

Participation rate isn't terribly lower than last year either so it isn't a case of a lot of people not looking for jobs driving it down (in fact there is a lot more incentive to pretend to look and many states allow you to not even put out applications to recieve benefits, you can just claim you are afraid of COVID and get some unemployment)

So even with reasons not to work we are still hitting a number we would have been happy to have a decade ago.   Manufacturing can't keep up with demand in many sectors right now to top it off.

The industries that are shutdown right now are also primarily industries that don't provide direct economic value (restaurants, entertainment, and travel are all recreation) so while we miss them the economy as a whole likely won't feel long term effects from them being closed.

55,gqjrkgd,"I'm also hard pressed to believe Biden's policies will be like a new deal. However Covid has kicked the ant hill and forced society to evolve, which is already starting to create new economic growth. I suspect presidents in fact have little control/impact/relevance to economic cycles and might be more a result of that.  


There's a shift towards the next level of cost reductions; Tech shift in the US towards cloud and networks and decentralization are changing everything:  


* Many white collar and R&amp;D will continue to work from home. Companies are finding it makes sense. Workers commuting and using office space impact the bottom line.
* Companies are also dematerializing their IT, replacing buying hardware with buying time on cloud solutions. It's been announced for decades but solutions are now here.
* Consumers have made the shift to online purchases. Retail stores have made the shift to exist online too and sync their inventory.
* Consumers have embraced decentralisation and competition, cutting away the middle man: AirBnB, Turo, Uber, Netflix,  etc. 

This transformation will create growth in new areas, and workers tied to the old ways will need to adapt. The churn is far from over: offerings are exploding but not consolidated enough. For example netflix/disney/hbo/prime/hulu etc. can't last and need to merge just like music services did.

Ecology is back in focus now that MAGA's fading. Green projects are back in the spotlight. Oil companies are the new evil tobacco companies , and Tesla's a darling. Solar farms, wind farms are growing fast, and there's a push to change the car. If anything Biden will likely help with that.  
This will create a new wild-west economy with new car companies.   


Will Biden fix the highways and bridges by hiring construction workers? Will he realize the money is not efficiently used but funneled into the pockets of halliburton, caterpillar or other pigging out on tax dollars?  


Will biden increase taxes to corps and wealthy? If so what good will it do to the economy? Can it cover all the QE money and the runaway deficit, and be used to create new wealth for the rest? Is it even worth fixing that vs letting inflation eat that up? What happens if the rich slow investing their money and financing startups and shoring the stock market? Wether it's ethical to have people insanely rich is one thing, trying to fix it by kicking the machinery might not be the wisest method. You touch one thing and something seemingly unrelated falters.
