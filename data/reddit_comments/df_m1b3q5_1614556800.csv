2,gqcmh3l,"Had the same thing, but i had bought shares and sold shares at a loss last time.  I believe they are applying that balance to the break even since it would be considered a wash sale.  The good news for me is that i am about 20 bucks from breaking even on the previous loss and the new share costs ( i bought in at 101 this time ).  I am kicking myself for not buying back in a 40 when it held soo freaking strong ( you apes are amazing ).  Also sad i sold my 500 calls for a loss when if i had held those, they would have been in the money again now since they didnt expire until 3/19.  I probably need ""paper handed bitch"" flair for this...",1,0,1615310547,BitOfDifference
