6,gqa9e9k,"People are blindly ignoring fundamentals in favor of speculation and sentiment. Which worked in AMC and GME. Why? National and now Global brand recognition, as well as everyone likes video games and/or movies. PLTR, no one seems to know what they do, and redditers seem to think partnering with AWS and 150 million in government contracts equals rocket fuel. Not on a company with a huge market cap, and shitty asset and equity to revenue ratios. John and Jane every person are not going to PLTR on the regular to make a purchase. Learn a little bit about what you are doing, you can still make bets, but you can make bets where the cards are stacked in your favor, rather than against odds in the houses favor.",-5,0,1615257017,JimCricket99

13,gqaczza,Pltr is one of those long term bets that you hope will be a 50 dollar stock in 20 years... after having been split 8 times.,6,0,1615259005,videogamesjdkdjdj

17,gqahvn2,"I dont think it will ever split with the amount of shares they have now, with intention of continued issue for compensation. But I do bet on it being 1000 a share in 10+ years if the market works the way they claim it will. Average house will probably be 2 mil by then on the other side.",1,0,1615261750,impulsiveinvestor

19,gqao139,"My PLTR position is a mix of stocks and LEAPs, with most of them being for 1/23. Down at least 33% in my position (cost was about $160K total), but expect good things long-term from this.",1,0,1615265541,aka0007

35,gqc62wu,It also loses money right now and has a forward PE of 108. It's a pretty expensive stock when I look at it knowing nothing about the stock except it's been mentioned around wsb and that it is some sort of analytical software.,1,0,1615304252,Thunder141
36,gqc6wm3,"Exactly. From what I understand, and admittedly it is hard for me to be knowledgeable about this, this software is transformative in how businesses (especially large ones) can operate. It gives the insight into operations allowing for more efficient and effective and more timely decision-making. Once companies use it, they buy up which is a great sign. Further, as one business uses it, it will likely drive competitors to need to adopt it to compete. The value is hard to know, but I suspect it is way higher then the company trades for.",2,0,1615304561,aka0007

44,gqe7ic2,It's a gamble that the market will see the value of PLTR before Jan 2023. The return is much higher if the price goes up.,1,0,1615337249,aka0007
