10,gqempfz,"I'm going to preface my response by saying that my current goal for my portfolio is 85k, because it'll allow me to pay off my remaining debts, buy land to start a farm, and reinvest into my small business. I am not looking to get rich off the market right now, just looking to have enough to square away the last vestiges of my irresponsible youth and finally get my life on track in my 30s. I have plenty of time afterward to invest for wealth, and this small goal allows me to tweak my startegy for when I decide it's time to go for it.

I will also preface by saying this should not be taken as financial advice. You asked what I would do in your shoes, and this is the straight dick on that.

You're still looking at 38k if exercised. I'd sit and wait it out. You can always reinvest somewhere else or even back into GME after it inevitably falls back to earth. The market isn't going anywhere and there will be plenty of plays next week when you have almost $40,000 kicking around. For all you know, you could buy back those options and watch it immediately tank, rendering the expenditure fruitless. You're out a bunch of money to prevent something that wouldn't have happened anyways. How many times have any of us made a defensive play emotionally and burned ourselves? This sub is full of those stories.

So, I would let it ride. Use the time between now and Friday to put together DD on some other plays, so that _if_ your calls exercise, you have a plan for the money. 

Most importantly, don't forget to put aside a chunk for tax. Please for the love of god do not forget the taxes.",1,0,1615345423,IHaveGiantBaseballs
