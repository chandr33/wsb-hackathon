22,gpkjxva,"Purchasing 50,000 at 12 would lower the stock price. But it would also be a massive waste on his part and he js far more likely to sell the calls not execute.

Hedge funds don't provide shares btw, they buy them back only to return them to the people they borrowed them from. Dfv would be buying shares from the market maker who sold him the calls. Everything in your post is wrong.",5,0,1614801112,Ashpro2000

28,gpkmg4d,"Why would he sell the calls instead of execute? It's so absurdly ITM, wouldn't he make more money off the execution?

Quick estimate: 500 contracts @ $12 executed at today's price would net around $5 million in profit",1,0,1614802203,ugonlern2day
29,gpkmn0g,"No he would make the same off of selling the calls since he won't also have to buy 500,000 shares at 12.  Options always offer more profit for less money, that is the leverage they offer. That is the point of buying them. If he sells the calls right now he gets $5.456 million. He gets that without having to spend the 600,000 on shares. Vs getting the same needing another 600k to buy the shares. It ends up the same either way.",0,0,1614802287,Ashpro2000

37,gpl0hn1,"It isn't just supply and demand that drive stock price, it is the bids and asks that are affected by this supply and demand.  If a stock is currently trading at 100, you are gonna have to bid at least 100 to get it right? But if you have a bunch or calls you circumvent that and can get the stock at your strike price. That is the benefit of exercising an option.  If your strike is $12, your bid for the shares gets filled at $12.  This lowers the average bid for the stock.  50,000 isn't enough shares to move the price really, but if he had say 5 million at $12, that could significantly lower the stock price.",0,0,1614808301,Ashpro2000

39,gpl1tn4,"The only thing I'm certain about in GME land is that he's holding those calls to expiration and exercising like a madlad edit since I posted this without reading the end part - in theory if an mm holds the writes for his contracts they've already 100% delta hedged it since it's so deep itm, so I doubt that will matter",1,0,1614808889,cp_sabotage
40,gpl35qs,"How many of the hodlers have this level of understanding of the stock market yet make posts that echo around on the front page of WSB?

In case you aren't aware of why this is so off base: look at the volume for GME traded *daily* and see what percentage 50,000 shares is. 

There is a huuuuge difference between 50,000 and 40,000,000. 

There is also a big difference between $40 and $120: that's a 300% increase, on top of a 1000% increase from $4 to $40. 

That GME can sustain this price is amazing, however IMO it will be more difficult to squeeze a third time so everyone please make sure to manage their risks appropriately. I personally believe GME is worth more than $120 a share but it will take some time for it to get there organically so be prepared to hold the bag for a long time if the squeeze doesn't pan out.",1,0,1614809491,godofcatsandgoodfood

With how it all works, would it be possible for hedge funds to just put up ridiculous bids/asks just to manipulate a price? Or how does that get decided. I feel like if you had a huge company that did say put in an order for millions at a certain price that wasnâ€™t near current, how would that effect it?",1,0,1614810471,DewJave

45,gplku0x,"I have heard about large orders at extreme prices that are placed to go into the order book (level 2) without any intent to have them fill. This is very illegal but brokerage course. I don't know if the intent of this is to manipulate the price but I don't know but what I described and what you described at both illegal.  Otherwise, putting in a large order at a price way outside of the bid ask spread wouldn't get filled by the market makers.",1,0,1614818374,Ashpro2000
