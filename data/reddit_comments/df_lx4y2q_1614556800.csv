2,gpl73gf,"I LOVED going into my local Gamestop. I would go in and shoot the shit about new games or consoles, drop a few hundred dollars on something I didn't need but loved anyway. Now with Covid, BOTH local Gamestop stores have been boarded up. I don't like to talk online, I don't chat with randos on chat apps, I AM OLD. I like to have a real face to face conversation about whatever new game is coming out or vent about something I don't like about a new accessory. The store wasn't a place for me to go buy games, it was a place for me to go and talk games. I want that back. 

I don't buy stuff off of there website mostly because it SUCKS to find anything. I just bought a new racing wheel and sim seat for my Xbox, guess what, I went to amazon after spending an hour on Gamestops website trying to find them. They either do not carry what I'm looking for or it's damn near imposable to find.",7,0,1614811327,mergel308
