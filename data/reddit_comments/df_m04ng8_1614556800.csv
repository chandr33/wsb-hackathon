21,gq63em4,The delta is like -.02 not -.2 and I believe there‚Äôs more than one way to hedge. Sell 100k puts at .03 premium. Bag 300k and put aside 4.7m (10m shares @ .5 - .03) in treasury or some shit that‚Äôs guaranteed growth. Earn 2% or so plus 6% (300k/5m) = 8% gain in a year.  Or just sell 4.7m worth of shares they already have and keep the cash in fixed growth assets. It‚Äôs kind of stupid to sell 130m worth of share to hedge against a max loss of 4.7m,1,0,1615170984,RagingHippo33469

27,gq655v9,"It's time you all learn about quarterly and yearly options. Yes, there are options available for every week eventually, but quarterly options become available as soon as a year+ out, while january options specifically become available 2 to 3 years out, meaning that when someone bought those puts, they probably reasonably thought gme was going under. It's the same with all of the options expiring in March 19, which is a quarterly. The reason there are so many puts at the $1 to $10 range is because people legitimately thought GME was going to fail a year ago.",1,0,1615171964,I_sell_FDs

42,gq808t0,"if there's a  squeeze, wouldn't the IV give these some value?

Also post squeeze, when this thing drops rapidly, wouldn't they again gain value? It looks like a similar play with the 800 dollar calls that some people snatches for pennies and now they are worth dollars. Basis the short expiration on these calls, there is next to zero chance that the price hits 800 in such short period, but still a price jump gave them value. In the same way, a sudden price drop could give these puts value.

Just for fun and in order to check how they will react to the price action, I just bought 25 July 16 put contracts with usd 0.5 strike price.",1,0,1615219229,DressMetal
