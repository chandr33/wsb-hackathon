I'm long gme but damn it, I hate it when people beg others to buy and hold or not sell. The damn stock speaks for itself it doesn't need poeple to shill for it.",1,0,1615294066,Cstooby

People didn‚Äôt hesitate to hold back and shill or insult me calling me dumb, even massive downvote my comment, ‚ÄútHe RiDE iS oVER‚Äù, ‚ÄúitS OvER BrO‚Äù, where were post like this when the stock was at the bottom? Instead you know what this forum got? It got its mods removed temporarily and all pro-GME posts were removed. So my response to your post? Fuck that people can say whatever the fuck they want and if people want to start posting gains? Right as the stock is gaining some traction fuck them too!",1,0,1615306528,rnd765
27,gqcdnmv,"How does that even work? He is literally telling people to buy and sell certain stocks with flashing graphics and loud noises and bells. 

It could not get more ""I'm trying to convince you to all in some stupid play"" than his show, how the hell does he actually hide behind ""oh but its not financial advice so play at your own risk tolerance right fellas *\*wink wink\**"" the fuck is this bullshit? 

Can I get away with blatant pump and dump scam emails if I just put in 2pt font on the bottom that it isn't finance advice now? Have we regressed that far?",2,0,1615307138,lastlived
