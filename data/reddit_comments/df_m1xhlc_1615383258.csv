🦍🦍🦍 have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the 🐻🐻🐻 and 🐂🐂🐂  — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. 🦍🦍🦍 must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as 💢great warriors💢, nor counted among the 💯very wise💯. 

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the 🦍🦍🦍 only real passion is for 🍌🍌🍌. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of 🧃🧃🧃, and the smoking of 🌲🌲🌲. But where our 💖💖💖 truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all 🦍🦍🦍 share a love of 📈📈📈 that 🚀🚀🚀.
