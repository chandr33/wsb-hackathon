Rich boys plan was to buy the stonk back from the market when it was only $50, then return the stonk to the original holders of stonk and rich boys keep the difference from when they sold it to when they bought it back. Dfv, ryan cohen, and millions of silly gooses saw this and realized if they all banded together and bought the stonks, they could drive the price up. Well, rich boys need to return their borrowed stonks, but the price is much higher than what they thought it would be. Rich boys have to buy expensive stonk making price go higher. BUT, silly gooses, ryan cohen and dfv have a lot of stonk, so rich boys cant get enough stonks to give back to the guy thry borrowed from. This means stonk very valuable and silly gooses know if they just hold their shares, rich boys will have to pay any price they want to get the stonks.",1,0,1615308680,shnootsberry
