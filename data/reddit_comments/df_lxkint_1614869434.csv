No increase in volume to see the price change differently seems like the algo today is trying to avoid that SSR if there is not enough buying naturally in theory it will do the buying by itself to avoid it. If they dont have a safeguard in place, their algo could end up buying its way out of the SSR at premium share prices so they can short tomorrow, at the cost of the liquidity to be able to do anything.",10,0,1614869445,Splatacular
