The problem right now is that there's nothing that justifies $100/share. Yeah Cohen will probably do well for GameStop but unless there's something to show for it, it'll lose its momentum. Fundamentals do somewhat matter when we are talking about long term plays.

The support for $100 is fleeting and mostly a consequence of GME's intense but effectively neutral volitality. There will be more interesting plays from an institutional and retail point of view alike.",3,0,1614794261,justcool393
