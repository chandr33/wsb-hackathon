We’ll all hate it, but the echo chambers have to die so it’s more difficult for news media to talk about it. It needs to be muddled.",1,0,1615134124,FannyPackPhantom

35,gq3ztto,"Mods have to break it up now though- it’s so easy to manipulate people in mega threads. You say some qanon shit and everyone believes it. 

Let’s be real - no chance the top commenters on the megas are real people. How can you spend all day chatting in a thread if you are just holding shares?",1,0,1615135561,FannyPackPhantom

66,gq6dkx1,"That’s probably the BETTER option but Merrill makes it simple to just roll out and it’s not to much of a hit. The more I use Merrill the better I find it to be (on desktop).

I don’t really know what the best way to hedge long term is. I might should hav won’t sold those blown up spy 375 that expire at the end fo the month but eh we’ll see",1,0,1615176846,parker2020
67,gq6dy25,That's fair. Does Merrill let you choose the legs for options? It's annoying AF that RH seems like the only broker that just let's you choose whatever retarded shit you want to buy instead of having canned strategies you *must* choose among.,1,0,1615177081,Flying_madman
