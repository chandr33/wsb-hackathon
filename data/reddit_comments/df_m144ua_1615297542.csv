71,gqbrgf2,"&gt;i hate how much the housing market is manipulated by landlords and shit like ABNB and 'investment' properties

Constraints on new builds which would drive prices down are enforced and created by governments.

Why? Turns out you are more likely to remain in office if you constrain supply so your constituents' house prices go up forever.

On top of that, central banks have lowered interest rates which results in anything purchased with credit having a price increase.

Landlords typically aren't in it for capital increases and actually are harmed when house prices go up since this increases their property tax burdens whcih offsets any gaisn they may have had from increasing rent prices due to supply ebing restricted.

Rent prices don't track house prices so most landlords would prefer stable prices and lots more newbuilds which would allow them more leverage and rental units along with lower property/council taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, why the fuck do you want to buy a house instead of rent ([https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/housing/renting-v-buying/v/renting-versus-buying-a-home](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/housing/renting-v-buying/v/renting-versus-buying-a-home))?
