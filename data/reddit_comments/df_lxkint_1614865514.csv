Like I'm somehow retarded and they can't believe I'd act so foolishly and recklessly to ""invest"" in GME. Like they are some kind of investing gurus because they have put all of their money into some ETFs (I have those too).

They've done zero research on GME, haven't read the DD, and don't have any clue what a short squeeze is. Most have never even heard of naked short selling, let alone understand it's illegal.

Everyday I get texts from concerned friends asking me if I'm getting out while GME is up, and reminding me not to be greedy. I can't wait 'til this thing pops. I'm not even going to say anything to any of them.",157,0,1614865600,throwawaycs1101
