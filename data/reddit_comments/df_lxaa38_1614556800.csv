10,gpm2w70,"Other cons: 

\- They're an iBuyer and there are already dozens of iBuyers.  Zillow has one.  There's 'Express Offers', 'Offerpad', 'RedfinNow' etc etc.  What they offer isn't that different or unique at all - super competitive space.

\- iBuyers are somehow and for some reason much more expensive than the traditional way of selling your home using an Agent.  Which is mental, because Agents are already so expensive in North America.  But instead of solving this, almost every iBuyer platform decided to make it even worse and jump on the bandwagon.  Fees are often as high as 10% and their market value for your home might be us much as 10% lower than selling traditionally.  So they're really after 'desperate' sellers.

I'd probably play as an earnings play though, especially when they were down like 10% in the tech sell-off today...",2,0,1614827850,michty6ty6
11,gpm3qt6,"The amount of homes being sold online is 1% in a 1.6Trillion dollar market where Opendoor already has the infrastructure and gaining popularity. I don't need them to be the Amazon of their sector, I just need online real estates to increase their share of the pie for OPENs share price to go north

Their service fee is 5% and closing cost is about 1%. The average fee for a traditional agent is 6-7% plus closing costs",2,0,1614828278,Natronix31
12,gpm6tkc,I read somewhere that they have much better margins than Zillow on homes sold. Hoping for earnings smash.,2,0,1614829934,I_m_a_turd
13,gpm85cl,"Yes and do you think homes sold unseen are sold at top dollar or at a discount? 

Turns out between the minimum 5% fees and the discounted price for your home, using an iBuyer costs you 10-20% (or more)!

Which is fine for people who are desperate. Or in buyers markets. 

But right now the housing market is hot - a sellers market majority across the USA.

And to most people losing 10-20%+ of the value of the biggest financial asset they own doesn't sit well. Even millenials.

That's why the number is only at 1%.

If they can fix the business model and reduce the costs I'm on board. But I've yet to see any of the iBuyers do this...

Or some kind of hybrid model with lower costs and some of the traditional real estate features but more online efficiencies.",2,0,1614830677,michty6ty6
