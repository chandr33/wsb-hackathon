I hate GME for the way it’s “fan base” responds to it. 

I’ve kept and still have a bullish GameStop position since before GameStop blew up and people started flooding the sub going crazy over it when they don’t even know what the fuck they’re doing. I can see you’ve been in since before the hype too- you’re not a part of the people obnoxiously spamming it while having no insight on it outside of just wanting to hop aboard the train.

The stupid fucks shilling it think that anyone not talking about GME shouldn’t be allowed to talk- that’s why I enjoy trolling the apes.",1,2,1615339122,WoOoOoOoShHhHh

The way you wrote that made it seem like you thought that you would have to actually buy GameStop if it finished below that. I'm also really high though. What you described, would be selling someone a put actually. If you were to sell someone a $350 put expiring 3/19, You are forced to buy 100 shares at that price if you don't remember to roll your put out a week or if you didn't use a spread.",2,0,1615339145,barelyrolling42069v2
