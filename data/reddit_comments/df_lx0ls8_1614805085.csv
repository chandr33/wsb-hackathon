48,gpl36x0,"The thing that is odd to me is that people are so angry about RKT and insisting so hard that it‚Äôs terrible. They claim they‚Äôre trying to protect people. But, in reality, even if you bought at the peak your only down about 25%. You‚Äôre still below the 52 week high, and sitting about where the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù think the stock is actually worth. The business is strong, and the mortgage market is going nuts. I just don‚Äôt see anyone getting hurt that badly on this as long as they bought shares. Worst case you take a ~25% hit to get out now, or sit on it long and most likely get everything back. 

Ironically the GME that they say people should be putting their money in hurt a LOT of people really badly before. Was nobody here a month ago? You had people buying a stock at literally 10x what it was really worth just hoping for a squeeze. While it could have a big payoff, a lot more things can go wrong to stop a squeeze than to totally tank the ‚Äúreal‚Äù value of a solid company. 

And, finally, good point about playing multiple stocks. I was heavy in GME. I pulled out a nice profit because I couldn‚Äôt deal with the stress of watching it every day. I kept some that I‚Äôll hold until the moon or eternity. I have no interest in jumping back into it like I was before, so I bought done RKT at around $35.
