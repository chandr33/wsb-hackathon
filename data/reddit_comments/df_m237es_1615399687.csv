15,gqh2c5n,"Hey guys!

Me and my buddy are writing our thesis about the ""Gamestop story"", because we really liked how reddit fucked the hedge funds.

We made a small survey (max 5 min.) to get some data we can analyse. If you could complete it, we would be very thankful!

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeG4wR3TOn5V-ngFzGL-QuQ2DF2aPgsYtDeYzTCRgLP6O71NA/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeG4wR3TOn5V-ngFzGL-QuQ2DF2aPgsYtDeYzTCRgLP6O71NA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

The survey is completely anonymous and your answers will be kept confidential! We know it contains some sensitive questions, if you don't want to share those with us, we respect that.

Please don't hate us, we are just 2 random dude trying to understand the underlying factors behind the GME craze and get a good grade for our thesis, and also HOLD GME TO THE MOON!

Your help is highly appreciated! Have a nice day and high returns!",-5,0,1615399689,csan00
