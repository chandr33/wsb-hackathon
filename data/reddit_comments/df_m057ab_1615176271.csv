I actually joined reddit years ago but rarely posted. 

I began day trading last year and after learning of gme, I decided to use a new username for my trading related posts, having no idea about the 'rules' for new users on some subreddits.

Like I said, I rarely posted so gimme a break.

But I finally start posting because I'm engaged now, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.

In 2019, the year my daughter was born, her dad walked out on us. I had a little bit of cash from my job and messed around on RH, bought a bunch of random shares I could afford with names I recognized. GME happened to be one of them. Started learning and also paying attention to the stock subs on Reddit, including WSB. It was a fun thing I could do while taking care of my baby. It made my life a lot less lonely. By 2020 I was actually doing pretty well with returns on some of my tiny shares (one was BILI and it exploded)! Held GME in 2021 because of what I was seeing on WSB. Not because anyone gave me financial advice, but because I decided that was what I wanted to do. Bought a little bit more at a time with fractional shares but took out what I originally put in on the way up just to be safe. At the end of January, when they stopped allowing us to buy GME, I found a bunch of ETFs that include it in their portfolios and put a little bit of money in each. All of which is to say: I’m in it for the tendies, and fuck every news story that has come out disparaging WSB. They have no idea about this sub.

90,gq96vm9,"&gt;A margin call is one example. Investors who have borrowed money to buy shares find themselves forced to sell – at exactly the wrong moment, and at a loss – if their share price falls too far below its collateral value. 
Forced selling is familiar. But is there such a thing as forced buying? 
Yes. There are several situations in which a market participant has very little option but to buy shares, and often at a highly disadvantageous price. Cornering these forced buyers and feasting off their distress is another one of the ancient arts of the marketplace. 

Nobody ""forced"" these turds to short Gamestonk in the first place.
