1,gqamn2s,Yeah DISCA has really run hard and I‚Äôm not sure why now. Not just them (presumably because of their Discovery + service) but also Viacom and the AMCX. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Almost bought puts today but didn‚Äôt because this market has been insanely unpredictable.,2,0,1615264637,fastnlite
2,gqamq8r,You realize you're feeding the short busters ammo right? This stock has 28% SI and they'll want to squeeze it.,1,0,1615264694,TiredCr0codile
3,gqamw76,Each contract is around $6000? (Still learning),1,0,1615264800,NOKIASTONK
4,gqanbzg,"I bought DISCA about two months or so ago. I noticed Michael Burry had a fair bit so I said fuck it. It‚Äôs printed nicely. Something told me to sell today, but i paper hand often lol so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a sign. The stock is heavily shorted too. I still wouldn‚Äôt put puts on it. I dunno why but DISCA just keeps moving up",1,0,1615265081,neox29

6,gqap5ib,"Right, so net \~$16 MM of profit realized right? My impression was he exercised the options to gain 474,601 shares, then sold all of those shares. This isn't that clear to me still as I can't see what options he has and his full position.",1,0,1615266288,Dat_Speed

The reason for this is taxes; you usually want to sell the older shares (which fall under long term capital gains), and replace them with the new shares from exercising the option.

35,gqbivml,""" I spend about 100 hours a week checking stocks every day and was wondering why DISCA""  


100 hours and you didnt discover that they announced Discovery plus? (pun not intended) and that they licensed their huge library of quality content to Disney plus (previously only monetised by selling to cable companies)?

at points in the lifespan of entertainment business, power shifted from cinema to TV channels to cable companies to streaming services, now it is shifting back to content owners and makers as they go direct to consumer, giving a big shaft to netflix, hulu and the like.   


So DIS, DISCA, VIACOMA and others are flying.. because they anounced their own streaming services. they are now flying as the valuation model and comparatives are changed to match streaming/tech companies like netflix, in this comparison they are still dirt cheap.. im invested in all three and ill write a DD about this stuff since no one seems to be the wiser of whats going on here...",1,0,1615292340,madbank123
