64,gqfdo2e,"Sorry but this part is factually incorrect.
&gt;the reason IPOs go uppp on the first day trading is because the banks that carry the companies through the deal are incentivized to make the IPO price as low as possible so they get the most money from the process. 

Banks get a percentage of the total money raised in the IPO. They definitely have an incentive to get the highest possible price per share as that increases the amount raised.

*However*, the reason you see first day pops from the likes of Airbnb and Doordash are a combination of

1. Wall Street has no idea how to price tech companies. 

2. Wall Street is giving out favors to their best clients (investors) in which they earn the most fees from. They know that the price will pop on the first day, so they let these investors get in at the IPO price, and those investors can flip their shares on the first day immediately for XX% profit as the stock trades up.

The second reason is why a lot of tech companies want to skip the traditional IPO process, and list directly. Spotify, Slack, and now Roblox. The Roblox CEO even said this was one of the main reasons he wanted to do a DPO.",1,0,1615365475,bananainbeijing

67,gqfek2a," Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:   
&gt;  
&gt;1) $45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
&gt;  
&gt; 2) They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?   
&gt;  
&gt;3) They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
&gt;  
&gt;What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.
