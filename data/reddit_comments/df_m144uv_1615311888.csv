I know this is WSB and all but I can't say I don't feel bad for the people who well didn't really know what they're getting into, especially since it's the marginally less blind leading the blind. If you see ""300% shorted hedgies are fucked"" on a daily basis and have no clue that the number is basically an outright lie, you might believe some crazy price targets. Especially with everyone just repeating it as fact.

I don't think people know just how much risk is involved. The options writers do, us unpinneds do, but the 8 million people who found WSB via Twitter or CNBC? I doubt they do.

Like idk, I don't like people losing their shirt and I know a lot of people will. And while I like loss porn as much as anyone, most of the people who would post it have a somewhat decent understanding of the significant risks involved.",1,0,1615322871,justcool393

I've seen talks of value plays, those are going to be the ones who realized that the squeeze squoze almost two months ago now. Some of them are still convinced that somehow holding will hurt hedge funds, but I don't think *any* of them quite know why that would be the case. 

In reality, my thesis is that they've killed liquidity. There's still some demand, but it's mostly the same few shares being traded back and forth since a *lot* of them are locked up in diamond hands. It's why you are able to get random explosive movements, but I don't think they realize the kind of fire they're playing with. If demand ever dries up or someone big decides to take profits, expect a *massive* drop out of nowhere. I have no idea when that will happen, but I reckon it will.
