17,gqfyif3,"Last I heard, those dumbasses were closing their US factories:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-chips-cpu-factory-outsourcing-semiconductor-manufacturing-11604605618

Most of their factories are overseas (east Asia including mainland china), anyways.

And with China on control of the raw material supply chain, a US factory would have the same problems, until we are able to shift the supply domestically too, which will take time.

Is their way to invest into US domestic rare earth production?  I know the mountain pass mine opened back up in California, but I don't think it's runs by a public company.",1,0,1615382889,Midnight2012
