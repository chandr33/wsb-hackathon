As $800 creeps closer, the MMs will start to buy shares, slowly at first, but more frantically soon after.

They need to cover nearly 5 million shares for $800 strike ALONE, even if they would think it only 1% likely to hit $800 this week, that's still 50,000 shares, that's quite a lot of buying pressure!
