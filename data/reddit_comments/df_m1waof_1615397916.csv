Anybody who is telling you that is full of shit, and is probably one of the demoralized, lazy crabs at the bottom of the bucket trying to keep you trapped with them.

The ladder looks different today than it did in the past, but it's not gone.  Just develop a useful skill that someone will pay you for (e.g. not history or gender studies), don't be stupid with your money (i.e. don't take out huge loans for a useless degree), and don't have kids until you're in a position to take care of them.

I bought in at $250/share the first time around (had seen it bounce up from $250 to $300+ a few times, so figured I'd get in - but it only went up to $258 and then went straight down lol). If it had just dropped to $220/share and hovered around that for a while I probably would have started to get nervous and wonder ""should I just cut my losses now? So I don't lose even more?""

But when it fell to $150, $80, $50, $40... I was like ""well fuck, no point in selling at an 84% loss. Might as well just hold and see what happens."" And sure enough, y'all came back to get me. Much appreciated!",1,0,1615400677,ZeekLTK

They might be able to pull this off a time or two but eventually the algos will figure it out and then the fun is over.
