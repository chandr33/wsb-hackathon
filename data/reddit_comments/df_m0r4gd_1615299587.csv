28,gqdqiyy,"I'm in it to win it, though I added to my position in uwmc because yesterday was the last day for dividends and I'm long on it. Closed all my other positions though. I'm not nearly as well off as some of our apes, but I make good money in a nice, low COL area on the Florida Gulf Coast.

This is unfortunate timing for me since I bought a house at the end of 2019, replaced all the appliances, the AC system, the roof, etc. I would have had more capital to throw in if not for that. Now, I'm thinking full interior remodel, landscaping, and turn my back yard into a pool/spa paradise with a swim up bar and outdoor billiard and my office needs a simpit and a megacade.

All the better to do that on the bears' dime as I diamond dick through the cosmos.",1,0,1615328616,HedonismandTea
29,gqdtaxn,"I couldn't tell if you were serious or not and figured somebody else might answer but here we are 17 hours later and nothing. Just in case you are in the dark on this, there's ""pull-out"" couches that open up into a bed. After a few moves, or some retard closing it with a bunch of shit in there the metal frame tends to bend and sometimes it's very difficult to get the bed portion to pull out from inside the couch.

Now this joke is usually used for a man that has a bunch of kids, and I have 4 between two different women so I'm definitely motivated because these crotch goblins are expensive af. In the context I've used it in here the joke works on many levels. I'm no paper hands and I'm YOLO in at an alarming extent in regards to my finances, so I'm not pulling out of GME. I'm not pulling out of being balls deep in hedgie ass, etc. Like a broken couch. Hope this clears it up, brother.
