41,gpp8etb,"After the events of the GME squeeze, chaos ensues. The previously rich and wealthy squander all their resources to try  and maintain a semblance of their previous wealth and power, but too many millionaires have been created. They rise up, and the population soon realizes that as the bullshit top-down system no longer works at all. Everyone is quitting their jobs as the US dollar rapidly declines and the entire economy collapses.

The enemies of the US see this and go to war with you guys. Nuclear war. The world is decimated.

Enter Snowpiercer. The sole ark of salvation built by us, the apes, to save humanity as the world crumbled apart. The only way maintenance is done is by having a small person -- someone very small about the size of an oompa loompa -- go into the small shafts in the train.  Unfortunately, all of the oompa loompas have now died off, and we have to use children to keep the trains running.

Years pass. No one knows who really built these trains and why. We know. We inherited Wonka's wealth. We innovated and became inventors like him. Most of the world is now dead and the only ones alive are those who chose to follow us, the apes, the ones who held on and were rewarded by Mr. Wonka.",21,0,1614893197,DisgruntledCatGuy
