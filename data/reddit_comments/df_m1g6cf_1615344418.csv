95,gqel34h,"I HIGHLY regret not buying at $40. I thought it was all over. I wish I could go back in time and put in $5,000 or more, it obviously would have been well worth it.

Now I have a measly 10 shares that I bought at $160. I regret listening to all of the ‚Äúfinancial professionals‚Äù saying to stay away from GME.

I have shitty employment, and less than a year before I probably can‚Äôt afford health insurance and the medicine withdrawal may kill me, possibly even literally.

I also am just not looking forward to a lifetime of working 40+ hours a week, it‚Äôs a huge waste of life, and I‚Äôve never gotten to enjoy life much.

I believe everyone saying to stay away from GME just wants to keep the rich rich, and the poor poor (especially if they are very wealthy hedge fund managers, who lose money when you make money).

Other people are just ignorant of how GME works.

I should have put a lot more of my savings in at $40, I should havd listened to all of you saying it would go up, but instead I listened to the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù.

I could have made $30, $40, maybe even $50,000 before the end of the year! Possibly much more! Then I could finally start my fucking life and be left alone from people when I want to be alone!

I‚Äôm afraid GME might honestly be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Playing it safe has done nothing but hold me back in life. You only get ahead in life by taking risks. 

There has to be more opportunities to make a good 5-6 figures BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, RIGHT?????

EVEN AMC IS GOING UP FFS!!!!!! I only have 10 of those too though.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been given shitty ‚Äúadvice‚Äù from multiple people.
