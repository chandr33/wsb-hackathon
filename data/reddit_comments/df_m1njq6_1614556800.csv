In the short term, there is no catalyst to cause UWMC to run; its been trading down for months, rates are increasing, everyone is predicting a cooling market, and they just announced they are going to war with RKT. Its bad all around.

78,gqf3quw,"I had a bunch of links as I was doing research on RKT and UWMC, but I can't find them right now. But I found a couple via google:

""Like Rocket, UWM is having a big couple of years as borrowers take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Loan origination volume grew from $42 billion in 2018 to $108 billion last year, and is projected to hit $200 billion in 2020. The company‚Äôs net income went from $67 million in 2018 to $303 million in 2019 and it expects to earn $2.1 billion this year. Company projections are for origination volume to hit $240 billion in 2022 while earnings slip to $1.8 billion.

Ishbia is bullish not only on UWM‚Äôs ability to grow its market share, but also on the growth of the wholesale mortgage business as a whole‚Äîespecially once rock-bottom interest rates begin to rise. The company forecasts the wholesale channel‚Äôs share of the overall mortgage market growing to 33% by 2026, up from 20% in 2019 and 15% in 2016. While the current low-interest rate-driven boom in refis has been a boon for mortgage originators, Ishbia says UWM is poised to succeed as rate-sensitive refinance business dies down and home buyers seek out brokers for help obtaining a mortgage.

Currently they have around 35% percent of mortgage brokers, I think they grew from 32 in 2019, and something like 28 in 2018. If I find my original research I will link it.

There was a industry analysis I had a link to but can't find it right now:

https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fastest-growing-mortgage-brokerages-part-1-of-2/


I haven't spoken to a real estate agent yet, but the impression I have been getting from reading CEO interviews is:

UWMC CEO is more slow and focused (one segement at a time),
while RKT CEO is agressive and wants to expand within multiple areas at the same time. 

If the industry contracts due to rising interest rates, both will need to be aggressive in taking market share. Not neccesarily from each other, but the smaller fish.",1,0,1615356553,bakamito

UWMC is going into the 1000 (large cap) group. 

https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion

&gt; Because the indexes are capitalization-weighted, there is relatively little index buying when a firm enters the Russell 1000 as one of the smallest firms, but there is non-trivial buying when a firm joins the Russell 2000 as one of the index's largest capitalized firms.

&gt; In contrast to past S&amp;P 500 studies, the authors also found a deletion effect for stocks whose market capitalization bumped them up from the heavily-traded top echelon of the Russell 2000 to the less heavily traded bottom of the Russell 1000.
