2,gqg9v0o,"I tend to agree with this sentiment. 

But then again, this is what I thought about PTON back in March. Not making that mistake again. Never doubt beckys and chads to need to buy $27 Nike “pro” socks.",1,0,1615388647,ConBroMitch

7,gqgfe3a,Facts! They’ve been struggling with sales.. they’ve begun offering a 20% coupon for students off literally anything a couple weeks back. Not a good sign considering the youth are their prime demographic.,2,0,1615391069,jmaldana7
8,gqgjsgf,"I believe Nike will beat earnings expectations and provide great guidance because everything is reopening. Currently is is about 8% away from their 52 week high and they beat the last 2 earnings estimates and the stock price gapped up. The Nike outlet and shoes stores have been packed for a few months in the city I live in. The non-GAAP estimate for next earnings is $0.76, which I believe is low. I think a straddle or strangle strategy is the safest bet on Nike earnings.",1,0,1615392821,Creamcheesecumking

11,gqim9wz,They sell out every Jordan Signature and every Dunk within five minutes of release.  People are buying and hoarding Nike shoes.  The sales VP and her son just got caught in a massive reselling scandal.  I wouldn’t  say humans aren’t buying shoes.,2,0,1615425163,Murder_Ders

15,gqnuiat,"it would be the worst time to buy nike puts imo… Nike direct sales have increased tremendously which increased profit margin. Their shoes are still selling out and you literally won’t be able to buy them if you don’t have bots… Don’t forget how much disposable income people have received during the pandemic and people buy casual comfortable clothing working from home. Where you are spending those disposable income and stimmy cheques? Do you need to do more home work out because you don’t walk out of your house anymore? Nike hoodies/sweaters/sweatpants are sold out and re-stocked 1000 times online. Most importantly Nike has been a BIGGGG hit in China and Japan recently years with increasing sales, keep in mind that those countries did not get affected by the pandemic too much. Lastly, guidance is the key. Everything are going to re-open so even they miss earnings, it’s not gonna go down.",1,0,1615527774,chiggaroni
