I also heard that because it‚Äôs not IPO they will get more of the cash as opposed to degenerates like us, as it‚Äôs likely more accurately valued from the outset.

Page 12 they tripled paying developers exchange fees despite not tripling revenue. 

Also they pay 30% of revenue to Apple /whatever App Store they are on (I think that‚Äôs the cost of revenue line). Which is doubled 

Doubled R&amp;D, almost doubled infrastructures/trust /safety line. 

Basically they are caught in a hard rock of paying developers 30%, App Store 30%, and expand their game /security (paramount to a kids game) which doesn‚Äôt leave them a ton room as long as they pay 60% to whatever they charge to others. 

I so wanted to be in on this but after doing some light reading (the link above is only 200 pages and not all needs to be read) I think I‚Äôll wait on the side lines and watch this week and maybe dabble in 1-10 shares /options for giggles.

81,gqg8jyd,Rblx is on Robinhood now. Here's the problem because I had this same problem with doordash. It will let you buy now well enter the maximum prove your willing to pay and if it goes up and you say 45. You won't even get a share. That is unless you put an absurd price. Best bet would be let it come out and wait a few and see where it levels out at before deciding to buy in because chances are its gonna bounce around slot buying and selling. Then find a nice comfy floor. But so what you want. I tried to buy dd when it ipo and didn't even get any because the price kept jumping up higher than my max ask. And it just bounced around all day.
