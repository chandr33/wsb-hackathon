10,gqgtsw5,"I feel your pain. I had 4 shares, 4.20 to be exact @ $40. Missed the sell on the ðŸš€ when it was up around $400 the first time then it tanked because of all the manipulation. Sold 2 shares off around $120 each to get my initial $200 back. Then sat on 2 shares as the whatever bonus. Sold those yesterday at $250 so I made a profit of $500 plus my original $200 back. Now it's $345 and I could have had an extra $100. Oh well. If it cracks $600 I'll cry but I just couldn't handle this gambling and waiting anymore I just wanted to be done with it. It's not like it's the volume where it's a $25,000 difference between selling yesterday and today. As the famous JG Wentworth once said, it's my money and I want it now. And honestly that $500 I made is a nice help right now and I'm glad I didn't miss it.",2,0,1615396772,the1999person
