2,gpja5kg,The issue here is that every other major offshore driller has entered Chapter 11 in the past 12 months &amp; will emerge with almost no debt. This allows them to bid on the same contracts with a lot more flexibility,10,0,1614781065,Hogey_37

11,gpjfq3v,"Agreed, with this writeup on $RIG!

Price movement up from $0.67 to almost $4 is the market finally rewarding them for a solid debt restructuring, one of the best backlogs in the industry, a victory over a failed lawsuit against them, and an inflationary trade with oil.

$RIG has room to continue to run",6,0,1614783724,NoteLeather1822
12,gpjga2v,Lol glad to hear this is potentially turning around I still have 5 shares from when I bought an entire lot at 44 back like 10years when I had even less of an idea what I was doing lol hope you're right I may even throw money at this and burn it again. Maybe 2nd time is the charm,6,0,1614783981,veryuniqueredditname

24,gpjzkw1,"How is WTI doing relative to RIG? Up from $0.67 last year, 20% over the last month. How does the common person play WTI? Should they buy the ETF and risk getting crushed on the roll? Please provide some solutions, We are all ears!

Seems like you are very selective in the data you chose to regurgitate, with a negative spin.",2,0,1614792362,NoteLeather1822
25,gpk3sv5,"&gt;debt

You may be right but in the meantime RIG is actively working through its backlog, looking to enter into new contracts, restructuring its debt to push out duration, and the stock price is being rewarded for that. 

Competitors will be dealing with restructuring for some time and the boats not waiting at the dock for them",5,0,1614794156,NoteLeather1822

28,gpo7cjt,"Sorry I missed this yesterday but RIG is my YOLO play. Long several thousand shares from around $2. It's a call option on the price of oil with zero theta. I don't have a price target, but it's not unreasonable to project it trading three digits again. Wouldn't happen for a few years, but double digits this year is quite possible.",3,0,1614877623,xkulp8
