2,gqiwncq,"I am requesting the maximum amount I can ask for for 2 reasons.

1: The order is in early, should the stock price reach my ask via squeeze, anomaly, accident, really any reason. 

2: My shares will be unavailable for loaning to hedge funds.

This is my decision and not financial advice. It would be a strange anomoly if everyone suddenly did the same.",1,0,1615430558,atrivell
3,gqiwpuz,What brokerage are you going through that let's you set sell limits that high?,2,0,1615430595,Madcat41
4,gqiwx7h,"I'm using RBC in Canada. I put the order in after hours, and it will most likely be rejected. I'll continue to lower it until I find the maximum. I hear every broker is different unless I misunderstand that.",1,0,1615430701,atrivell

6,gqjopcj,"I called Rbc and waited for 2 fucken hours to ask them a couple Qs and they donâ€™t lend your shares in a TFSA account.

I have also set my sell limit as a joke a week or two ago when we jumped from 50 to 90 and it accepted it in AH but rejected it in the morning.",1,0,1615447404,datbf4
7,gqjqncq,"I just thought many other people hear with all kinds of different brokers would like to know what I am doing with my shares. That includes a lot of people who are not with RBC, and not on cash accounts.

Not financial advice.",1,0,1615448729,atrivell
