75,gqgbil8,"Well they weren't exactly transparent as to what happened, and we don't know if they were margin called, or if they were merely following the rules of their hedge fund to cut losses at prespecified position. They could have very well just hit a liquidity trap where they couldn't afford to keep the lights on, and the condition of getting Citadel's investment could have required them to exit the position on GME rather than use Citadel's money to keep playing their $0 short target. 

In any event, the gamma squeeze didn't preclude any of these scenarios. It was the gamma squeeze that spiked the borrow rate to as high as 70% at one point, and likely forced Melvin out regardless of the exact mechanics of Melvin's exit. Given the timing of Melvin's announcement, its entirely possible they exited when the price was still around 120-150 on the Tuesday, which is similar to the effect of the February gamma squeeze that drove from roughly 60-170. What we're seeing right now after that gamma squeeze is an entirely different scenario than when Melvin's likely exit of their short position was the Wednesday pop to 498. 

Once Melvin exited their short, all the shares that had been returned to the lender got dumped, which was the massive climb down (i.e. the proverbial short ladder attack) that Wednesday. We saw similar behavior after the February gamma squeeze, but now it appears that hedge funds or at least large day traders have been playing with multi-million dollar long plays on the back of that gamma squeeze.",1,0,1615389389,BackgroundSearch30
