47,gqh8hbq,One thing that can explain this is if say someone or some group has been hoarding large amounts of actual or borrowed shares and sold everything at 340 at the same time. The sell triggered people's stop-losses and created more sell orders. That's how you can crash a stock by \~200 a share in minutes.,2,0,1615402091,ryaichu

80,gqh8ho8,"NO THIS IS NOT THR CASE. Thank you for asking, everyone seems to think this. This is not the case. Haults are normal things that happen when the stock goes up or down too fast over a short period of time. This is to prevent trading on emotion. What Robinhood and other brokerages did was stop buying of GME for 24 hours and then later restricted buying, selling was allowed.
