3,gqe2wqc,"I though about this when AMC was hanging, but I've made money back then with AMC on the first ""little queeze"" so this time I went in again to ride this massive squeeze.

What I find weird is that AMC have such a potential for a hugh percentage growth and not much people talks about it.
