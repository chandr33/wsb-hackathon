17,gqglatm,"Crazy to look back at the first GME rally in late January and remember the volatility. The day we hit almost $500, GME opened at $265, hit a low of $112, and closed at $193.60.

22,gqglaun,"There are big sell orders at every milestone so there's always resistance. Whenever the price is over the milestone the sell orders are activated and causes the price to go down.

The orders will only go through if the price is over 300 so the longer it's there the more orders go through.

Once all sell orders are completed there's a big takeoff as the number of buy orders is higher than sell orders so the price is driven higher",2,0,1615393395,ConsentingInsomniac
