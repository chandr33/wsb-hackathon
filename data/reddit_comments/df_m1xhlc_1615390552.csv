18,gqge7u8,"Can I just take a moment to say that above learned more about the actual stock market since January than I have in the entire preceding year. As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didn’t sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, 💎💎🤲🏼, we’re coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life. 

And here you all come, like a group of toddlers riding the short bus, and you picked me up from my corner, lunch box with a single banana in hand. And we kept driving 

So now, 300+ gang. Believe me, the short bus is coming for you. The tendie man cometh. 


Edit: sorry for the above, my 3 year old grabbed my phone and just started typing. Anyways, I have no idea what all that means up there, I have no financial advice to give, I just like putting my money in places that make me feel good. And I like this place. 💎💎🤲🏼🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝💫✨",60,0,1615390557,halflistic_
