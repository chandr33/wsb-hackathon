Think it shouldn't be underestimated the potential catalysts of GameStop as a company breaking their silence. They‚Äôre stretching it out to maximize the potential, or just want to time the announcements and catalysts right to maximize this. It‚Äôs totally in GameStop‚Äôs hands, the same is true for announcing dividends that would completely fuck the short positions. I think a stock split for example could be impactfull move for new CFO.

Bottom line I'm not 100% evident this will blow past 1k, as this is still a bet just  on WSB just playing out well so far the past weeks.

It might not be orchestrated in Reddit as a HF could organize exact planned pressure for triggering squeeze.
