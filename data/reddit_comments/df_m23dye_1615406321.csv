27,gqhlmdn,"It kept dropping over the course of \~23 minutes, smashing through multiple circuit breakers in seconds on the way down. That and also, if it were a single institution, why would they intentionally sell at a 50% loss from what it literally was just minutes before? If you look at the volume, it clearly ramps up as the event unfolded. If I were a single institution looking to dump shares, I'd drop them all at one price, trickle them out, or at least have a floor where I wouldn't sell below that. There could be the argument that a bunch of stop losses were triggered, but there has to be something different about that that caused a ridiculous plunge rather than a bit of a droop like we've seen every other time.",1,0,1615407616,djentonaut
