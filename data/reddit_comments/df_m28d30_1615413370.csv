97,gqhz964,"&gt; HF have an upper hand because in the short term it‚Äôs cheaper to short than buy stock

HF have the upper hand because they are controlling the price of every ticker on the market. Full stop. But on top of that, it is objectively more expensive to short a stock since it's cost is Price of borrowed share + interest. Which is why most short trades are momentum trades that are closed out intraday. 

&gt; They also have order flow info (so they know stop losses)

This information is not hard to find for free, and most pleb services offer it outside of RH. This isn't a unique feature only HF's have and it certainly isn't their ""big stick"".

&gt; can be coordinated (unlike retail) 

They're not coordinating, they just have more money than WSB. It's simple math. 

&gt; and can time when to short to trigger stop losses (not hard to predict halts).

Except for the fact that the halt was a *reaction* to the sold shares. They didn't short it right before a predicted halt, they literally caused it by flooding a highly volatile stock with a fuck load of market sell orders.

&gt; Apes advantage is that there‚Äôs a cult around the stock &amp; their loss is capped at their investment.

Nope, apes have 0 advantage. In fact, HF's only *real* advantage is that the 'apes' will do anything to maintain the belief that they are the ones in control, despite 0 evidence pointing in that direction.
