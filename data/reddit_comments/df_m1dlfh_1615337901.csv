94,gqebyw3,"Did some research on this, as I've personally seen the CRA come after people for millions. It's likely they'll claim you're using your TFSA as a business because of the ""speculative nature"" of the stock. 

Found a fun little piece of tax legislation which pretty much says Trudeau is coming for our tendies. 

Subsection 146.2(6) provides that if a TFSA ‚Äúcarries on one or more businesses,‚Äù then ‚Äútax is payable under this Part [part I] by the trust on the amount that would be its taxable income for the taxation year if it had no incomes or losses from sources other than those businesses.‚Äù 

The CRA confirmed its position that ‚Äúspeculative transactions‚Äù (unofficial translation) carried on by an RRSP, RRIF, or TFSA may amount to the operation of a business by the deferred plan, resulting in the income from such business being subject to income tax.

The CRA has yet to publish guidelines on what is meant by ‚Äúcarrying on business‚Äù in relation to these kinds of plans, but the factors used in recent TFSA audits appear to be the same as those listed in paragraph 11 of¬†Interpretation Bulletin¬†IT-479R (‚ÄúTransactions in Securities,‚Äù February 29, 1984): frequency of transactions, period of ownership, knowledge of securities markets, security transactions forming a part of the taxpayer‚Äôs ordinary business, time spent, advertising, and the speculative nature of the securities involved. The CRA‚Äôs audit project does not appear to be restricted to TFSAs engaged in day trading.

I doubled down and am considering that cost to be my capital gains taxes, not the subsequent tendies which will be lost as a result. Hurts less to think of it that way.",1,0,1615339635,ignorance4bliss
