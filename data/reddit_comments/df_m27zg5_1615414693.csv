85,gqi21s8,"See if your brokerage is set up for trailing stop orders and conditional orders.  

What I did is set up a conditional order (one order triggers the next) combining a trailing stop loss with a trailing buy order.

How it works is I set the trailing number for the sell to $50. If the price ever drops to $50 below the market high, it sells my shares.  As the market high for the stonk increases, the sell price increases with it.  On a big plunge ($50) the sale order kicks in.  And THAT triggers my trailing buy order which says anytime there is movement up $5 from the current market price, it will buy the shares back. Since it's a trailing buy order, if the price keeps dropping, the buy price keeps dropping with it, always waiting for it to bounce $5 above the bottom.

I'm sure I'll figure out a way to really mess this up, but it seems to be working so far.
