35,gpksgmn,"Good find. I checked out there design on their website. It's definitely the most similar bed I've found but twice the price. The gel material they use is an existing polymer used for baby pacifiers, and other things. Reminds me of Dr. Scholl's gel. I have no idea if it's a superior bed or not but it's pretty significant that I was doing quite a bit of bed research before I bought Purple's bed. Even searching lists like ""Top 10 most comfortable beds"" and that bed never came up nor have I heard of it till now. This alone makes my think Purple has a HUGE head start from the marketing standpoint. I saw that Intellibed is sold in Mattress Firm locations so they are more of a brick and mortar purchase. Hence the higher price. This is also where I see Purple dominating. As a fellow owner you know how easy it was to order a Purple bed and set it up. It's crazy to think in a few years that there will still be mattress stores that require delivery drivers and trucks to bring it to your house when Purple just FedEx's a giant purple tubes to anyone's door for free shipping at half the price.",5,0,1614804812,dema9o9ue
