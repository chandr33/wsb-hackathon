But we are still here and are bouncing back. 

I will not be surprised if we end the day around $350. 

This kind of attacks are nothing new and are to bring panic in the market and hit the stop loss limits. I saw couple times attack like this on Tesla. But at the end all these short attacking hedge funds lost billions. If we buy and hold nobody will able to destroy the stock price.
