I've only got 34 shares now down from 143 at one point. Made a pretty penny on the way up. Might buy more might not. Tell you what though I'm pissed at myself for getting rid of my $12 call option today when it was diving like a bat out of hell.",1,0,1615353070,AcesHidden

The reason should never be out of panic. If you believe the companies will rebound just by looking at their charts, there is no reason to exit. You don't lose money until you exit.

I wouldn't hail mary on GME just to cover your losses. I'm all in for the squeeze potential but I got in @ 139. You *could* still profit if you invest tomorrow, but just my personal investing strategy would be to research more about trading and find your risk tolerance level and strategies that suit your personality.",2,0,1615353155,petitehughie
