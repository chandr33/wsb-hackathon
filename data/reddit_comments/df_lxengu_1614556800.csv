1,gpmn969,"Well yes, or there is a 50% chance it might continue climbing to new ATHs.
DCA-ing into good quality stocks is never wrong. Some old boomer stocks actually have great fundamentals",5,0,1614840933,ScienceFreak11

4,gpmnttf,The folks panicking now probably weren't trading this time last year so they haven't been through a real correction.,26,0,1614841416,JRMang
5,gpmnyve,You act like the correction is over. It is probably just the beginning. Once fear sets in we could see a large correction.,7,0,1614841535,lvreddit1077
6,gpmnz3c,I just put 25k into... Proctor and Gamble. Makes me wanna fall asleep just thinking about how boring that stock is.. but its a good boomer stock thats very oversold right now even after great earnings/2021 growth forecast last month,4,0,1614841540,Thetagamer
7,gpmo3ae,Ok a year ago it was at $222 but not everyone got in at that price.,2,0,1614841636,Kamjiang
8,gpmoi12,"I definitely don't think this correction is over, but I also don't understand why people are panicking over a 2-5% dip. 

Thought it'd be good to put into context how far we've come from the 2020 lows. A 20% dip honestly isn't much. Good to take some profits off the table, and reload and reenter if and when the markets dip.",4,0,1614841982,ScienceFreak11

10,gpmomsz,Yes. I panik sold Feb2020 and missed on a shitload of gains. I guess i will DCA back in after pandemic is over.,1,0,1614842095,Imaginary-Jaguar662

15,gpmqvqp,"Seriously.  People don‚Äôt know panic until you have a 2008 style market meltdown.  I‚Äôd invest money in the morning and by the evening, my portfolio would be down 3x the money I just put in.  Now imagine that everyday for a year ü§£

A lot of the noobs have only known a bull market, since the market has only gone up since the Great Recession and the bear market last year was the shortest in history",13,0,1614844054,stockboi81

Buy TSY? Lol",0,0,1614844544,tokin_jew
17,gpmt17y,"All of history combined?? Including the depression and recession? Oh hush, bond yields are freaking out and there are inflationary worries bc of it. But bc the fed is being dovish and not simply stepping in to raise I-rates and this reverse this inflationary fear, when this fear subsides is up for speculation. 

One thing I have realized though is that bubbles in the past have reasons. Dot com boom - valueless companies being being traded at ridiculous share prices. Recession - subprime mortgage lending. While we def do have some exorbitant P/E ratios for stocks, many of these companies are well established and will continue to profit in the long run. Nothing like bubbles of the past. 

In the interim, switch some of your portfolio to industrials while the market figures its shit out. 

Def not an all out bubble though my dude. Lol...this guy üòÇ",5,0,1614846016,mr_anderson59
18,gpmt686,"You assume all of this is panic selling, but has it occured to you that big money may be shifting around? Or that people are leveraged to the tits, and are being force to sell cause of margin calls?
