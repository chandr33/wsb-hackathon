8,gpmmxqj,"Well this just simply isn’t true. The problems EV is having right now have nothing to do with the manufacturing of chips. It has everything to do with rising bond yields and fears of inflation. 

I don’t see bond yields receding. They should be getting higher as we get closer to reopening and another round of stim tbh. I also don’t see the Fed stepping in any time soon to change its dovish stance on I-rates. 

So the market might just have to “get used” to these treasury yields trading higher. I think eventually it will...but without the fed stepping in to raise interest rates, when this will happen is very speculative...",3,0,1614840666,mr_anderson59
