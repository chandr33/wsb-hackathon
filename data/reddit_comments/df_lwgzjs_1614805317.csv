8,gpl6mv4,"I'm not 100% what you're asking.

OTM=out the money=this option is ""losing"" money
ITM=in the money=this option is ""making"" money.

Anyone can sell options. If you hold enough shares; you can customize it. Or, you can sell options you've bought.

So, when you're looking at options to buy you're seeing both people who hold the shares(for calls) offering them, and people who bought those and are now selling them.

So, I.E. I have an option expiring on 3/5: it's made me 1500 so I'm happy: I want my money. But, besides the stock value it has extrinsic value from the time left on the option. So, I sell my option for my 1500(it's literal worth) plus maybe a little extra for the time left for someone else who hopes it goes higher.

If I'm having a bad day and selling my options that are OTM; I'm trying to get some of my investment back while the the value of it's remaining time is still left; versus spinning the wheel myself on how it all ends.
If you come in, buy that on a discount essentially, and the stock shoots up; you made money.

I hope that answers what I think you were asking. It's not really important, at this level, who is selling the options.",2,0,1614811109,TechnicianPlenty

You can quickly lose a ton of money fast.

Typically your goal with selling options is to make a little bit of money relatively safely. Think of it as being the casino. If you start a casino with 1,000 dollars you could lose it all in a bad game and be done. If you have 500,000 dollars stats are on your side and you can absorb short term losses.",2,0,1614824091,TechnicianPlenty

25,gpm4txk,"lol it can be verified if you just look at whats being shown people do their own DD if theyre serious and with the rise in members and communities they can figure out things together. Many apes strong together. Choose to believe what you want but do your own DD if you cant comprehend whats being shown and the math behind it. Its not a meme when its possible its spammed because of that reason. Hedgefunds can run their own tests as well their programmers and coders, rising jobs in this field that pay absurd. Are you one of those that would deny the change in tech you think this is a meme do you think tesla was a meme when it was nothing now its all this craze and leading. 

Do your own DD with whats being shown thats all instead of believing things arent possible when they are. We want people to hold and to understand GME is showing how manipulated the stock market is and how all this will cause crashes and changes within the market. Spam 100k not a meme because we want everyone to see and to hold, we always say hold hodl never sell only buy. Still being shorted and price shoots up thats why diamond hands is a meme along with paper hands. The thing is though those are pretty much real terms of just people who are scared to see how this is all possible so they get out. The ones that hold know 100k is not a meme.",0,0,1614828847,SpooksMaGooks

29,gpmufsi,"yeah, but still its a bit high. Are you still long on RKT or did you get out and avoid the tumble today? I am likely to hold at least through the dividend date. I figure it might have some volatility, especially with the Nasdaq in so much red recently.",1,0,1614847365,SebastianPatel
30,gpmuk5f,"5% its $1.1 per share? Looks like you were right though if you sold yesterday since it dumped today. I figure it will rise though going into the dividend date so we will see what happens.

34,gpnlsjb,"I did get lucky by selling RKT yesterday (also you have till Friday if you want to get that 5% dividend, however I don't think anyone will care about that after today).

However I put some of those Tendies into UWMC (got in a little to high premarket), and pretty much was at a wash between Tues and wed, still up quite a bit from Monday.

I'm now all in again with GME, it's following the exact same pattern in Jan (if it breaks it today then the next date to look at is the 19th)... AMC is not following the exact same pattern, But in the ballpark. I want them to both go, but in the possibility one goes and the other doesn't, the other one will surely go down from panick selling day traders getting in on the rush. However it could work in our benefit if everyone goes back to AMC and we could experience another short squeeze after the other, giving us massive profits if done correctly.

Could be totally wrong, obviously my opinion and I want us all to succeed bigly... My folks suffered from 08' and they did they're best for me, I want to help them out.

Yea I hear you on that bro, but some dumbasses take it pretty personal when they lose their money because they put their money in a stock someone suggested on a public forum. It's your choice have to do your DD. I for one really need this money, and I really mean it I want the best for everyone. 

I'm not some greedy hedgefuck.

40,gpol4mj,"probable. Not highly, it depends on sentiment and people paying attention. Please remember GME is not all of the investors in the world, it is definitely becoming an indicator though. So just because GME-Gang are full blown ""GME ONLY WAY OUT"" doesn't mean that is the sentiment of the large number of investors and retail buyers.

It is sitting pretty. It may not launch, it may have a turbulent reevaluation, it may stay the same, it may tank. It is lining up to look at least better than what it was.

I just did a couple of options to learn options so I am not heavy in as I am still skeptical. But for the cost, what's it hurt? I am not expecting a huge burn like buying GME at 300, 90, 60.
