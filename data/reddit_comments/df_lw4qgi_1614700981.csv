10,gpfdb15,"Fairly high volume last half an hour or so and I am pretty sure it's not retail. IV rising as well. I think one of the hedge funds has been pushed out ( forced to cover) by another. Just speculating of course, but either way with these prices and volumes I'm pretty sure its just a battle between a bunch of different funds and their algos.

Let the best hedgefund/s win. And may at least some of us be backing the right ones, because I'm pretty sure long or short it's out of our hands at the moment!!",9,0,1614700986,sofarsogood84

[January 2021: DFV's portfolio was coming under frequent shorting. GME was starting to dip ... February: DFV orders the apes at WSB to buy GME stock, claiming it was undervalued. The stock mooned immediately, guess he really liked the stock. The hedgies tried one last time to bring him back to the fold. And if he sold, it all would have been forgotten. But he kept going, and he kept winning it his way, and they closed robin hood. They lost him. He was gone. Nothing but sporadic updates on WSB, showing the rest of the apes how to not fold. The hedgies knew his name by now, and they were scared of him. He and his apes were planning gamma squeezes all the way to 10k
