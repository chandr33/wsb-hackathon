Nope, check out the statistics.

Method 1 gets you 15% tax penalty on the tax withdrawals in 2022, Method 2 gets you 40% tax penalty in 2021 on the tax withdrawal assuming worst case top tax bracket. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll roll the dice on a pltr yolo with the hope it gets at least 35% return by end of year to make up for the tax penalty (25% for difference in long vs short term gains, plus an extra 10% assuming that‚Äôs what the boring fund gains over the same time period).

The lockup expiration tanked it 50% in just a few weeks, I really don‚Äôt see them having any problems growing 35% from here. But I dunno I‚Äôm just a gambling degenerate",1,0,1615349033,FarewellAndroid
