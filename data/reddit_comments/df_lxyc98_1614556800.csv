9,gppqrgr,"Yes, I think it's overvalued, but it is a growth story. When ZM was going up it was way f'n overvalued I even sold before it went to the moon before the covid crash.  
The tech behind it is real though and the customers are big ones betting their business on that tech. Customers move in slow like dinosaurs because it's the backoffice stuff migrating.",1,0,1614901830,AmenophisCat

IDK why he'd need a paycheck?! he's got billions just from the stock holdings, not counting the billions from his previous positions with ServiceNow and DataDomain IPOs.

14,gppszy5,"AWS/Azure/GCP will always win the cost battle. Unless SNOW is planning on getting in infrastructure game, margins will remain paper thin after paying off the big daddies for HW. 

The situation is worse for SNOW because each one of those vendors have real skin in the OLAP game with Redshift/Synapse/BigQuery. 

I am actually bullish on their tech. So yes, I expect to see definite growth in the near term but their operational expenses will remain ridiculously high. I expect they would be a prime acquisition target in 3-5 years after the growth eventually slows down.",4,0,1614902981,mastahkilla90

16,gppttfb,"This is a B2B service, not for small businesses.

The database is queried with SQL indeed, and that's a strength, and the output on screen like all databases will be boring rows of results. However that's not what matters for that part of the business: Everything's plumbed together with ETL stages, and queries that feed into other tools as needed. It's all about crunching TB or PB of data to make complicated correlations. The user interfaces are just there to prototype and run one-of queries, not run a business.

For data scientists the data would be fed into 3rd party, like python, R or GUI tools like Tableau to generate charts, via existing ""connectors"".

The things I consider is there's a vast amount of legacy data and processes in companies that are all databases and SQL scripts that need to be migrated. You can't move any of that without the compatibility.

I think that's why there's no direct comparison to PLTR which offers tools to build from scratch your analytics. Furthermore I don't believe a small business would be the target customer for Palantir either. If anything Palantir will pull data from Snowflake as one of its many inputs.

If anything  small businesses would buy integrated solutions. These solutions can be implemented on top of Snowflake. In fact companies are created on top of Snowflake's infrastructure now. Would you expect a small business to run Oracle. no. A fortune 500 company? yes.",2,0,1614903395,AmenophisCat

20,gppub35,"My fundamental issue with $SNOW is that their valuation is bonkers. The earnings were alarming as well - losses are growing proportionately with the revenue, suggesting that their structural problems have not been addressed yet. They can grow more, but if the market gets less frothy they may get a hard wake-up call. For now, I did a bearish bet on the earnings and got a good profit out of it (3/19 230p, bought at 4.5, sold at 11.5). In the ocean of red today, it prevented a margin call. Medium and long term, there is too much uncertainty to make it for me a stock to bet big on.",4,0,1614903641,Old_fart5070
