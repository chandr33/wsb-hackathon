9,gqg5nzu,"The bearish scenario for stocks is deflation. This means that despite the money printing and stimulus, we don't get inflation because the private sector credit collapses faster than the fed can print and faster than the government can spend.

Interest rates rising is bullish because that means that Jpow has to print more money to keep yields down. 

Market has it all backwards IMO. Falling interest rates and low inflation should be bad for stocks. No reason for Jpow to buy long term bonds if yields aren't going up.",1,0,1615386681,NorthernLeaf

54,gqg5spf,"Here is what I truly believe. 

Among all the potential short trades out there, betting on the crash of the $ and persistent significant inflation have to be the dumbest.

King dollar will remain king dollar and partly due to this we will continue to struggle to touch 2% inflation.

I think we agree that there is a bubble in everything, so to speak. However I think this bubble has just begun. 10x on spy and qqq from here is a very very strong possibility I see it.
