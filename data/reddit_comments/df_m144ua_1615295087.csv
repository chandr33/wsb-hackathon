Their assets and past acquisitions amount to about $300-400M in value. They have no debt and ~$70-100M cash in the bank. They will do approximately $400M in revenue this year with ~$40-50M profit. They are in an industry that is expected to grow 80% over the next three years, and they themselves are now enjoying 30% YoY growth. That is well worth a $600M market cap.

it could shoot up for dividend earning day. i don't know exactly when you have to hold until (just have it today at all or have to hold through until tomorrow). I just know you have to be on record as having it in your account today.
