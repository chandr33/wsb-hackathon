If it is above $35 at close this Friday all call options will expire in the money, which means institutions and whoever else wrote calls will have to buy shares to cover those calls. When a lot of people HAVE to buy shares, prices will go up. Also the company is buying back shares which is a good thing. (Also makes price go up)",3,0,1614711569,cman_14
