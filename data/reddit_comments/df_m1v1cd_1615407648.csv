I’m only in shares on soxl because I thought it’d rip post split allowing me to sell ccs well above my average cost and then it dumped hard and now I don’t have anymore $ available to average down further after catching to many falling knives. Now that CPI report, stimmy, and bond yields auctions are over with I’m hoping semis come back with a vengeance",3,0,1615407679,richtofin115

4,gqhmgwh,"Some guy got a temp ban for spam, so he made a sub, r/FuckWSBMods. The mods found out about it and they (plus some of us) started trolling it. Somebody made r/FuckFuckTheWSBMods, which everyone also started trolling. Fanny was trolling hardest, and dude got so mad he made that sub. But he also invited Fanny to be mod (so how mad could be have been?). She modded me then quit. Technically that Knoll guy is still *top* mod, but he's been permabanned from WSB so I doubt he'll be interested in doing anything with it. 

I'm just waiting until Fanny does something big, then I'll spam the sub all over everywhere and look like a fucking genius for having it ready and waiting. u/FannyPackPhantom had bettered do something big soon, though, as I'm liable to forget it exists given enough time.",3,0,1615407981,Flying_madman
