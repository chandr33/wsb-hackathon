18,gqcb0hr,"I lost my job after the crash, had a pregnant GF, we went homeless, my baby‚Äôs first night home was in a shelter. I had to join the military to get out of that, some shit happened (long story) and the courts took our baby away from us because I ‚Äúabandoned him by going to boot camp‚Äù and the boomers who took him had a 6 figure salary and clearly that would be better for the child than a humble life making a mid 30k income. Since then I‚Äôve been in a deep depression and have lived a highly unstable life. The big tech oligarchs have use social media to destroy interpersonal connections and life has just gotten terrible. 

But this, this feels good. This reminds me of the glory days of the internet, this reminds me of 4chan raids. It feels like all the  /b/tards turned in their ddos LOIC for stocks. I may only have two shares but the pool is fucking closed and I‚Äôm gonna hold",1,0,1615306161,blueunitzero

24,gqntnl9,"The mythical overrun hospitals never happened. During the worst of it we spent hundreds of millions on emergency field hospitals, most of which only treated a few dozen patients and some of which never treated even one patient. If hospitals were overrun then we would have had field hospitals that were actually used. If hospitals were overrun then we wouldn't have had so many laid off nurses and doctors.",1,0,1615527173,SohndesRheins
