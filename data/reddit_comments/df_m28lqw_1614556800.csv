4,gqhtytc,"Basically when the green and red get to the point of the triangle it will break out.  I think their will be lots banana's tomorrow. Someone planned it to where it was about to hit the tip right at closing.  They did it almost perfect, and last time GME was on the Short sale restriction GME had a gamma squeeze.  So I think there will be a decent size gamma squeeze that goes into Friday and over the weekend. 

Then the 15th a bunch of bonds mature ( idk what that means but I think more banana's)

then the 19th should be doom's day for the shorts.

Earnings reports comes out the 23rd which should add more fuel to the rocket.

If they tried to buy all those shares back they'd be buying the vast majority on the way back up.

You don't get to dump a million shares in an instant, drop the price, and buy a million back at the lower price in an instant. Each share is sold individually.
