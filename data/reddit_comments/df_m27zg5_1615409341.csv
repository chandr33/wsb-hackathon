5,gqhpp92,"My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that IBorrowDesk didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium
, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

220@$125.61 average

TLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding. Also, exact same tactic used on AMC, at the exact same time.",2065,6,1615409344,Trevonious
