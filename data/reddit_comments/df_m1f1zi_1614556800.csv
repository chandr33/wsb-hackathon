8,gqd9v3t,"Every time I look at an IPO they give the big boys a chance first, then they get to make a quick 20% on the FOMO, then it dips for a few days and eventually settles for about 70-80% of the offering.  I'm out until I see what it does unless I can buy-in first.",12,0,1615321158,chiefoogabooga

20,gqdi7a4,Right? Honestly I did this research specifically because I had to stop watching my GME. Call me MR. Bagholder gentleman.,1,0,1615324815,thegreatbeyond32

26,gqdk1qw,So my broker wont let me set a market order but will let me set a limit order rn HMm.... Do I set an order or just wait and see?,2,0,1615325626,Naustralia
27,gqdk5s2,"I want to buy this as my son and his asshole friends play it literally everyday. He somehow got my iTunes password and got $100 roblox dollars (FML). If I didn’t set a limit on it he could play it all day. In order to make my hundy back I’m gonna try and get in, I got most of my money in GME. But if the price is right, I’m gonna sell some other positions and buy in. Hopefully make some money on the DD of just watching my son spend hours day playing it.",2,0,1615325677,bgj556
28,gqdkwef,"I would wait and see, just read a Barron’s article stating that NYSE and the company are going to be working together to get to the list price. A reference DPO offering was listed at the last private sale price (Spotify’s DPO), but Roblox is not profitable so this stock may be overvalued at open.",2,0,1615326006,thegreatbeyond32
29,gqdl7t6,"That’s what a lot of people are banking on. This stock won’t be a big boy HF investment I don’t think, but mainly a predominantly retail driven one. But as another diamond hand, I respect your commitment to GME. This DD is brought to you by avoiding staring at my GME candles.",1,0,1615326149,thegreatbeyond32

34,gqdomu7,"Yeah I don’t think HF have kids that spend most of the day playing this (idk just an assumption). I can’t remember where I saw how much money they made but it was eye popping. But if this works out long term (not expecting anything like GME), I’ll be less annoyed about him playing.",1,0,1615327719,bgj556

36,gqdq62y,My primary concern is that this company is a fucking DMCA landmine. A non-trivial part of its success is that all the custom games built by kids are *filled* with copyright music that is just flying under the radar right now. Sooner or later the record labels are going to wise-up and are going to start demanding some revenue share.,1,0,1615328446,nezroy
37,gqdqq2c,Do you really care? It’s not like valuations make sense anymore,1,0,1615328710,HardtackOrange
38,gqdr11m,"If you put a limit order with a high enough price it will be filled at best price possible.

E.g. you set a limit order for $100 l, bu the actual price is $40, it will fill at $40. At least that’s what solid brokers do. I am sure Robinhood will fuck you over",1,0,1615328856,HardtackOrange

44,gqea6e2,Can you cite case law for this? Is there any way that since the games are not meant for monetization that it checks out as non issue since there is no money changing hands other than Roblox bucks?,2,0,1615338671,thegreatbeyond32
45,gqeam4n,"Revenue is 335 million since 12/2020, up 111% 
Operating income is -49.77 million
Cost of revenue is 277.05 million, up 121.9% since 12/2020",1,0,1615338907,thegreatbeyond32
46,gqecjyy,"Ignoring the fact that ""fair use"" is *far more restrictive* than simply ""we're not making money lol"", the fact is that ROBLOX *is* making money. A shit-ton of money. And every single game on their platform, free or otherwise, is part of the draw that brings in players who eventually spend money on ROBUX.

There's no scenario in the world where using copyright material without permission in these games is legal. They will be getting hammered with DMCA take-downs soon enough.",1,0,1615339944,nezroy
