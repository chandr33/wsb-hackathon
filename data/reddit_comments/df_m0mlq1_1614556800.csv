15,gq8og4k,I like that this story had hope a key factor but I feel awful for the guy who was in similarly depressed shoes and when stocks were the last hope they lost their savings on a yolo. For every turn around story here there‚Äôs another where someone‚Äôs run themselves into the ground. Glad to hear you have something to live for. Stocks are a fantastic distraction from the menial day to day. There‚Äôs always something new to learn,4,0,1615229393,AutoMaticTism

i told my colleagues about this play , some didn't even understand what the fuck i was talking about and the others shat their pants when they heard how much i bought.

31,gq8v63m,"I feel for ya as myself and others have gone through the same shit life brings us. I have lost family and friends in my 37 years here and have struggled to get by on my own because of my poor life decisions. I also almost died 4 years ago and woke from a coma after 7 days from a TBI. I am not fully disabled (or disabled at all according to the government because I am able to work and I don't want a $900 a month handout fromm SSDI, it's unlivable) so I get by doing food deliveries until I can find a job again. I got hired at Disneyland last years, worked there for a month until it closed. 

Anyways just reading your story has me reflect on my life too. I lost another recent job right before we got the $600 stimulus so I needed that money and didn't buy in on GME when my gut said ""do it!"" I bought in after that spike at around $60 and another around $80, sold off one last week for $100 (to cover rent) but holding my only share until the next stimulus payment. To the motherfucking moon we go! 

I love all you motherfucking apes! I hope one day when this over and we win big we can all buy an island together amd start our own country",4,0,1615232300,Oblongmind420

49,gq9b8fu,"I  can relate completely. I was in a pretty bad place back in January just before the first squeeze. But hearing about everything, reading everything, Wallstreetbets made me feel alive in the first time in a very long time. Even when it went temporarily tits up and I was looking at 82% losses I still felt... calm. 

I was better off than I was before. wsb energised me like nothing else had for years and even when the tendie ride stopped for a while, it was fine. 

Everything about this place is fucking awesome, and I fucking appreciate you retards. Now the second squeeze is on and hopefully I can piss on my former life from Valhalla.",4,0,1615239284,ExcitableSarcasm
