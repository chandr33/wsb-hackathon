2,gqlx6tj,"SNOW is a traditional IPO, most of the shares were locked up until a few days ago. Hence the price was way higher when it first IPO, and dropped significantly when the lockup expires. RBLX is a DPO. There is no lock-up period, so the price is not artificially high because of the low supply like a traditional IPO. RBLX will look more like PTLR (another company that does DPO instead of IPO)",2,0,1615491892,glamoutfit

5,gqme0zi,I got in yesterday at 66 changed my mind over night and exited at 74.80 easy little pay check. I figure the same. Itâ€™s way to high. At 45 it was promising..,1,0,1615499341,Western_Resort

8,gqmm7k3,"Coinbase will be good if it does DPO. That said, should not compare RBLX with SNOW. Great business + very positive sentiments. It will moon after all the insiders sold and only diamond hands left (so like in a couple weeks)",1,0,1615503219,glamoutfit
9,gqmmjxz,"Was looking to buy too but idk how this can grow to meet the valuation. Only option I see is to really commit to advertising. And even then, 36 million daily users isn't a ton compared to the companies really generating huge ad revenue",1,0,1615503388,BuckDitkus

12,gqo15oc,I am a 15 year old but I have noticed the trend of rblx dying in my country. Many kids nowadays play pubg and shit like that. I personally was a roblox player when I was 12-13 but it got boring when I started playing other heavy games such as rdr2. RBLX is connected to children and they are unpredictable. One day people might stop playing just because everyone might say roblox sucks on twitter or even here.,1,0,1615532969,zainwhb
13,gqogyvo,"I worked at Code Ninjas, a tutoring center for kids to code, for about a year. I can say confidently atleast 85% of the kids who came through the door played Roblox. Code Ninjas has summer camps, a club, and a whole unit dedicated to Roblox. It was insane lol.",1,0,1615548163,akiravakira

16,gqyjfx7,"It's overvalued and not profitable despite huge sales. I won't pretend to know the exact reason, but they pay their content creators like 70 cents of every dollar someone spends in their ""world/game"". Now that their so popular they could probably get into the positive if they lowered that to like 50%, but that would come at the cost of backlash. Feels like they put themselves between a rock and a hard place. They also pay their employees a fuckton, as well and their execs. Even their interns make like 65k a year lol and their average salaried position is around 150k. With around 2k employees I'm sure they spend north of 300 million on just payroll and paying out their execs and bonuses. Add that to the massive amount they're dishing out to their content creators and it's not hard to see how they're not profitable lol. With that said I've only looked into roblox very shortly and very far from a complete picture.",1,0,1615765226,redditingatwork23
