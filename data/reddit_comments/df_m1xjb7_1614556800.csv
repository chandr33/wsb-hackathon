I've been fascinated by monetization in games since Farmville. I play 4 regularly, 2 of which I have played for 8 years. 

The mechanic that gets me to spend money (and that's not easy) is a type of monthly subscription type where if I spend 5 bucks I get some cheats for the month and can advance faster.

I'm curious about how the game gets you to spend $.",1,0,1615385596,QueenMelle

52,gqg6kjy,Roblox operates like YouTube kind of. Creators can basically be anyone because you donâ€™t need to code to make something you just have to be able to make it work like using lego digital. Then you create a game in it that offers rewards but also things can be bought using in game currency. 70% of that in game currency goes back to the creator to buy prizes for the players or can be reconverted back to real money. This means there are a lot of games being made and are rated and played by online influencers that all these kids follow. Kids watch these gamers more than regular tv shows.,1,0,1615387122,jedidopedawg
53,gqg71vz,Except retail traders will drive this and so will investors. Retail traders know how much time their kids are spending time wise and money wise on this game. Kids are using it like zoom but playing a game on their phones.,1,0,1615387355,jedidopedawg

56,gqg7yhm,This has monetized money that the creator can receive a portion of what they sell in game and then convert to real dollars. The game has prizes like random prize boxes and stuff where players can win a rare prize or common and then the players can trade items. But what the game creator sells they get70% of the robux money and the company gets the other 30% of usd value. The game creator then uses that to buy more prizes and use whatever is left to get real money put into their account.,2,0,1615387774,jedidopedawg
