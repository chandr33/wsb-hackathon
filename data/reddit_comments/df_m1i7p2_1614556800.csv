8,gqdt4m0,"The problem lies in the type of sand we are using. Desert sand is largely useless to us. The overwhelming bulk of the sand we harvest goes to make concrete, and for that purpose, desert sand grains are the wrong shape. Eroded by wind rather than water, they are too smooth and rounded to lock together to form stable concrete. 
The sand we need is the more angular stuff found in the beds, banks, and floodplains of rivers, as well as in lakes and on the seashore. The demand for that material is so intense that around the world, riverbeds and beaches are being stripped bare, and farmlands and forests torn up to get at the precious grains. And in a growing number of countries, criminal gangs have moved in to the trade, spawning an often lethal black market in sand.

25,gqdv4or,"I am very down for this play - was thinking about it last week - but the problem is I can't find a company or fund or anything that directly implicates sand for construction. Like glass companies USE sand - and might stand to profit from a higher price product I guess - but might also lose value if sand prices go up.

Snd and us silica are mostly fracking sand for the oil industry - necessary and likely to go up in price - but the real problem is sand for concrete and construction, where you NEED that water eroded sand particle to make things work.
