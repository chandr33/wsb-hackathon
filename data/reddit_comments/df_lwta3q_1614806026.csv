With these profits I've bought shares of RKT, UWMC, and many others. You should obviously be trying to make money as you buy more shares, and you inevitably sell some of the shares you're buying in order to profit and multiply the number you can afford to hold.

Recently, I made money on SNDL and TLRY, but I still own TLRY. I look at it every once in a while, wondering if I should take the loss and throw the tiny amount of money at a different weed company. I have a small collection of weed stocks now, and I don't even smoke.

I don't even care about legalization as a social issue; I'm the opposite of a ""stock activist"". Regardless, I might miss my TLRY too much to ever sell. Now I want to see if it goes up just to resolve whether people who believed in it were right or not. It's a strange sort of sentimentality mixed with intellectual distraction that keeps me attached to some stocks, beyond reason.

Some of my stoks sit around gathering dust until I forget I own them, then I get notified some limit sell activated on a stock I was bagholding (but was I really tho) way back when it didn't moon. It's worth more to me sometimes to see resolution on the DD reasoning behind the purchase of certain stocks than it is to ""get to the moon"". I obviously want to get to the moon, but sometimes I wonder if it's just to be able to play this game at a different level -- not to enjoy a better quality of materialistic life.

96,gple6ey,"I think the possibility of a short squeeze still exists, but it's far less likely than it was in January. And I think they're not as easy to pull off as everyone thinks. In particular, I don't think retail investors have the power to do it. If you want to cite the January squeeze, that was hedge funds vs hedge funds. A price target on GME right now is virtually impossible with its volatility. I think it drops back down to the $40-$50 range, hedge funds will try to trigger small gamma squeezes now and then while it ping-pongs between there and $100-$150 until everyone here gets bored and quits. But since that's my thesis you're essentially asking me to tell you when I think people here are going to get bored and/or tired of bag holding for hedge funds. It already happened once (twice if you count the recent $180 high). It's not nearly as hyped as the first time. More people will drop off the wagon each time and sentiment will slowly shift to ""enough about GME already, that ship has sailed"".

Edit: And I think the only reason DFV is ""still in"" and even bought more shares is because he doesn't want the litigation, death threats, etc, etc that will come his way if he sells/sold at the peak, and he can afford it. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind. I really don't think even he is still in because he believes in the stock anymore. Dude has $15million, I doubt he could give a shit.
