also ceo and co-founder own 95% of the shares outstanding!!! wtf. they must have pulled them back from the borrow wherever they have them in custoday. morgan stanely?

I hear you

I was thinking the same thing about that. But I feel the squeeze has started with RKT and think it would be far more profitable to pull out earlier. Either it started yesterday or today, but it's important to note that every squeeze would last about three days (I could be extremely wrong on that, that's what I notice from all historical squeezes)...

And I see AMC coming up next and it should be bigger than the first squeeze by at least x2 amount. Followed by GME (forecasts state on the 19th) which should be the mother all squeezes. They are both following the 08' volkswagen squeeze pretty decently, and looking at the three month period we have a beautiful cup and handle for both of em'.

For me personally I'm transferring Tendies from one squeeze to the next giving me the largest leverage. 

This is my opinion, and my gut tells me it's going to be in that order. 

Also this is not financial advice, but if you find it helpful I'm glad. I want us all to succeed In this.

Get it

I'm not leaving that option off the table, depending on what the market does. Forecast constantly change, and I have adjust everyday. We've been having three bear market days in a row, and GME has been doing pretty damn good considering all things. We're due for a good day, that'll be good everyone (wouldn't be surprised if it's market manipulation from the hedgehogs attempting to bring GME down).

Considering we're doing good on bad days, I'm certain GME/ AMC/ RKT will do phenomenal when it's a bull run.
