10,gpggi55,"This is the wrong group to get any sound advice from, brother. Especially, given your age. Look into other Investing subs. 

Also, given the current frenzy associated with this group- I don't think anyone from the group should be giving any financial advice- for your sake and theirs lol.",1,0,1614717930,Brown_bagel_32
11,gpgglpj,"Not sure if shitpost or not - but you‚Äôre going to get better answers over on r/investing. All you‚Äôre going to get here is GME, AMC and PLTR calls. Personally if coke and prostitutes are available - invest in that.
