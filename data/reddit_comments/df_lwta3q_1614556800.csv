38,gpj3yxq,"It was very clear that the RKTers were attacking the GME Apes yesterday and then the GME Apes repaid in kind and it just got messy. It became us vs them rather than everyone rinsing both stocks out of as many tendies as possible. If I had to guess, I would say the Hedgies are chasing down opportunities to get them cash hard and fast to cover their already significant losses. They do not care about us, they care about money, they do not care if we make money as long as they make money. That I think is the most important part.

So yes, I completely agree there has been targeted attempts to cause division and lack of focus on GME while leveraging a chance for them to make bank on RKT along with the rest of you.

**Not everything is GME. Not everything is RKT. Not everything is whatever the next ticker mentioned in some DD is. Not everything is some HF scheme to attack some set of people.**

Imagine the idea that people can invest or make plays in more than one stock?

Imagine that people have others ideas, opinions, and potential insights and are willing to share those with you but if it isn't confirmation bias for your only adopted opinion, you want to violently reject it and call it some devious plot against you?

There are a lot of fucking companies and stocks on the market and a lot of opportunities to make money in the continuing bull market.

I think when you get millions of uniformed masses together in one place who just follow the herd mentality, you get severe confusion, panic, and doubt because these people don't seem to get the idea that regardless of what anyone says or does here, **you're on your own and make your own decisions of what to do with your money.**
