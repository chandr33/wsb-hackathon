Lose 50% of your life savings in stock market:  Depression and self-loathing.

Fed doubles the money supply in a month (reducing value of cash by 50%):  nobody notices.

YOLO's are about the roller coaster ride, and getting that nagging bitch to finally divorce you because you frivolously bet half your net worth away in one day trade.  (only to have it finally pay off after the divorce is final)

70,gpog5le,"Yeah. I treat this like if I were going to a casino. I only put down as much money as I would be willing to lose on a trip to Vegas. It‚Äôs certainly fun, but I bought more stock in Altria yesterday (than anything I put in GME or AMC) with the leftover cash from Morgan Stanley buying out my shares of Eaton Vance. 

I think AMC is a legitimate investment all things considered though. Their stock price before the pandemic was significantly higher than what it is now, and they should start to actually have revenue again by mid summer. 

For GME, you aren‚Äôt buying stock in that one for the company itself. You are trying to get a hold of someone‚Äôs lien against the stock that they shouldn‚Äôt have put against the stock in the first place. 

I believe the people here are fundamentally correct about GME and AMC but both stocks just aren‚Äôt what I normally invest in and I refuse to break my own investment rules beyond a small amount of fun. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

88,gpoiqhc,You‚Äôre trying to apply a quantitative analysis to something that is qualitative. The study most likely was done for insurance purposes and other companies to ‚Äúvalue a human life‚Äù The very notion is absurd and would more likely apply to the *monetary value* of the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù persons life. Assuming they used arithmetic mean this would be completely absurd and would have so many outliers it would pretty much leave their study labeled as useless. Sociologically speaking one can‚Äôt value a persons life as it is completely relative to the observers world view. Yes you ‚Äúcould lose 7M‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt take away from the individuals non-monetary value.
