So if you do not bother waiting a bit longer: we will provide a service which tracks data like overall sentiment, trending topics/themes, overall attention as well as traditional data for individual stocks (metions, posts, tweets, news etc.) . 

Our system will make it far easier for you to research aformentioned stocks, giving you more time for specific in-depth analysis. The service will cover steps: 1, 2, 3, 5 saving like half the work for you and there are several other ways to incorporate our data into any kind of strategy (e.g short-term trading strategies).
