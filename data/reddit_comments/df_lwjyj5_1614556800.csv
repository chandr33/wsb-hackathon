I would like to remind you that we also have a strict NO CAT policy. 

Please stick to eating crayons.",2,0,1614741963,Professional_Ice_410
3,gphty62,"Pretty doubtful tbh. Seems like a really low percentage.

I'm a CRSR fanboy too, but im not really relying on a short squeeze happening, just hoping for some natural organic growth because theyre a decent company.",9,0,1614742085,HardFlaccid
4,gphu0c8,i got some around the peak. thats just how i do babay,12,0,1614742117,MoonRocket42069
5,gphu4xw,Yeah your points valid. I just think its unfair because CRSR is a really solid company with great financials and longterm potential but its being unfairly best down after a great ER,1,0,1614742186,BigWilllly69420
6,gphuuni,"Entire market isnâ€™t making sense atm... great company yes, long stock yes, squeeze maybe but ... timing and volume need to be right",3,0,1614742575,VJ_KEVLAR
7,gphuuo5,why don't you fuck off - you didnt need to click it or keep reading,2,0,1614742575,Lifeception
8,gphv3u5,"yea but why are they saying short squeeze on things like RKT which was just 38% of float shorted - CRSR is 24% of float shorted, compared to GME these are both in the same league and look at RKT today.....

Not that I think RKT is a short squeeze, or CRSR - GME was maybe at one point....But by current WSB logic CRSR is a short squeeze candidate if RKT is.

edit: just trying to continue the conversation on WSB and whats getting called a ""short squeeze"" or that you are making some wild statements I disagree with",4,0,1614742713,Lifeception
9,gphvb24,"yup, they want to get in for more shares probably, start calling it a short squeeze and you'll get the attention of WSB",1,0,1614742822,Lifeception

17,gpiqyrs,It's a candidate for a short squeeze sure but at the moment there is no catalyst to start it. It's a good value play for the medium-long term presently.,2,0,1614767533,Sololoquor
18,gpirt2c,Ive been holding 420 shares for months waiting for the blowout runup. There was one to 49$ but i was greedy and felt it should be 60+. still holding in hopes,2,0,1614768359,thechosenguy1
