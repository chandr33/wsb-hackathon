$11.20 - 200 shares.

$10.52 - 300 shares.

$10.04 - 100 shares.

$9.86 - 100 shares.

$9.75 - 100 shares.

Then it just dove to below $9.50 and I sold everything at $9.45. 

Realized an $800 loss in about 3 hours. 

It didn't do anything that I thought it would. I was level headed for a while then I got emotional and fear came in. I bought RKT at the right time and sold far too soon (Made $100). Didn't want to make the same mistake twice. I completely doubted my position. *Sigh*

I learned a lot from this experience. I usually invest and don't trade but after watching RKT and seeing the similarities.... I jumped in. 

I usually sell at 2.5 percent down and look for 7.5 percent gains (or better with stop loss behind it).
