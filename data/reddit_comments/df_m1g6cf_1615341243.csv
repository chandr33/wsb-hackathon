33,gqef2ub,"Random memory.  Some of you may know I battled cancer a few years back.  I got a stem cell transplant and spent a month in a bed, by the time I was sent home I could barely walk due to atrophied muscles.  I slept as much as I possibly could during that time, barely ever got out of bed, and the furthest distance I had walked in almoat 30 days was 10 feet from my bed to my toilet.  I had to get wheeled from my room to the car in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk that far.  You get the idea.

My dogs had been on vacation at my dad's house and he came and dropped them off with me when I got home.  When all my visitors finally cleared out of my house, I decided to get some exercise.  It was one of the first nice spring days, but my chest and torso were covered in bandages and shit, so I put on gray sweat pants and a purple golf polo.  I took my dogs up and down the block, stumbling like an elderly person, and taking frequent breaks to catch my wind.  Looking the part with my bald head.

Some kids who had just gotten off a school bus saw me and started laughing and yelling at me.  ""Hey Dad, nice shirt!  Mom says you need to go mow the lawn!  Dad, help me with my homework.  Dad where are you going?  OKAY BYE DAD.""
