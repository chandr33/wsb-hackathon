1,gqjbejg,Agreed. Very misleading and it didnâ€™t fill till late in the day either. Super annoying so I am boycotting with you!,2,0,1615439434,BigRich1888

3,gqjbk2a,"Lol @ roblox losing money you have no understanding of free cash flow do you 

Imagine your sitting on a mountain of cash ðŸ’°but you can only grab it with a small shovel so people laugh at how little you can grab but your mountain gets bigger every day",4,0,1615439518,Gbear831

5,gqjbncb,"Roblox was a Direct listing, not an IPO, kind of like spotify.  As such there is no IPO offering to private investors before it hits the market, they literally sold existing shares directly on the market.  So while they estimated their price at $45, which is a mere formality, they could not help that when they were going to release it upon the market the bid price was in the $64-67 range.  It is beneficial for the company to raise money.",3,0,1615439567,manolodf

7,gqjbqmj,"Once the initial investors are done milking at 2x then you'll have your chance to buy in @60 or lower. 
Definitely shady how they did that though. There never was an entry point like that ""estimate""",2,0,1615439618,TheOmnisOne

13,gqjcauh,I think Portnoys Buzz ETF was the first. On that one I'd set an alarm as I sleep days. When I got up at like 9:30 AM that day it had already gone up a little and then dropped (finished uts premuer down 3%) so I just went back to bed.,2,0,1615439924,tagmaster0135

15,gqjcs6w,"I threw a bid at $55 for 40 shares, it didn't fill. I bought 1 at $68 to get the feel for it. Likely to average down, but not up at the moment. I definitely think this company can print money, but I'm not ready to go in deep after not getting in at where I wanted to.",2,0,1615440206,lxnch50

21,gqjfwfg,"Yes true, I don""t really trust Robinhood to get me in at the best price so the limit order was a last resort. I knew from what I've read it could open a lot higher but Robinhood was showing the $45 as if that would be the starting price when it came available. If I were trying to go long on something like this it would not be that big of a deal but this was something I was more interested in trying to day trade.",1,0,1615441936,tagmaster0135
