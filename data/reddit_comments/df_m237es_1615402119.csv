3,gqh8jun,"Halts are done to reduce volatility. These are circuit breakers that happen when a stock has a massive swing within a few minutes. These are automatic and prevent trading on emotion and adrenaline, and also to prevent trading algorithms from fucking destroying themselves. This is not market manipulation or something initiated by a hedge fund pressing a button. The same thing happens if there's a drastic swing upwards. As you probably saw, they may be a good thing that prevents a stock price from plummeting for no reason.

Also, according to the wiki page on Algorithmic Trading, 92% of trades on the foreign exchange currency market are done by computers. I dunno how much is done on the NYSE, but I'd bet on it being fuckin' substantial.

Basically, I wouldn't call market halts market manipulation. I'm not saying they're right, I just mean it's not someone on the phone saying ""oh shit stop the trades"". There's much better evidence of market manipulation. The halts aren't that evidence.

Also, halts happen quicker on the way up, and slower on the way down. If a stock drops from $1,000 to $900, then that's a 10% drop and it's halted. But if a stock goes from $50 to $60, that's a 20% increase, and the stock would be halted twice. If the halts are based on percentages, then it makes sense that it would be halted more going up than down. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it's how the market works, for all stocks.

You will doubtless have learned the details of the Great GME War before this reaches you. The losses of the 28th were dreadful. A mere fortnight prior one could not have imagined the tragedy that besieged us that day. Many a paper handed retard were smite from the field of battle, their voices silenced by the unrelenting march of the vindictive hedgies.

But on we marched, with our brothers in misery perched upon our sturdy shoulders. Despite our tiresome predicament, fortune smiles upon us as many a foreign retard and autist offered assistance in our endeavor. Twas much sought after since the hedgies sneakily thieved much of the ammunition in the early dawn. We shall persevere and hold our ground. Nary an inch will be submitted to our enemies as they musn't be allowed to posses this sacred field of tendies.
