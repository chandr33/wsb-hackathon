27,gqhth4w,"I'm dumb, but in my mind a conditional order (one triggers the other) that starts with a trailing stop order to sell that triggers a stop order to buy is where it's at.  

Get out when it starts plunging (after a $50 or so drop from the peak, to allow for plenty of fluctuations) and it immediately triggers an order to get in when the price moves up $5.  If the drop stops exactly where you set your first order, you'll be out $5 per share, but if it keeps dropping (like today) then it auto buys at the first upward bump, leaving you with the same number of shares and some bonus tendies for your troubles.

I'm sure I'll find a way for this to backfire spectacularly, but it seems to be working so far.",1,0,1615410979,Cromulent_Tom
