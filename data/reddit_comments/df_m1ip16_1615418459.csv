6,gqj37hn,"I really appreciate this post - while I‚Äôm on board for what would be unfathomable money to me at 100k per share I can‚Äôt help but think about how it seems like it would only take one major player to undermine this whole play for retail investors. I‚Äôm seeing the life changing money theoretically possible,  but also wary of being Charlie Brown with the football and watching big money leave us in the dust. I‚Äôve been trying to come to terms with a more realistic expectation and this post was a really great way to explore those scenarios. I hope these big institutions let the little guys have a win and don‚Äôt beat us to the door but I don‚Äôt know how confident I can feel that‚Äôs going to happen.

Love your other posts btw much appreciated üôè",1,0,1615434169,sidirhfbrh
7,gqj464q,"As my last post dug into, I cannot give any info on price targets confidently other than 100k. I'm quite certain 100k would have negligible impact on the market, satisfy most retail investors, crush the small hedges, and could easily be bailed out if need be. 500k and 1mil are deserved on paper, but I'm not clairvoyant. They might just not be targets that the big longs wanna fuck with, and nobody can pretend to know. We've gotta remain realistic.",3,0,1615434779,Broviet

15,gqrs2h3,"what's your exit strategy?  I'm curious as you don't believe it will go higher than some number you have in your mind.  i am expecting fuckery but if BRK.A can be 300k/sh then why can't GME?  hypothetically speaking, of course.",1,0,1615611609,readyg0

18,gqru99z,"given HF and SEC are fuckbuddies, it's likely that systemic risk could be concluded.  Especially when they're liquidating everything just to cover GME.  but what happens when they halt?  Do they force GME to dilute? i mean wtf about all the diamond dicks holding thinking it cant go tits up?  I'm ready to ride to tendieland but im having a hard time knowing how far it can go before the wheels fall off. know what i mean?  we heading into uncharted territory.",1,0,1615613219,readyg0
