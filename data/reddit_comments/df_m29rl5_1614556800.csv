10,gqi4bqc,"Saying ""Inverse"" CNBC is about the same as the folks on CNBC saying ""WSB is just a mish-mash of frat boy idiocy without any value for investing"", or whatever Ron Insana said a week or so ago. 

I keep CNBC on in the background most of the day.  I try to pay attention to the Fast Money crowd at noon and 5pm.  After watching the network for...way too long, I've learned personalities.  When certain ones zig when I expect them to zag, that's when their comments become investible.

Guy Adami is great for setting price targets to watch for on dips.

If uber-conservative Karen Finerman says she's taking a new position, especially if she says she just did a deep dive on the company's debt, you don't wait for a dip to follow her in. (Wish I had done this when she bough WW a couple of weeks ago at $25)

Josh Brown is great for names we like here.  Never buy when he's pounding the table, as the boomers spike it for a few minutes to a day.  But his theories are sound when ""he likes the stock"".

Dan Nathan finally got me in to AAPL after I kept missing entry points, nailed the bottom of the last major dip at $116 before it ran to 140.  He's often overly bearish so when he says to buy, I perk up.

Joe Terranova helps me expand the universe of stocks that have momentum coming that I wouldn't otherwise usually consider.

Steve Weiss can be frustrating, but he got me in (and out, and it, and out) of XPO.  I wish I had listened to Farmer Jim Lebanthal on GM 15 points before I did.

TL; DR:  None of us are paying them to advise us.  They provide info.  It's up to us to screen it and use it (or not) for our own purposes.  

But always inverse Cramer.",10,0,1615415873,One_Eyed_Man_King

13,gqi8w6b,"I’d be cautious assuming malice from media. It’s more often holding to preconceived notions and incompetence, than it is people participating in a conspiracy. People at CNBC talk to hedgies all day, so not surprising they have similar thinking. But I’m not sure they’re really personally invested in protecting the short sellers.",0,0,1615418115,EthanCoxMTL
