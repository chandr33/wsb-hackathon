3,gq6cdvb,"Take it for what you will, but my current belief is that day traders are going to take advantage of the initial offering. Meaning, a lot of people are going to buy at market open and I’m thinking by 10:30-1 PM EST there will be a sell off from people trying to ride the wave and cash out on their quick profits. There will be a price reduction we’re it’ll hit resistance and then climb back to the opening price/slightly above. Check out the daily charts for other companies that did direct listings and there is a trend of this more times than not. I’m personally going to sit out on the first day and get in on Thursday, but that could change depending on the metrics of Wednesday",1,0,1615176116,theironscrotum
