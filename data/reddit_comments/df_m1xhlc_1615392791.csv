10,gqgjpmu,I'm not sure if that is a good idea. GME is acting weird and it's hard to predict anything right now. But my strategy is to hold and buy more if it drops to a level where I can afford to buy some shares. -not financial advice,1,0,1615392795,RevolutionaryPost230

65,gqgjrn0,"100k*70M = 9T Market value. Stop thst Idiotic Bullshit. Thats how you make sure new investers and memebrs of this subreddit become bag holders. There is no way this goes over 10k. Id be really, really amazaed if it reaches 1k. RN its all pretty similar to last months peak. Which was at 400. There arent many significsnt changes, the situation is similar. 

Impact of RH limiting stock purchase was over-exaggerated, because RH can simply lend shares you own with them, meaning they arent inducing much pressure.
WSBs influence (apart from media attention) has jet to be proven. 

This is a „battle“ between Hedges that are long and Hesges that are short on GME, with public, support for the longs though Media and WSB. 
Maybe we do more than I give credit for here. But even if so, theres no guarantee we stick together. The „Dimnod hand crew“ was hyping this stock when it was short of hitting 150$ again, after last peak...
