The media would be straight on the spin, label GME investors as terrorists, alt right, whatever buzzword they use. Politicians will not care either, they don't want a massive stock market crash.

Lastly. Hedges are on both side of this trade. Short positions are fucked to say the least as this keeps rising, but they will have a plan and unless they are margin called (and I believe there will be a step in before that) they will just bite the interest for the time being, so the larger players will just be able to sit through it, smaller players get squeezed out.

On the other side of the trade, institutional investors will want to protect their other investments. They will pull their big investments at specific prices. They will end up with 100s of millions regardless and can just call of the risk for the sake of a massive gain. They don't want a bunch of hedge funds being forced to liquidate positions in other stocks and potentially bring the price of other investments down to big investors who are long.
