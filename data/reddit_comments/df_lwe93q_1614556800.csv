Wen't from 0 short shares available at close on Friday to over 600,000 at close today. If the volume stays low, the price will remain somewhat unchanged, and they will continue to cover.

And I don‚Äôt trust any of you fucks in here enough, to fully believe one or the either.

What I DO know is... these fuckers had a hell of earnings call, they hold 15% of a mortgage market- as well as somehow increased profits during a pandemic, they were shorted like 30-35%, I keep seeing more and more commercials for them daily, the dividends are given on the 23rd, to get those you have to be a shareholder still on the end of the 8th, and today is the fucking 2nd...

So... I mean, yeah, we can all just bail tomorrow and take our small tendies to GME... but what fucking reason would that make sense? Other than to stop this from gaining more traction...

Again, im just a newly minted smooth brained retard here... but I think I might be doing a lot more ACTUAL reading/researching then the average dumb fucks who keep shouting AMC/GME simply because they bought high and fucking paranoid that r/DeepFuckingValue is never going to let them fuck their wives and/or husbands ever again.

If you wanna bail on RKT, bail.
If you wanna hold, HODL.

But the sheer number of people that are commenting in EVERY RKT THREAD to fucking bail, and leave, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to get bad monday‚Äù.... seems pretty fucking excessive for a place that mostly tells each other how fucking retarded we all are.
