54,gqhauah,"not sure about buying - but it's more likely to climb than fall at this point imo. About 1/5 of the shares available to short as there were before the big dump (which took them weeks/months to accumulate), SSR in effect tomorrow, earnings report for Q4 end of month, stimulus package passed (overall market indicators are good for a while), monthly calls expiring next Friday. As long as we can survive until Friday and finish above $300 (which is looking likely), we can climb a fair bit more.
