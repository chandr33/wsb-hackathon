3,gqhob5h,"Assuming the price of the stock doesn’t change there’s always a small loss at first because of the price difference between bid and ask. 

If fidelity is showing that you bought at $12 then it’s because you bought at $12. Perhaps you bought a couple shares higher then averaged down w your $10 buy? Or you placed a market buy and the price changed between when you placed it (and logged it in your tracking app) and when it went through. 

Go to your account activity and check your history (can also just click on the stock in the fidelity web browser) to see your activity history for that stock. (Clicking the stock will only show your current buy positions, not anything you’ve sold. Your history will show your buys and sells and the prices and totals. You can sort your history by ticker. Use the website for this. Fidelity app sucks boomer balls.)

Ps. Fuck off.",1,0,1615408753,InevitableRhubarb232
