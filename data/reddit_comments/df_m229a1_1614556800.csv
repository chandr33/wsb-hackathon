6,gqgtou8,"I...sold at 147 to cut my losses, intraday traded back up to 300 and then just recently sold everything to buy more GME. I regret not holding and this experience has taught me a lot about trading stocks and the mentality required to do so. I am sorry for having been a fair weather ape and a paper handed bitch. 

I said this right before GME tanked and I sold fast enough to keep profits and buy back in once it starts soaring again.",5,0,1615396727,Darth_Cartsalot

13,gqvwnc7,"Yeah, I noticed that, After I sold GME again I decided to stop trading and following reddit for a bit. I made back my initial investment so it was time to step back and reevaluate.

Thank you for the advice. Definitely needed.",1,0,1615714748,Darth_Cartsalot
14,gqw1w8z,"Np in the long run you will be fine but it‚Äôs important to be real to yourself about FOMO. While gme is fun and I‚Äôm holding 5 shares @147 each, it‚Äôs pure gambling. The time to go all in was at 45, then 120, and now 250? You see what I‚Äôm getting at lmfao. There‚Äôs a stock that goes up 40-50% in a single trading day every week. Plenty of opportunities to come",1,0,1615720342,lokisk1155
