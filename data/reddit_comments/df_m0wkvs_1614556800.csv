1,gqa9983,"I'd be happy to do a ""here's the spam queue"" stream or something. I think the claims of boundless bountiful bounced content are overstated. We do catch some good DD here and there but we usually manually approve it within an hour.",15,0,1615256939,zjz

4,gqaag2t,"Mods get a bad wrap. Yall do good work. Some of my own shit has been pulled but some gets through. Luck of the draw and ranging quality. My GME $1k meme post made it to hot but some DD Didn‚Äôt... granted now I know it was bc of content guidelines and not posting positions during the clusterfuck run-up. 

Thnx mods! üöÄüöÄ",4,0,1615257592,Will_I_Mmm
5,gqabkkp,"I get it (this was a cheap meme) &amp; respect you zjz.

My criticism is I didn't see anything here but GME Porn when I was posting this ‚Äì which is partially why I posted it.

It'd be nice to see some intellectual diversity. When you see something counter-intuitive, it can trigger a 2nd look.",4,0,1615258215,YouDantKnowMe

8,gqabu8r,I'd move only if u/zjz moved. He's here &amp; will take care of it. I made my point. Meme diversity is important.,2,0,1615258366,YouDantKnowMe
9,gqabw1m,How'd 2020 work out for you? This meme bought my wife's boyfriend a new letterman jacket last March.,3,0,1615258395,YouDantKnowMe
10,gqacgmq,"Pretty well great, then got both tlry and most of gme done perfectly so far. 

And as always gz, just saying you could have pushed through some dd instead.",1,0,1615258706,JinnPhD
11,gqacl1f,"I have the same issue with all the half assed gme dd. You‚Äôll know the good stuff when you see it. I appreciated actually seeing rkt and a few others show up, but I mostly hang in New now",4,0,1615258776,JinnPhD

13,gqadx68,"The funny thing is, even being a newcomer here, I can see it's gonna get even worse. Think about it. After GME goes nuclear and people get their payout, they'll be loaded with a lot of capital looking for the next play. And there is already a whole line up of heavily shorted tickers people are clamoring to bring attention to. Whether it's the theater chain, the sporting goods store, or the mortgage company, this place is almost certainly headed to a round two of monopolized focus.",3,0,1615259519,xaekai
14,gqae3za,"Yeah, I totally could've done some DD. It probably would've gotten through. I should do some DD on why now is cool to buy. JP is just gaining altitude right now. We should have one more medium bounce left in the Covid bull market.",1,0,1615259623,YouDantKnowMe
15,gqaeqgo,"Nah, it gets echo-chambery whenever there's a new flock. I was new last Feb. Everyone was complaining just the same.

It got awesome like 2 months after the new flock. I think people lose some money chasing waterfalls then get serious.",3,0,1615259968,YouDantKnowMe
16,gqaidc3,GME gang got quiet af when it first dropped to $50.,1,0,1615262036,ZeroTolerrance
17,gqap6s2,I don't think that people who say we prey on shorts understand that trying to short squeeze stocks in general is a bad play. Stocks are usually shorted for a reason and don't ever get shorted over 100%. GME is unique.,1,0,1615266313,Merovingian_M
18,gqaptwz,"Because a bunch of fucking social mediatards heard about the GME squeeze and were all ‚ÄúiM gOnNa bE rIcH‚Äù and suddenly joined the market and the page associated with it. These same idiots started posting thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna make me rich‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt sell at the top. They don‚Äôt know how this all works. Now you see a bunch of them ‚ÄúI lost it all because I put my life savings in at $300/share‚Äù

WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN, THIS ISNT FUCKING VEGAS",1,0,1615266757,Brendonk23
19,gqaqpwp,"Of course. But hedgies love fucking *each other*, and if retail traders pile onto something they can exploit that to take some large bites out their competitors.
