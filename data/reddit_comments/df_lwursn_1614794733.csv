52,gpk6odr,"He got autobanned by a bot for an entirely unrelated thread. 

He received a detailed explanation was in a PM that automatically gets sent out. But I guess instead of PMing modmail asking for an unban, he decided to spread lies instead.

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7g09/rkt_shorts_r_fuk

Was removed automatically for being way too short. Here's the ""valuable discussion"" you're missing out on:

&gt;$RKT Shorts re-entering? Didn‚Äôt they learn their lesson with $GME - there‚Äôs no waiting it out, after this week we won‚Äôt  see the 20s again. Now they are going to lose more money as it goes up while and pay 80% interest on borrowed shares. Have fun paying out those naked puts.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe we should call them Dumb Money.

So. Yeah.

Discussion threads have a decently high bar to pass, otherwise we'd be getting flooded with low effort stuff like this. OP knew this, and has been warned in the past.

People lie about why they get banned *all the time*. Just think, why would we ban someone for a good faith effort in posting DD?

Edit: 

Now that I'm looking at his most recent DD thread, it's not even that good. Just more short fear mongering...

Edit 2:

LOL. Looks like he's had it out for us for a while:

68,gpk6ynk,"I'm on here every day at all times and literally saw it start when I exited my position on GME on the 28th.  Yes people like revisiting stocks, but still...It shot up past 40 and is now down 29-30% right around where it opened yesterday.  I personally find it suspect, but good on anyone that jumped in and was able to make a profit so far.  

I have the same thoughts on people that keep posting, ""don't forget about me at 350""  or (insert price) is not a meme.  Other than the movies, no one goes into a casino to make sure everyone there wins.  That don't forget about me at 350 person will sell if Gamestop hits 340.

I went 240 to 8k on the 22nd on 3 47 calls exp EOD, and then 6k on the 26th to 46k morning of 28th for GME on 3 115 calls exp EOW.  Even then on the second play, I stayed past my price target and got lucky.  Immediately transferred everything out of RH shortly after and moved it over to fidelity and that funny money stuff we don't mention here.  

Get your money, get your gains, get your tendies, but realize that there is no us.  We may all be on here posting together, but there is no us.  Every other person here has their best interests in mind and they will hose you up fast.
