1,gqfm59b,"There has been a bit of DD lately and their IPO is today so ofc there's some talk about it.

Iirc ""the play"" is to let the IPO happen, wait a bit for the prices to settle and hold it longterm. So rather a r/investing strategy than some retarded YOLO.

3,gqfm5co,"Yeah but you're not getting the dividend on that anyways, right? I guess you're right that it's way better if the stock moons during the vesting period. I'm sure the Amazon employees who got stock awards pre-2020 don't have a problem with their golden handcuffs.

At least you get publicly traded shares. I have RSUs in a private company and I can't do shit with them unless there's a 'liquidity event.' If that happens I get to decide to cash out, or diamond hand until the next 'liquidity event'- whenever the fuck that might be. Maybe I should ask the CEO to get in touch with Ackman; he's still looking for a target for his SPAC, right?",1,0,1615373630,UsingYourWifi

This is what I do, not possible to shuffle money around with the small amount I have in my portfolio, so I can probably look into etoro on the side or something.
