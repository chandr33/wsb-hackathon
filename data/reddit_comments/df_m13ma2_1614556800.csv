15,gqbbj0z,"NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE  you see where it goes down a bit after rising, then rises again?  that's the dip, buy the dip.  if the stock continues to dip after you buy it, buy more because you buy the dip.  Once you are out of savings, take out a personal loan for the max amount you can, then have your family take out loans as well, mortgage everything, sell your shit, and buy more.  No matter how low it drops, just buy more, because that's just the dip, and you always buy the dip.  Don't buy all at once, don't want to miss out on that sweet dip discount, so just buy in blocks of about 1000 at a time, you'll be on the moon sooner than you can think",1,0,1615286119,bigsoftee84

GME is purely a binary bet.

Either it will hit 1000 USD if indeed the short squeeze materializes or it will drop back to $5 if nothing happens.
