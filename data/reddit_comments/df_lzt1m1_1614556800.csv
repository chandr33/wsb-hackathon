7,gq3st7a,"Dude, sorry to be the one to brake this to you but we're not organized and we have no common agenda. Some are here for money, some just like the stock and some, like yourself, have more political reasons. Fuck, some are even shorting the stock. And that's ok. Because we all do our own research.

15,gq3t7gy,"I mean, there's a lot more to change here than just this one system. Literally everything we encounter outside of the environment we create for ourselves at home is designed to pry every last penny we make away from us for someone else's mechanism, and make is think it's our idea and that we are happier for doing it.
