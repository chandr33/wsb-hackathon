65,gpj6m08,"I've been looking in to this. I'm new to stocks, already lost a few k from being a moron but have since learned a lot. I doubt GME will go to 800$ but the risk is worth it. I don't have the funds to buy 100 GME @ 120 and all the rules and regulations are still murky(PDT, GFV, etc). But it's so cheap and the upside is so tremendous it's worth the bet... but I just have to figure out how to actually make money on it if it were to happen because I doubt it would stay ITM long enough for me to figure out what the hell I need to do to get that $$$ without the cash on hand to by 12k and then sell quick enough. I'm still not 100% sure this is not a huge pump and dump to scam retailers ;/ Either way the HF's are doing an amazing job with their propaganda. If the Bull thesis is actually true, and it seems that way from my limited knowledge(which might have just left me holding the bag) then too the moon! I don't see how the hell it can come back down. GME is then in a positive feedback loop and the only way the HF's(or retail if it is a scam) can not be decimated is to cut their loses of billions and get the h ell out of dodge(or have the tax payers bail them out again).

If only I entered in a few months sooner I'd be sitting pretty and have most of this shit worked out, I got in on the tail end of the last squeeze not having a clue about the markets or what was actually going on make a quick 100$ in a few minutes then lost 2k over the next month because of psychological manipulation/weakness.",1,0,1614779193,EternalDissonance
