There's no reason for China to lie about supporting $NIO, especially since $NIO is in fact a Chinese company and the main Chinese EV company competing with $TSLA.

Money can be acquired through taxing the pants off of big corps that reside in China... but in order to get big tax $, need to tax big corps.

You fail to explain why this is a good buy, IMO.  Comparing their market cap to GM just makes me feel GM is undervalued... or worse.  Also, the 44 miles an hour is *just* for home charging with wall connector.  Super chargers can charge much faster for road trips, etc.  There are other issues with your DD, but those jumped out first.

I do think it rebounds short term, but let's be real.  NIO is heavily correlated with TSLA and NIO's valuation has more to do with $TSLA success (and NIO just not shitting the bed) than anything, IMO.",2,1,1615265623,gameover2020

74,gqcdxnf,"i watched, The China Hustle last night and it made me really weary of these companies how they can pretty much fake their financials before being listed on the NYSE, just to raise capital toward a pump and dump.

anyone actually see pictures of the factory?

in the documentary there was a paper company valued at $100M+ but it was all bs in actuality they had like 40 employees and 1 delivery driver, but all the financials were faked.

not saying NIO isnt legit but, when a company can fake it all, reverse merger a existing us stock listing and then pretty much all be on paper its worrying.
