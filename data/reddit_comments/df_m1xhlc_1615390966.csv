18,gqgf5zx,"no, but you have a great idea for a new book series for sure :D
I'm buying a few shares of AGFY for long term, since I think they can and will do much more than weed growing, and their developments will translate into space-agriculture too. IPOd not long ago, so I am betting they are still way undervalued relative to a year or two from now. also looking at AUUD because they are cheap and seem kinda interesting. This roblox thing got me thinking of IPOs again, and it is too pricy and hot for me to play with much, but these others are down in my realm. Another coming some time is a non-meat printing company called MeaTech3D(MITC I think), but they have not made any actual earnings yet and so might be in bad shape as a stock for a while...might be good eventually though, Idk.
Not saying to move on them, but I think at least one is worth having on your radar :)",2,0,1615390972,Knary_Feathers
