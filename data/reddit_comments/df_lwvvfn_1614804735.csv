46,gpl1oc8,"**Why are DD on OCGN getting deleted?**

This has a market cap more than 1B so meets the subs min requirement

Its the highest traded share today on yahoo finance

Its moving on news that the vaccine they are marketing has better phase 3 results than JNJ and AZN and also handles mutant strains better than the mrna vaccines as it is an old style whole virus vaccine.

Plus options trading just started up on it so heavy buying of otm options can cause a gamma squeeze. Its also being heavily targetted by shorts

So it is the quintessential WSB stock. But any post with OCGN DD is getting removed

49,gpl2ci0,"So, I read this through and was initially skeptical. Malls were dying off before COVID. The entirety of their business is managing Specialty malls.

There is no value added play that I am aware of, other than a high Short %. It looks like a fully justified short position. 

And then I looked up where they are located and remembered how packed the ""Factory Outlet"" malls are. Then I start thinking about the fact that so many people put on COVID weight, have nothing but sweat pants or yoga pants to wear. And remember, the ratio of teens and tweens to Adult shoppers is high. They outgrow shit fast and will be in School again.

So, While I'm not getting the excitement of a rocket blast off vibe from this, I will add it to my list of further research.

Thanks for the heads up.",32,0,1614809123,G_yebba
