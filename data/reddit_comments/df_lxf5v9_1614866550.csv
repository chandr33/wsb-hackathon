Story went like this. 

Guy gets to the Yukon for the gold rush. Buys all his gear outfits a raft to make it down the river and stake a claim.

Raft overturns and he loses all his supplies. Makes it out with the clothes on his back and his pack.


Buys more gear outfits another raft and again loses it all in the rapids.


Makes it to shore and promptly shoots himself. 

This was a stupid decision the professor says. A permanent solution to a temporary problem is always a stupid decision.

82,gpnmo9x,"Also, this is money. Depending on which country you live in, most will have bankruptcy laws. They exist to HELP YOU.

Declaring Bankruptcy is a great tool to stick it to the man. I am convinced that the stigma around bankruptcy is pushed by big players so that you will pour blood sweat and tears into their pockets for your whole life trying to dig yourself out of a money pit.

Fuck that. Declare bankruptcy. boom. All sorted. In the UK, no more chasing, no more letters, no more red bills. They will take your shit, but not all your shit. They have to leave you basics like a roof over your head (they might put a charge on your property equity), they even have to leave you your car if its cheap enough!

Live frugally for 6 years and pay back what you can. The courts calculate this, they calculate how much you need to live reasonably, then share the rest. then boom. You have passed go, collect your metaphorical ¬£200 and start afresh. Anything you did not pay back is written off. 

Yes there may be some restrictions in the types of jobs you'll be able to have but that's it. 

GOLDEN RULE (UK): if it's going to take longer than 6 years to pay off and you don't care about restrictions on job, then declare bankruptcy.

This is why you hear of rich people declaring bankruptcy - they know its a tool. Use it. Don't fucking kill yourself",3,0,1614868485,easypeeler5

94,gpnniep,"Listen you fuckin apes. I tried to kill myself when I was 19. I put serious effort into it, and I gotta tell you, after all the shit I've been through, surviving *myself* is probably the hardest thing I've ever done.

I'm 34 now. Here's some shit I would have missed had I been successful 15 years ago:

\-The births of both of my daughters

\-Their first giggles, first steps, first words, the first time they told me they love me

\-A million seconds of gut busting laughter

\-The look on my father's face when he was bouncing my daughter in the air above his head and she threw up in his mouth

\-Every single Dark Souls game

\-Yearly cabin trips with my friends

\-Seeing Paris, Germany, half of the United States, and yes, even Kuwait and Afghanistan

\-my story. I could tell it and it might bore some people but it's mine and no one can take that shit from me.

And I'll tell you what. This comment might sound hopeful, but *I'm still struggling.* Some days are better than others. Some days I barely survive myself.

But you can be broke without being poor. And even when you're struggling, you're never totally alone. I know how hard it can be to ask for help, or to even *want* to ask for help. I know what it's like for that dark cloud to be always following you, Eeyore.

But this is your. fucking. story. Don't let giving up be your final salvo. Take the trip, play the games, enjoy the laughs, accept the tears, absorb the losses, and take the profits.
