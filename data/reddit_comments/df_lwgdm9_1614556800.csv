1,gph8kob,It's getting moderated because it is below $1B in market cap,2,0,1614731094,somethingcleverlater
2,gph91hx,It's not about buying stock it's a warning about Mariner and how they should be banned.  This company anyways will be a very big player in EV btw.,5,0,1614731334,Canadianpainter59
3,gph9j11,I'm not arguing with you. I'm just pointing out that any post or comment that mentions a ticker that has less than $1B in market cap is deleted.,1,0,1614731583,somethingcleverlater
4,gphb016,These guys planned this bought shares for weeks and today they released a falsified report and shit on the company and their shareholders for their own gain.  They are not even good at it.  The SEC must come down hard on them.,4,0,1614732337,Canadianpainter59
5,gphbke5,I get it. No argument just pissed off that a company can do this.   I would just like people to know about Mariner and to do research.  I looked at them and knew it was wrong so I bought shares.    Thank you,2,0,1614732630,Canadianpainter59
6,gphe2m2,"Looks like Mariner did something similar to GP in September 2020 and the stock rallied right after the dip. Are these guys just liars?

14,gphphw5,Iâ€™ve answered it I other posts.  Pics are wrong info is wrong  the palencia test and a happening in July in LA.  The have a huge contract with SEA one the biggest ev companies in the world. Almost every thing was half truths or lies. Look up  Mariner and the other companies they did this to. All successful viable. Their return margin is -41%.  Yeah and the only truth is that they have a post office box for mail. Ridicules,7,0,1614739840,Canadianpainter59

23,gpirmwn,"Waste your money on this stock if you want.

The idea that companies like Tesla, Porsche/VW, Lucid and others making EV's don't try to regulate the electricity flowing through the motors to make them efficient is beyond ludicrous. This company claims they can save a few m/s switching from serial to parallel configurations. I guess, when putting this stuff out to people who have no idea what this actually means and then saying you tested your system and it provides some amazing benefit (compared to what did you test it?) is easy to sell. I doubt, any EV automaker will even talk to you.

I have no idea who Mariner Research is or what their motivation is, but that anyone would invest in this company without doing some major DD is pathetic. Basically, seems this company is promoting some abstract tech stuff that seems good enough to get people excited but is lacking otherwise.",-7,0,1614768194,aka0007

28,gpj9kdm,"For people who are not familiar, EXRO is a real, genuine, company with a great product that just started landing sales.

They got targeted by some phantom short seller group with a sketchy web site and enough money to pay seeking alpha to publish an easily disputed and manipulative short report on the company, and then they forced a panic sell. This is not a high volume stock and it doesn't take a lot of capital to manipulate the price and cause a panic.

Just like GME, these guys are trying to ruin a great company for their own gain.  We could use some fellow retards to send these fucks packing and make a buck in the process.  This is a GOOD company folks.",6,0,1614780766,arazok
29,gpj9tn0,Look it up look at Mariner see the other companies they did this to.  Green power blink audio eye  read    Youâ€™ll see they published false reports on many companies and shorted them also.  Now they are all viable. The office in Vancouver the picture in their report go on Google earth you will see the correct building. Why no mention of SEA electric one of the biggest players in the EV industry. They have a big partnership with them why was this left out of report.  Almost everything in that report is false or misleading.  Just go through each point and investigate you will see.  The only truth is they have a P.O. Box for mail.  The patents these guys hold will be in every ev vehicle in the future as it gets rid of the gear box,1,0,1614780898,Canadianpainter59

Now you are just trolling.

Their website lists two bikes. the District First Edition and Founder Edition.

They are making 20 Founder Editions and 60 First Editions.

Congrats on finding a possible buyer for 80 of these motor controllers.

Let's see the Founder's Edition Bike costs $15K so x 20 = $300K and the First Edition costs $8K so x 60 = $480K. So total revenue of $780K on the bikes. I assume this somehow should magically support a several hundred million dollar market cap for a supplier of one little part.

Seriously, either you are the CEO of the company talking garbage trying to boost the value of your company up, or you are a literal idiot and hope others will also be idiots.",1,0,1614783852,aka0007
