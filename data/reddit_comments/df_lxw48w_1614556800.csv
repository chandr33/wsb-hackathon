It's a good move IMO as well as the rest of the companies you listed. I'm waiting on UMC to blast off and have been buying every time it dips more. What Im looking at is when Biden decides to try to ramp up semiconductor production in the USA to compete against China, who is going to get government grants and huge tax breaks? TXN? MU? AVGO?
