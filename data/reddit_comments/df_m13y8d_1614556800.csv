Yes, a private company controls the private bank (they're the bank that big banks like Goldman, BofA, etc. use themselves) that the federal government uses. Also, DTCC holds all of our securities as collatoral for money loaned to the US gov. They have the US by the balls and can technically, though likely not do unless in war time, liquidate securities to make good on gov loans.
