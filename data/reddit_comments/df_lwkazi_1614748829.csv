37,gpibf13,I understand where you coming from. But you need to cool off a bit. It's a free sub that's about making dem tendies. And everyone wants tendies. You don't need to worry about gme. It'll happen. Nobody knows when but it'll happen for sure. If dfv is still ofc we all going to be in too. But making some money is important too. That way we can get more gme. Sorry for blowing off on you but I just couldn't take it anymore seeing posts about shills and ppl calling good dd shills and whatnot.

I didn't bother to look at your history and know nothing about you but from how you talk about GME it feels like you're forgetting the scrutiny WSB is under right now.

63,gpj6tz1,"That’s not what’s happening. The hedgies who lost money are making it right back on this round. They’re the ones driving the price up, causing gamma squeezes by exercising options, selling their exercised options right back to the market makers, and shorting at the top. 

They were caught with their pants down in January. This time they’re the primary driver of the squeezes, and the ones making the most profits. Retail will take the fall for it, and they can get away with causing repeated gamma squeezes.

This whole “SI is x% of free float” is silly. Who gives a shit? The hedge funds sure don’t. Because they’re all shorted at 200+ from the positions they took out during the last squeeze. What happened in January was unprecedented. What’s happening now is the hedge funds learned from that and are taking advantage of the exact same mechanism in an extremely calculated way.

Suppose you have a million shares shorted at 100. You’re under water on them, and if you try and buy them out, it’ll cause the price to jump, causing you to lose even more money. Seems pretty shitty. 

So what you do, is buy 2 million deep ITM call options. You exercise them, and effectively take your position from net short to net long. And the market makers are the ones who have to scramble and buy up those shares when you exercise them. Then, on the next cycle when they’re scrambling for shares, you happen to have 1 million shares they can buy. 

The hedge funds are driving prices right now, not wsb or retail, and they’re doing shady market manipulation shit that retail will take the fall for. And how will they blame retail? By copying and pasting posts like this that make it seem like a pump and dump.",2,0,1614779312,bongoissomewhatnifty
