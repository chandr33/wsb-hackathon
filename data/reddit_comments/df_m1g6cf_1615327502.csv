13,gqdo7qh,"I'm actually slightly concerned that GME's potential to reach the moon might be limited by its status as a meme stock. How many reddit users will want to farm karma by selling at $420.69? Will industry whales sell at $420.68 knowing that fake diamond hands will sell at $420.69?  

I'm sure as hell not selling then, but I would like the thumb screws to turn harder on HFs. I just hope that GME doesn't lose momentum there because it's a meme.
