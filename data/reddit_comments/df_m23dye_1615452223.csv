1,gqjw81n,"First time I ever bought any single stock in my life was GME...5 stocks, 3 at 50 and 2 at 100... I forgot to check my portfolio since then, seems it's up 319%. WTF? :) Should I dump it and just buy silver for my piddly 5 shares of GME or keep holding?",1,0,1615452574,Martin5791

7,gqjzrsm,"Look, suppose the same thing happens again, we reach almost 500, then they fuck us down to 50 in two days. So fucking what? Then we won't sell, buy more, and do the same thing again. We've come to bargain, and we're gonna do it over and over again until we win.

So long as you don't sell, you didn't lose anything. You just own an asset that currently is worth less, but is literally multiplying tenfold and going down again multiple times in a very short time",1,0,1615455262,LTMG

10,gqkd5na,Canadian apes what app do you use? Iâ€™m using WSI and it holds your deposits for 3 days. And two days in a row my stock buy wouldnâ€™t happen. I assumed it was volatility stopping it.,1,0,1615465063,Idonediditdonedidit
