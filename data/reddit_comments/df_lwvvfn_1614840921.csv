5,gpmq7u0,"Yeah, whatever mr shill. These stupid distractions fall day by day, and they are obvious as fuck. RKT yesterday and the other mortgage company bullshit spouted at the same time. Same sad old shite for weeks, didnt stop at all you fool. Its just too obvious now. And the clock is ticking hard, hence the roll out of scuzy shills each day.

But keep thinking your clever enough to fool people all the time. Its stupidity at its finest.

AMC had solid DD behind it, well shorted. Now it also has decent chances in the future as well, thanks to the way they reacted. Same way you look like a shit shill by your actions.

You are way worth ignoring.
