15,gqgirad,I was scared GME was going to go red today and here’s why. I chocked the 🐓 before I went to bed last night and God always seems to punish me when I do. When I was still playing cod the day after I whacked I would always suck ass or I would find a way to injury myself or spill something. Now that GME is up up I am keeping my head on a swivel for falling/flying objects lol.,17,0,1615392434,Mitch_Grizz
