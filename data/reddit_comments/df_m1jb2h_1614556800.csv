Subscriptions would be up due to Covid.

It's still super popular with youtubers (thank my daughter and others for watching this shit day in day out). This is one key element of their advertising. Almost every popular youtuber has an account and have something going on with Roblox. Seeing as it's a simple game everyone can join in too. 

The platform allows the kids to build near on whatever they want so if they get bored they do something else inside the game. It also means it's scaleable for different age groups or to cater for different interests. 

Im bullish but feel there may be a dump of internal shares initially. Also explained in more detail in another post by someone else.

The real question is how long can they sustain this even if they get back into the black and start making actual profits? The pandemic is the single largest driving force behind their extreme growth.

70,gqeqgpy,"I’m thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I’m doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let’s try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated.  But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I’m a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf
More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let’s low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ )
minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.  

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees.  Some are in China, some make more than others.  Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let’s estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year.  That’s another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million *estimated* left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs.  Back to Dan Williams.  His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers.  AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive.  My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020.  This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location     providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic).  Roblox wouldn’t have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site.  At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year.  Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.

The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part.  Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS.  Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth.  I also don’t know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.

I’m gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs.  $586.13 million minus that *very* rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills. 

I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn’t even be going public.  Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume.  Look at Steam...


So, long term:

Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming).  They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.


I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue.  I didn’t fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I’m not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I’ve got tomorrow am.  I’m a high risk, short term profit guy - so that’s I’m betting on.  But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening.  After looking deeper into the rockstars on the Roblox team, and typing all this shit up on mobile - I like the upside.",1,0,1615347573,benco420
