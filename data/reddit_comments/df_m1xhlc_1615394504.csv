24,gqgo57h,Options expire on March 19th. All we need to do is litterally hold past that date. 4 x the amount of options will be expiring this time. Which means anyone why bought puts will be forced to buy calls the hedge their loss on the put options that will be expiring on the 19th. Then this shit will be going way higher than it did last time. At least 4 x higher. So about 1200 a share we should see on GME. Check the options chain for MArch 19th. Thank me after. Just do yourself a favor and get in while you still can,26,0,1615394506,Buntafujiwara85
