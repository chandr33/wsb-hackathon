35,gpnn6aw,"For those that are new at this:

* Instead of sweating the dips, buy them.

* $118-$125 swings are very common and no reason to get alarmed (or overly excited for that matter) 

* Anything under $118 should be seen as an enticing buying opportunity. 

* Buy single shares through the dips to slow momentum down 

* There are no ‚Äúdates‚Äù that the squeeze will happen, have patience, and enjoy the ride!",655,2,1614868726,Mauser-Nut91
