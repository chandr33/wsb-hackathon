0,gqg0c8z,"This post is blatantly false.

EPS is negative. That's not profits. I'd like to know where OP is getting that PE ratio from.

SI is 12% of the float. Not a great short squeeze target. 12m shares short out of over a billion total shares.

Have fun lighting your money on fire.",1,0,1615383914,imperator285
1,gqg3tx1,"Yeah I see that actually, but thank you (and other commenters) for pointing out this BS. I fomo'd into it last week without doing my own DD or even rigorously reading other people's (and confusing bots and shills for humans). Luckily I only bought one of each, so not too sad about the loss. Probably shouldn't have contributed to the ridiculousness with my comment.",1,0,1615385769,Althonse
2,gqgakyy,I looked into this. The key part is if u enter the index at the **LOWER**  end it is saying there isnt much change. UWMC is entering somewhere in the middle I believe. I.E that holds no relevance to it..,1,0,1615388979,ReLisK

9,gqmugfq,"Yah... “the shorts” aren’t making anything squeeze here with UWMC. Not every stock is GameStop. In fact, none are GameStop. UWMC is an unsexy company in and unsexy sector, and is not undervalued.",1,0,1615507456,GringoExpress
10,gqn15lo,"You been doing research on a stock you don’t like? You know the float, the institutional ownership, and which funds are shorting it? This has nothing to do with GameStop bro, I do actual research and then set a buy in price, and then set an exit price. You go ahead and do you.

Nobody has a mortgage or uses mortgage companies",1,0,1615510986,Live-Ad6746
11,gqnwo5p,"That’s fair. Your point about this stimulus making mortgage stocks pop a little is probably right, but there are no “shorts making it squeeze”. This concept is so loosely thrown around since GME when in fact it’s not nearly as common as people think.

Besides, UWMC just had its run-up to ~$13.80 on the coattails of RKT before plummeting to almost half its value. It’s probably a safe buy at this point but there is no imminent squeeze happening and to suggest otherwise is misleading.",1,0,1615529374,GringoExpress
