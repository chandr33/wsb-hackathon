23,gpnmy0r,"So when a option writer sells a call they are promising to deliver shares at whatever the strike price is if the buyer chooses to exercise. So the option buyer pays the call seller the premium, plus whatever the strike price is for 100 shares per contract. When this happens no new shares are purchased from the float, shares are only traded hands for an agreed upon price, if anything it would lower the price because people only exercise calls that are below the market price. It would affect the price of the option seller didn‚Äôt have those shares anymore if they sold them when they opened the contract, then they would have to buy at the market price 100 shares per contract they sold naked

Ladder attacks are something someone started saying to theorize that hedge funds buy and sell to each other to lower the price but it‚Äôs not a real thing.
