1,gpl6kxv,"RKT is the move. RKT is a great swing trade to get extra tendies to throw at $GME üçóüçóüçó. I took profits yesterday when it was up %70 and bought the dip today.  RKT has a good correction this morning which should have been expected, and it has formed a new support around $28. Still an undervalued stock and theres no way shorts have covered. Dividends are locked in on the 6th I think.",10,0,1614811083,shaneedlin99
