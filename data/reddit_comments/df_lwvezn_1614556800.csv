2,gpjl2my,"Just to counter your points on brine mining you should probably be aware of Vulcan Energy. It's another ASX listed firm. Quoted from their site:

""we aim to produce the worldâ€™s first, premium, battery-quality **Zero Carbon LithiumÂ®** hydroxide, by harnessing renewable geothermal energy to drive lithium production, without using evaporation, mining or fossil fuels.

We will do this from our combined deep geothermal and lithium brine resource, which is Europeâ€™s largest lithium resource, in the Upper Rhine Valley of Germany.

Our resource is large enough to satisfy Europeâ€™s lithium needs for many years to come, and ensure the transition to electric vehicles is done with minimal environmental footprint. Europe is the worldâ€™s fastest growing lithium chemicals market, with zero local supply.""",4,0,1614786131,wasupg

6,gpjy2hk,"Every company is saying that they can supply whomevers lithium need, and every EV maker is saying they can be self sufficient in sourcing their lithium. The general vibe in getting is itâ€™s standard company fluff thatâ€™s put out to attract investors. Most analysts Iâ€™m reading are saying that there is no way that supply will outpace demand over the next five years. Iâ€™ll have to look into this company but given the low price of lithium the last few years there hasnâ€™t been incentive to ramp up infrastructure. Lots of places are starting development but I think the key is who will be ready by the time the supply crunch comes/agreements between EV makers and lithium suppliers are struck.",1,0,1614791714,VeniceKing719
7,gpjy7yk,Iâ€™ve heard a lot about graphite but Iâ€™m hesitant to go all in on any company peddling new battery tech that uses different inputs. Short term I think lithium is still the play for the next few years but new innovation will come at some piunt,1,0,1614791780,VeniceKing719
8,gpjygi9,Iâ€™m honestly just desperate for discussion. I felt like I stumbled upon a golden goose but no analysts or retail traders are talking about it.,1,0,1614791882,VeniceKing719

10,gpk3alj,"Lithium mining is very obscured,I tried to do a dive on some of the big corps investing in Poland and I couldn't find one publicly traded corp...

The closest I got was LG Chem Ltd... If someone could find the companies involved in that project, it's going to explode very soon.",2,0,1614793941,donotgogenlty
11,gpk3ubn,"Thatâ€™s the big battery manufacturer. Itâ€™s looking like LG is splitting that off into its own division. Iâ€™m big on investing in all corners of this industry, miners, battery makers, new tech startups. EV makers I might not go in as heavy on since I think the supply producers will make their money regardless of the EV revolution actually happens or not. Ie Ford can make their EVs but no guarantee people will buy it.",1,0,1614794174,VeniceKing719

16,gpk5t99,"Do you know if LG changed the name? The stock looks dead when I try to look it up.

I agree about EV makers, but I know this battery mining project and production facility will produce about 11% of the global total. Considering it will have shorter lead time, higher standards, etc it seems like a great thing to invest into imo.",2,0,1614795020,donotgogenlty

20,gpkb07e,"I will look as well and let you know if I actually find anything, ""LG Chem Ltd"" is the current name listed, but I see ""LG Chem Group"" as well (although ""LG Chem Wroclaw Energy"" us a fully-owned Poland-based subsidiary or LG Chem)... Can't seem to find a way to invest ($LGCLF shows no activity since 2016?)

This is a *massive* western battery gigafactory project being bankrolled by the European Investment Bank and Bank for Reconstruction and Development, especially for Europe. It's projected to become the world's largest battery plant with 1-2 years (with on-site Lithium mining).


LG itself invested well over $1 Bill Euro and Poland in particular subsidizes business ventures so it's guaranteed not to fail, they've invested hundred of millions of dollars so far to compensate for negative market conditions (similar to Polish state-run LOT airlines).",2,0,1614797253,donotgogenlty
