Yeah yeah, do your own DD, but at least I was pointed in the right direction and it didn‚Äôt cost me a fee, or a commission and gives me a slice of pie that someone in a much nicer house would be eating.

Any advantage that can be passed on to the next person just trying to get ahead or find their place in the world is good enough for me.

My MO is you need to be able to take care of yourself to take care of others.  Aggressively pursue YOUR best life, in an honest an ethical way, not fucking over others but trying to give them a leg up on your journey.  If everybody was doing their best, to be their best while helping the people the meet on the way... what a wonderful world this could be.

Thank you for the kind words and the internet points; I wish you nothing but success.",4,1,1614841715,iamlickzy
