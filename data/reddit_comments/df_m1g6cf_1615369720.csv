For many, it's a strong buy due to the promising and powerful turnaround. The biggest transformation of the company it has ever known. The shift to digital ecommerce, while still leveraging and making great use of brick and mortar locations and assets. Using them as fulfilment centers to support not just same-day shipping, but rather, and this is practically unheard of even in 2021 - same-**hour** shipping. I could go on and on but you get the gist of it.
