10,gqb6e37,"Don’t bank on your 3 shares getting you filthy rich and out of the hole you’re in.  Use whatever profit you get to invest in your education in order to invest in your future.  Keep going for PA or dental hygienist school.  Keep reading up and learning as much as you can on investing.  Education shouldn’t stop just because you’re an adult. I’ve been investing for 11 years now. Started with stocks and options. Made a lot and lost a lot. Moved to over to mutual funds and made a lot doing nothing. Branched out into real estate and increased income. The past year I started reading A LOT during free time at work learning terms, strategies etc. Got back into stocks and options with a little help from WSB and made a shit ton. Making more money now trading then I do as a pharmacist and landlord.  

I’d recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad. The book discusses multiple streams of income and how to avoid getting that income eaten up by the government. 

TLDR:  we’re all fucking retarded, education is paramount, don’t listen to retards on WSB including me",1,0,1615281033,kytran40

I got absolutely annihilated in the comments recently for simply suggesting that having morals and not investing in things that are harmful to the planet is a good thing.

Also, I don't entirely agree with your sentiment that unemployed people are taking home more money than you is necessarily bad. Unemployed people are the ones that need the money the most so they don't end up on the street. Living paycheck to paycheck sucks, but losing your house sucks much worse. The problem is not that they're getting too much, but that you're not getting enough. Everyone with a net wealth of under $X should be getting a check.",1,0,1615282351,Ehralur

28,gqb9e2y,"Look man, the sooner you realize that no one is going to save you but yourself the better off you will be.

I started off working as a phlebotomist for the same shit pay you probably make as an EMT but just slowly slugged and slogged my way through college majoring in Clinical Lab Science and eventually after many years earned a bachelors degree.

I was making like 50-60K a year in midwest but was just basically a middle class schlub. I found out California pays double for doing the same job so packed up all my shit in a UHAUL and left everyone I knew and all my family to come here and make double and finally hit six figures.

I am now rapidly on my path to becoming a cash millionaire.

The bottom line is you need to come up with some kind of a plan to increase your income dramatically, Why not start by getting an Associates degree in RN where you can triple your income? It is basically the same skill set you use an EMT....Then eventually get you BSN or perhaps even your masters in nursing and become an NP. Slowly acquire more and more education and skills and boost your income.

Then simply live on less then you make and invest the delta into stocks, and watch yourself become wealthy.

The government will not rescue you, but you can create a plan to save yourself.",1,0,1615284049,MedicalLabScientist

31,gqb9jxo,"I have a few friends who are EMTs back in my home state and at some point talking them I realized that EMTs are the closest thing we have in the real world to superheroes.  They put themselves at risk every day going into unknown situations and literally save lives. 

It's a ridiculously high stress job where you take responsibility for another human life and every L adds onto the pile of shit you carry forever, for a survival wage, sacrificing health and sanity because you're doing something that may have started as a noble pursuit and ends up exposing you to the worst parts of being human.  Dealing with the catastrophically injured, unstable, and dead; teens inches away from death after OD'ing on god knows what - having to deal with blood, feces, vomit, infectious illnesses, and all manner of dangerous situations while maintaining a total professional demeanor, where time is a critical resource, and then going out and doing it again and again and again day after day.  Dealing with victims, the elderly, the mentally ill, terrified, suffering, confused, who absolutely depend on your presence of mind, your technical expertise, and your focus in the most stressful situations imaginable, while you're running on fumes in the last hours of a nightmare twelve hour or longer shift.  They do this job for between 20k and 50k a year on average, working an average of 50-70 hours a week.",1,0,1615284211,SaveRana

33,gqb9kic,"Honestly as long as enough people went along with it it would work. There's a lot of precedent showing it's an effective strategy. But the companies are counting on you caring more about saving lives than making enough to live on. And honestly if paramedics did go on strike, the companies would probably jump on the opportunity to blame the people striking for any deaths that happened and call them greedy. 

The only other option requires starting or taking over the administration side and replacing the managers with people who care about the business more than the money.

At this time I’m homeless trying to get back to ZERO.  I wish they had taught investing in College.  I have 2 degrees which means little in today’s competitive environment.

They SHOULD have been providing us with monthly stimulus checks similar to other developed nations like Canada. The fact that the stimulus check was not recurring, and that every republican (both House and Senate) voted against this most recent COVID relief bill should be very telling.

59,gqbcg8o,"Some thoughts:

a) Every failure is a possibility to learn from and improve. No causal effect, but at least a higher chance than doing nothing.

b) It's one thing to blame the parents/school/society/etc. for their failures. Does it change anything? Not from my experience. Does a GME gamble change anything? Maybe. Best from my experience is a mixture of accepting the situation and changing the situation.

c) Nowadays there are tons of possibilites to improve one's skillset even for free. I still recommend ""basic literature"", which is a minor investment compared to the possible outcome.

d) Get politically involved, if you need to. I consider unions part of political involvement. Might be better than a ""wsb movement"".

e) There are professionals to overcome/improve coping skills regarding psychological phenomena. (And being/feeling depressed in a sick world can first of all considered a healthy reaction.)",1,0,1615286997,Versuchender

There was an emt that comes to my hospital a lot who got beat pretty badly on the job and incurred a pretty severe TBI. He basically received no support from his company AMR. Even more baffling enough he came back to the job and continues to make his Starbucks barista level salary.
