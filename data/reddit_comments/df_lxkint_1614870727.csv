26,gpnrjzn," August 29, 3333 AM (After Moon). The apes of Kepler-452b gather 'round the shrine of DFV in the plaza square for the yearly commemoration of his awesome DD. They chatter and screech excitedly, recounting the tale that has been passed down for ages of the Great Squozening of 2021 PM (Pre-Moon) that launched the monke generations into orbit. The statue of his likeness is solid gold except for the red cloth hachimaki, the diamond hands which hold some of his actual shares of GME, and the gigantic pair of titanium alloy balls. His foot rests upon the back of a faceless man in a suit, a symbol of the many dastardly hedge funds who fell in the war. An engraved plaque sits at the bottom of the statue next to a bushel of juicy tendies. The plaque reads: ""I am not a cat. I like the stock.""",12,0,1614870746,chatterthang

I, for one, know that as long as the volume stays low, it doesn't matter how high or low the price goes because that's how we know the squeeze is still coming. If the price shoots down and triggers the SSR, then I'm just gonna keep holding like I always do, but think twice before downvoting those comments. It's the assholes shouting ""sell!"" that we should be weary of.
