27,gqbmpae,"Looking at the media, they have decided to seem like they are long on GME and are using Cohen's appointment as the catalyst behind the rise. All that is done to hide, cover and hush hush the new SEC ruling about clearing. That is where the beast lays:

Everybody who is serious about the stock knows that there are more shares being traded daily than the actual shares, about 4 times as much, yes, that much. This is a huge problem, it is so big that no media outlet dares to touch that actual story. The 21-day rollover rule has created imaginary shares that have been 'failed to deliver' by shorts for months, maybe more. 

Options being written on shares that writers are told they own but in reality do not because they haven't been delivered by shorts to the clearing house is a fat big problem that threatens the whole financial system. This is much bigger than we think. What happens then is that brokers get caught in the middle. When the clearing house can not provide the actual stocks to brokers who have paid for them and told their customers they own the stock, we have serious fraud on the table.

There is going to be a responsible party for those imaginary shares. It will certainly not be retail holders, brokers will start buying the shorts into the stock to save themselves from being the responsible party. The SEC and the clearing house is no way going to be left holding the bag, that is too much responsibility and it would collapse the entire market.

Thus, the 2-day ruling. It is an incredibly important piece of news that everybody is trying to hide from the people and attention.  What is happening here is historic. As the price of GME goes up, the magnitude of the problem gets massive as the amount of money that cannot be accounted for gets huge.

I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. $1000 is not a meme, $2000 is around the corner, $5000 is no joke at all. Hold. You are witnessing one of the greatest stories of capitalism. This is getting serious.",1,0,1615294881,buylowstacks
