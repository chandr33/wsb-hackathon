43,gpnn1df,"Thanks for bringing more clarity to this huge group. I appreciate all the work this mod team has done. I think it's pretty crappy for so many people to be frothing at the mouth and constantly accusing this team of being corrupt, sellouts, shills, etc.
This mod and u/zjz have both proven themselves time and again. 

I hope there is some way we can figure out how to take over the costs of running the r/wsb mod stuff. I don't know what those costs are bc they haven't been disclosed, but I think it's unfair that the mods have to do all this work AND pay to do it too. I know mods can't profit, but it shouldn't cost anything either.",2,0,1614868661,Emgimeer
