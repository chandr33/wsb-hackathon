16,gqlhw5c,"SEC Rule 201 says that short sales must provide liquidity; they can't take liquidity.  It says nothing about the tick direction.

The rule is not prevented to prevent people from short selling, it's intended to give current holders who wish to sell priority over short sellers. They accomplish this by preventing short sellers from taking liquidity.  A holder of the stock can make a marketable order and get fill immediately, which takes liquidity.  A short seller can't make a marketable order; they must provide liquidity with an offer above the current best bid.

This has absolutely nothing to do with tick direction; non-marketable orders (which provide liquidity) can be filled regardless of tick direction.

For example if the last trade was $100.01 and the current NBBO is 99.99 x 100.01, the short seller can ask $100.  If filled, this would be a downtick but it's ok because they are providing liquidity.  They CANNOT ask 99.99 because that would take liquidity.",1,0,1615485299,Keith_13
