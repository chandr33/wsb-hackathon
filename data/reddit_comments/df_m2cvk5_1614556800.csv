2,gqieygs,"""as well as whales potentially buying shares and dumping them setting off a chain reaction and stop loss raid""

Kind of.

The initial impulse was definitely institutional and not retail. I'd honestly bet most of the sell off was institutional and just a few unlucky suckers who set stop loss up.",3,0,1615421252,HardFlaccid

8,gqifak4,"You’re right also, it’s likely a combo. It’s nothing crazy we haven’t seen before. It’s some whales taking moderate profits, some hedgies reshorting hard, stop losses, cowards, etc etc. I do however think either a few contrarian hedgies or some clever whales have been secretly buying shares on the way up and then dumped them today, likely to buy more at the bottom so they can get a better price for the real squeeze (which they will also take early profits on).",0,0,1615421432,poopstar21

15,gqiftn4,Lmao idk why these paper hands sold. I bought 2 more and brought my average up. If you’re not willing to lose what you put into the market than don’t put it in at all. Never put money you can’t afford to lose.,3,0,1615421714,App2918q

17,gqifzna,"Yes it did. I personally know people who got out today. They couldn’t hang. That’s just the reality of the situation, stop losses were triggered.

29,gqihdl8,You can afford to do that. I’m saying if someone can’t afford to lose it. Like if it’s like life/death money. Having that money is better than risking it to go to 0 in one day. So I don’t recommend putting it into the market. The market is highly risk. It’s basically gambling at a casino. Bet everything on red turns black. If that was all your money then you lost it all and you can only blame yourself. Yea there’s a chance it could double but in a life/death situation that’s too high of a risk in my point of view. We’re all different so. I do get where you’re coming from too.,1,0,1615422532,App2918q
30,gqihfx0,"I wouldn’t be surprised if Bullish institutions sold hard to drop the price, then bought back in and used profits to buy options, looked like a lot of action in the option market after the plunge, especially for 3/12.... with any luck we have hedgies on our side now who knows if they are the short sellers trying to cover or just funds who want to get in on the action. I read a figure that $180M went into options for this Friday after the drop. If so even if they bought near the ITM line, that’s a lot of shares that will have to change hands this weekend. also it could of been done to keep short sellers from doing there thing, which was all they had to hold off the squeeze..... 

Real glad I bought the dip, just wish I had more funds.",2,0,1615422567,SBCATMWSC
31,gqihjn6,"Yea man same. Although I’ve definitely been beat up and turned out for being a diamond handed ape.

32,gqihozj,"NSorry I sounded like a dickhead. 

But any who lots of shorts in so they squeeze them out. Having retail hodling helps but without “THEM” this wouldn’t have happened.

Best of luck with it but always remember who ends up holding the bag.

THEM is whales, big money. Once they exit it’s done. Not saying it won’t go higher from here but be careful, move down much quicker than move up",1,0,1615422703,dkk1300
33,gqihpqj,"Yea no worries man, i agree with you. If it’s life and death that’s a dif story. However I think this opportunity presents a much higher than 2x payoff for a more limited downside currently. But I wouldn’t recommend anyone who can’t afford to Hodl to do this.

39,gqihyyc,I feel you man. I agree and wish I had more funds to buy the dip.

If you think retail has 0 impact on the market, our sentiment and our capital, then you are absolutely bonkers. I obviously know the whales move the market, and then secondarily there are retailers who nowadays have carved out a small chunk of things, we follow their broad strokes, yes, that’s why when they made the price drop, a lot of the retailers got out, creating a supplemental dip to the original dip.
