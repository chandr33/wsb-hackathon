That might also explain why it didn't rise back to the previous high for the day. Day traders got scared off, by the huge dip. To me, the relatively low volume this week, reinforces the idea.

87,gqi6omw,"FYI for anyone wanting to take a look (I am just too tired now…)

I tried to archive the article that was posted as stated at “12:43PM” ET via archive.org around 1pm-ish, IIRC, after I saw it referencing that trading had been halted until 12:50pm (as it referenced a time AFTER the time of article publication and I found that very odd) - but I can’t seem to pull up the non-updated version of the article from archive.org. Not sure if the link changed, something else, or if I’m just tired, but look at archive.org to see if you can dig anything up. 

Maybe it was coordinated, maybe it wasn’t. 

Either way, they SURE seem quick to print loss articles but super delayed to print gain ones on the stock - I think that says it all for me.
