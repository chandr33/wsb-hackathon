2,gqfq5iq,"I’m so pissed at myself for only buying 6 shares, I won’t be a millionaire like so many of y’all. I was so dead set on PLTR that I didn’t want to sell any of it to acquire more GME. 

It’s okay though, long term PLTR still seems like a good buy, and I’m perfectly content to sit on 100 of those shares. For now, fingers crossed for GME 1k, I really want a new car lol",1,0,1615377139,MachineLearning2001

5,gqfs4kg,"A lot of your assumptions are actually conservative. Gamestop, when they pivot, have the potential to drastically ramp up revenue. We don't know which markets they will set out to move into, or in what capacity. We can only assume their current model plus some extra. And that's a naïve outlook, a required outlook, but a projection that leaves most of what a younger, more in tune, line of officers can achieve. Gaming is big business, especially when you think that going to the theatre costs about as much as a premium game if it's a date night. 2 hours of catching covid and eating shitty popcorn, or 60-300 hours of entertainment. Their market is only getting bigger as more and more kids use Twitch as their primary source of entertainment. I'm sorta into this stock for years, maybe if there's some big run-up, I'd look into ways to expand my position, but I don't see a good reason to sell until there's clear news on the future direction of this company. And that might lose a large chunk of gains, but I struggle to see a future where bright, young, ambitious and aggressive investors can't make waves in the current gaming market.",1,0,1615378660,GroundhogExpert

16,gqfxzvv,"Chewy has a gross profit margin of about 24-25%, consistently. GameStop has a gross profit margin of about 27-28%, consistently.

Chewy has a net profit margin of -2 to -8%. GameStop has a net profit margin on -5 to -10%. GameStop hasn't earned a profit since 2018Q2, and Chewy has never had a profitable quarter.

GameStop has already started to, and is continuing to close down all non-profitable physical locations. They're also closing down locations that are in close proximity to other stores.

The revenue figures I used were also their worst since 2007. Two years ago they were doing almost $9B in revenue annually, which would equate to a $27-45B valuation range if they can return to those levels as an e-commerce retailer. The recent console cycle alone, which has not been reflected on any financials yet, will get them closer.",1,0,1615382575,AJDillonsMiddleLeg

23,gqfzjwi,"Also bear in mind that at peak, there'll be a major sell off. That will drop the price from the top to probably ~60-100. This will trigger a second round of buy offs, aka a dead cat bounce driving the price back up to 6-800 values (if the peak reaches several thousand a share), and that'll lead to a second fall off until the price stabilises to , 230-385 range.

I fully expect there to be two major money making opportunities with GME. The primary will for most lead to a 10-100-1000-10000x ROI, and the secondary will for most lead to a 3/5-30/50-300/500x ROI.

This is just napkin math and there's no real formula to the peak of a dead cat bounce, but dcbs and bull traps according to google are the same thing. DCBs also tend to occur the most during a short squeeze. We saw that happen with GME where it went to 347, dipped hard to 193 and then went back to 345 before declining down to ~40.

DCBs can happen multiple times per stock cycle as well. The higher the value the more bounces are possible. So if GME goes to Mars at 3,000/share theoretically, then it's entirely possible that a correction down to 1k could lead to a bounce back to 2k, then another correction down to 500 will bounce back to 1k, and then finally stabilize with ups and downs between 230-385.


Understand that the above is just an example. It's not real, and no one knows how high GME will go. More importantly, 85 cannot be stressed enough that DCBs though have the potential to make a bit more money along the way down, are very risky plays because there's no formula to how high those bounce peaks are. You could theoretically reinvest half your GME earnings expecting a significant gain only for it to within hours net you 10% before cratering 30% leading you to lose more than you gained.

Understand your own risk tolerance and trade responsibly.

---

All that said though, when GME gets to the top (whatever that is), if the 230-385 range is actually true for a fair value price, then puts against GME will be money making opportunities; though... the premiums on puts for GME out to anywhere from end of this month to Oct 15 are insane. ~110-115/share premium is insane. A single 420 put out to 10/15 is $28.8k.

Remember that puts can be used to acquire GME shares for a lower cost. The only risk is that you lose the premium when you exercise; which at 28.8k is ridiculous even if the potential profit value of that curve is multiple times that.

26,gqg0526,"I keep seeing people gloss over this.  This is a huge issue for GameStop transitioning.  

Another thing you missed is that video game publishers/makers are starting their own platforms (UPlay, EA Access, MS Games Pass, PS Now) and offering ""passes"" that provide access to all of their games for a monthly subscription.  The current climate is very hostile to outside retailers and it seems that the 1st parties are doing everything possible to cut them out entirely.  

I'm here for the ride but don't really see a bright future unless they somehow invent a new method of distributing games or hardware.  Maybe it benefits them if Epic vs Apple goes Epic's way and somehow translates to GameStop being allowed to sell on consoles.",1,0,1615383806,sublime81
