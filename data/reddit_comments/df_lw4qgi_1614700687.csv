Those are the ones u wanna be around anyway. Nearly 20.months old and my son loves brushing his teeth. Makes me proud. He's gonna have nice ones. Mine got initially ruined by running my mouth and the guy broke. The tops. Repairs from 6th grade broke down by. High-school. Waited well. After grad and it was too late to fix again. Be well.
