24,gqcrpjm,"This!! My buddy and i were arguying over if it was over or not and hes brought back the ""i been investing for years"" argument to prove his point, but he didnt even understand volume. He was like, yeah but there was 100 million in volume and theres like 60million shares so the shortseller have been able to buy back. I tried to explain to him that if they are 50% shorted, and that the 100 million volume (on that particular day) could be 60 million shares traded 1.8 times or so , and he would have been right, but it could also be only 20 millions shares traded 5times, and that if there were more shares held than needed to cover, there is still people who are fucked in the endgame.

He bet the run was to fall back down when it started going up in the 100s again after going back down to 40 .

I don't think the GME squeeze is about bond yields at all. The shorts can't get out easy and the use of GME as a wealth haven has only exacerbated the problem from them.

Not all Shorts are Hedge funds, not all Hedge Funds are short. While some companies are getting hurt by this rise, other huge institutions are raking in money because they own it.   


Most hedge funds don't deal in stocks at all in the first place. 

The other thing I think people don't quite get is that hedge funds are small. The largest hedge fund in the world is like $75 billion. Meanwhile Fidelity, Blackrock, Vanguard...owners of GME have a combined $17 Trillion in AUM.
