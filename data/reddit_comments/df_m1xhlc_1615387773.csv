46,gqg7yzz,"I've been holding it at 380. I've been holding it at 40.

As long as you don't scare yourself, just hold and it'll go up.

I've experienced all the lows and all the highs.
The highs will come again. Always remember in those difficult moments of doubt:



It feels like Thanos have snapped his fingers.

But I'm holding.

Even through all the pain, I'm holding.

Most of us know the hard truth the billionaires have always been running the world..

Even after 2008, they remain as arrogant than ever.

But the manner they have done it this time.

They have crossed it.

Blatant.

Utter contempt.

In our faces.

I can't walk away not giving my all.

I can't live with myself.

I'm angry. 

I'm pissed.

But I'm never giving up.

You can take away every last dollar I have in GME.

But you're not going to take away my fight.

You can laugh all you want.

You can mock all you want.

You can bot all you want.

But this isn't a joke to me.

This last effort will stay. 

It will never go away.

It will irritate you.

It will test you.

It will break you.

Wanna break me? 

Don't bother. I'm already broken. 

I've got nothing left except my fight.

And that's what I'm keeping with me for the rest of my life.

Good luck.",22,0,1615387781,messylikemessi
