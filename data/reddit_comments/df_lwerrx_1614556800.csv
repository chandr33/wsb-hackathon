4,gpgytkw,Something you missed is that qnx is a micro kernel. Any non micro kernel doesn‚Äôt make sense as a self driving cars os as the increased risk of a faulty product causing death is a big deal. It‚Äôs also the only non open source micro kernel that exists with the only thing even close being google‚Äôs project fuschia that is in early alpha. This forces car manufacturers to build on qnx now and once competitors do exist they will be unwilling to spend the man power to switch platforms leading to bb being completely entrenched in the industry,7,0,1614726134,Thanhansi-thankamato

10,gph1afv,"You dd is kind of lacking on details. Cylance isn't going to win the cybersecurity marketshare against companies like crowdstrike etc. They are considered an inferior product and crowdstrike is gaining lots of marketshare, while cylance growth is flat. 

I think they are going for a niche, which is complete package for automobiles (os, data, security) and then try to move to IOT.  

I would need to dig deeper, but this DD really needs to go into more details.",2,0,1614727369,bakamito

20,gphff4f,Yes. But they aren‚Äôt really important to mention because they have been clear that it isn‚Äôt up to manufactures whether they use it. It‚Äôs up to whether Apple wants to build something inside their car.,2,0,1614734630,Thanhansi-thankamato

26,gpis332,"The argument that $BB is low because ppl think it just makes smartphones....it‚Äôs a really weak argument. 

What about all the companies that the general population literally doesn‚Äôt think about at all? By this argument are they undervalued?

$BB is a loosely connected set of companies that were bought and brought under the same name. They don‚Äôt seem to communicate across divisions that well, and my bet is that the end result is that $BB gets sold off in pieces.",-3,0,1614768621,TheCloudTamer
