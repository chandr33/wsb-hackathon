30,gqajgnr,"1. You misspelled quantitative.
2. Your handwriting is messy. Type it up so your audience can read it. Even if your handwriting is perfect, typed out will always be better.
3. I tried to work through your method, but I didn't read the written stuff. If you could explain your method succinctly, concisely, and clearly, this would be great.

if the goal is just to determine a time bracket of ""when"", i can see how this could work

Just a few questions,  have you taken historical data and then measured the outcome error for different periods in a down market and a sideways consolidation?

69,gqbjbsp,"Thank you for this detailed post. I’ve been using your method for about the last 2 weeks. It’s so interesting to see the cycle of 5 candle to one red candle variation in GME. I’ve been able to scalp GME using the 6 candle method in the one minute timeline. I also bought shares to hold on a GME “dip” a week ago, also using the 6 candlesticks on the way down to determine my entry. This method, if understood and applied, is a safer way of trading than choosing any random entry point. It also allows me to find good exit points, and wait for peaks to form by checking the candlesticks. It is also simple and straightforward for me.",1,0,1615292649,xylo_fone
