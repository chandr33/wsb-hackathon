2,gqh8m5f,GameStop merely sells games. Roblox is the game. And they sell their own games inside the game,9,0,1615402145,ScreecherSmith2
3,gqh8mcc,RBLX is a more reliable alternative method to GME if you are worried about GME trading being halted again. Change my mind. (but GME to the moon don’t get me wrong),3,0,1615402147,jonnyt123_

10,gqh9nzt,"I'd think it's more of a convenient opportunity to take advantage of. Obviously there's genuine hype around it, but there's also a metric shit ton of brand new accounts hyping roblox as well.",3,0,1615402566,No-Adhesiveness-1178

12,gqhaxnw,And there are also a metric shit ton of new accounts pumping rockets and GME. Has it occurred to you that maybe there are people that don’t care about GME and want other stocks?,1,0,1615403091,turtlehater4321
13,gqhbc0l,It has. All I was saying is that this is a fine opportunity for GME shorts to capitalize on by adding volume to the hype.
