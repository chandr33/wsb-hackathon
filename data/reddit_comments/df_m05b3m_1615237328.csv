8,gqhz7rv,"Plot twist, Biden’s policy changes are temporarily increasing the price of oil regardless of the Saudi attacks. He’s reduced US supply by stopping certain drilling and increased demand with the pick up of air strikes. In addition, the process to extract materials for EV batteries and build renewable energy infrastructure requires oil/gas/coal (at least in the short term). Further increasing demand. Tac on the reopening of the economy and pick up of travel and you have increased oil prices. My theory at least. 

Look into gun and military defense stocks too because they are also having the opposite price changes of what you’d naturally assume with democratic policies. I could elaborate on these but I won’t unless someone asks. 

I’m up ~80% on oil stocks and erx, ~50% gun stocks, and a smaller ~5% military defense stocks for now. A lot also pay good dividends",1,0,1615413492,Common-Worldliness-3

10,gqzv5wf,"Man... I would not be playing this area that's so pipeline dependent during a pipeline hostile administration. Much better oil and gas to be in.

You are not only betting oil goes up (a good bet) but the democrats decide they like pipelines while they are currently targeting them.",1,0,1615800145,WaltKerman
