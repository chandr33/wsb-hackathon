0,gqdy32f,It’s tribalism at this point. Anyone who isn’t constantly shilling and talking exclusively about GME is an enemy for them. That’s it. Look at his comment history.

&gt;My thesis is that they've killed liquidity. There's still some demand, but it's mostly the same few shares being traded back and forth since a lot of them are locked up in diamond hands. It's why you are able to get random explosive movements, but I don't think they realize the kind of fire they're playing with.
