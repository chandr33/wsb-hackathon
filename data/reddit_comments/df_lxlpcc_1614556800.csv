I'm not talking about every stock. I'm talking about the ones that are randomly getting pumped on this sub, and then getting reported about as ""the next short squeeze"" by CNBC and the like. Like skt. If you got in a couple of days ago, you're going to make some good money. But anyone getting in later is probably going to be holding bags. 

But yeah, the stock market is basically a casino. So as long as you're only risking money that you can afford to lose, it's all good.
