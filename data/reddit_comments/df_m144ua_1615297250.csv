* Investors will be closely watching Treasury sales in the coming days, with the U.S. planning three debt auctions totaling $120 billion. The sales will test appetite for the safest debt after last month‚Äôs poorly bid auctions sent shockwaves throughout global markets and short bets climbed to a record.
   *  Low demand at a seven-year bond sale last month was a catalyst for driving yields higher, so today's auction of $58 billion three-year notes will be closely watched for faltering demand. There are $38 billion of 10-year bonds slated for sale tomorrow and $24 billion of the 30-year instrument on Thursday. Analysts still see the yield on the 10-year Treasury hitting 2% on a rapid repricing back to a normal economy.
