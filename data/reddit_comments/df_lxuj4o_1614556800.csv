10,gpp5ped,Can you help me understand the inverse aspect of this fund? I made a little on my first options play on sqqq and suspect it will continue to rise of we continue to see losses across the board but will go down when the market is going up. Is even close?,3,0,1614892029,BeachedElectron
11,gpp5upx,"Do not buy 3x ETF's until you understand how rebalancing works. If you still want to buy 3x ETF's, you do not understand how rebalancing works.

Do not buy 3x ETF's for long term.

Do not buy 3x ETF's during volatile trading swings.

Do not buy 3x ETF's.

Write ups on leveraged ETF's always start with how good they are ""if you know with certainty how the market will behave on an extremely short timescale"". You do not know how the market will behave tomorrow. You can achieve the same stupidity without the rebalancing decay. Stay away. They are a carnival game.",4,0,1614892092,Beetin

I try to find the 3X ETF's for bad market days.  It's the multiplier to balance the offset loss.  Sometimes you gotta hedge against yourself for insurance.

ETF's work both ways.  There are some to hedge against a bad market and those that win in a good market.  Just gotta read the prospectus and see how they are set up.",5,0,1614892616,Guilty-Ham
14,gpp730z,"There are 3 inverse proshare funds (PSQ -1x, QID -2x, and SQQQ -3x).  PSQ will move equal but opposite to the nasdaq.  Ie nasdaq +2%, PSQ will be -2%.  QID is leveraged to move 2x, so ~4% in the previous example and SQQQ is 3x leveraged so ~6%.",3,0,1614892619,noneesforarealaccoun

20,gpp937u,"&gt; Not many know with certainty how the market will behave.

Markets are, in general, range bound, cyclical, and impossible to predict on short timescales. Leveraged ETF's are like ""how can we craft the worst option given that information""

3x ETF's are fine for very short term hedging. They are horrible in general, and the longer and more often you fuck around in them the more guaranteed your losses are.

&gt;Yes the economy is fine but the stock market and particularly the tech industry are going to continue to see plenty of red days in the near future.

&gt;you‚Äôre gonna wanna go balls deep in $SQQQ

&gt;SQ is no where even close to its 52 week high

29,gppcbxu,"&gt; What is wrong with you? Pissed you didn't buy em?

I can't express enough how OK with not trading leveraged inverse ETFs.

You can enjoy your gains from today. Leveraged ETF's over any significant timescale have awful returns, Leveraged inverse ETF's even more so for obvious reasons (stonks go up), so you want to play with them over and over you are a special breed.

I'm going to sit quietly with a few LEAP puts on specific companies I think are overvalued, and calls on everything else.

If you are beating the norms, congratulations, you keep doing you.",-1,0,1614894918,Beetin

I'm so intrigued.",6,0,1614895139,Beetin
31,gppd2y0,"Thank you. These probably rebalance more often too. So you cant expect any trending here, other than moving oppos the nasdaq.

34,gppffz9,"I'm new to all this but I saw sqqq being and inverse of the market and saw consistently green when the rest of the market goes red. Had a feeling it would jump after powell's lack luster appearance as the markets reacted.

I know RH bad, but look up sqqq and you can trade options on it. So I bought a contract in the morning at .36 and sold it for .9 ish a little after the peak.",8,0,1614896318,BeachedElectron
35,gppfw6u,"You are exactly where you belong.

What are you doing is one of the riskiest, most convoluted option trades.

SQQQ is a 3x inverted ETF of the Nasdaq 100. That means it is an artificial soup of other options, derivatives, etc in order to inverse 100 different stocks.

You are..... buying options on options.... without even knowing what the option means, let alone the underlying security.

I don't even know how anyone is selling SQQQ options for you to buy..... every part of this makes me want to run. I assume you'd do this as an extreme hedging action in a bigger portfolio.  It is way above my paygrade though.

You saw a single day 250% returns on your bet. I have no advice to give.

If it works, it ain't stupid.",12,0,1614896525,Beetin

Pray tell, what is this fund for then?",2,0,1614896997,BeachedElectron
37,gppik5l,"SQQQ is meant for short term bets (less than one day) against the Nasdaq 100. 

You can see why if you look at the 5 year return.

SQQQ intraday call options.... I have no idea... I assume you can only fuck around with highly liquid, high volume options, and can multiply the already volatile security even further. You'd only do daily or weekly options. I imagine you are looking at -100% to +200% daily insanity on most of them.

It sounds like some extreme gambling and a ton of fun. I'd love to learn more but never let it near my money.",5,0,1614897788,Beetin
