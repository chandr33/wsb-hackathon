3,gq9987j,"I get this.  My broke ass could only buy one share at 155, and it's about the same amount I would spend at the casino anyway, so it's pretty much the same thing.     
Nice to see it finish in the green though.",6,0,1615238396,iwasneverhere43

25,gqa1e3c,"My fellow ü¶çbrother, we will be standing by your side.  The DD at the beginning said there will be dips, shills, media cursing us, market manipulation and every dirty trick in the book thrown at us.  

The DD is rock solid, hold and buy the dip was the call out.  I don't know about paper hands but my momma ain't raise no bitch, retarded ape maybe but no bitch.  

The most amazing thing I could have never in my wildest dreams seen coming was a band of brothers coming together liking a stock and shaking the very foundation of the system. Even more so staying the course and not breaking.  Stocks like tesla go up thousands of percent and no one bat's an eye, but let gamestop go up and everyone loses their shit. 

I imagine the HF's felt the same way, who would have thought.  

My son told me in Nov to buy gamestop, I said he was out of his mind.  Then seeing about all the people being brought in headed by RC... I should have got in sooner, but I'll be here long term.  I love a good comeback story.",1,0,1615252629,TutekTheLegend
