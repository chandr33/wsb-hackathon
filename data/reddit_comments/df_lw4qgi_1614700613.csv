14,gpfchod,"[The ape didn't get much DD. He was holding too tight, or movin' too fast. His idea of financial advice was rocket emojis and other apes cheering him on. He had only two ways out: death or squeeze](https://imgur.com/a/9gRobti)

[January 2021: DFV's portfolio was coming under frequent shorting. GME was starting to dip ... February: DFV orders the apes at WSB to buy GME stock, claiming it was undervalued. The stock mooned immediately, guess he really liked the stock. The hedgies tried one last time to bring him back to the fold. And if he sold, it all would have been forgotten. But he kept going, and he kept winning it his way, and they closed robin hood. They lost him. He was gone. Nothing but sporadic updates on WSB, showing the rest of the apes how to not fold. The hedgies knew his name by now, and they were scared of him. He and his apes were planning gamma squeezes all the way to 10k
