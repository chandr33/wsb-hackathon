7,gpgui0i,"Yeah, I wasn't sure when to cash out. After the second halt (or was it the third? Like 30 minutes prior to market close), I realized I was being greedy as fuck. Cashed out. Will use the 3K to try some more moves tomorrow -- just not sure what.",3,0,1614724061,phillythompson
8,gpguxlu,"good job. you locked in profit, so don't look back! maybe buy a few shares on a dip to reinvest in the company that gave you them tendies in the first place, and see where it goes! I tried to fomo on those calls at open but thought was too expensive to buy into... boy was I wrong",6,0,1614724267,WhoLickedMyDumpling
9,gpgv7lk,"Yeah I'm new to investing. I was happy when I saw I was up 900 this morning. So I didn't want to get too greedy. 

Looking for more affordable calls tomorrow. 

I was a bit scared of options but I think I'd rather lose 150 flat out then buy shares for 1000 and have  them sit at 850 taunting me for awhile(forever).",3,0,1614724399,reeferparker
10,gpgv7ov,"Yup, I got scared this morning as it opened at $4.50 per call and then dropped to $3.00 pretty fast. Was going to sell, then I fucked up my order on TDAmeritrade and suddenly the calls were back up to $5.00.   


My fat fingers saved me.   


I am thinking take this and get BB shares? Or maybe some really dumb lotto options too.",4,0,1614724400,phillythompson
11,gpgvi51,"Yeah, good plan man.   


I started options in 2014. My first trade was NFLX, and I made $3k off $700. Then did CMG and turned $3K --&gt; $19k. I thought, ""wow, this is easy!"" since my first two trades worked so well.   


Got cocky.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost most of it.  


So, moral of the story: don't let your first trade give you false sense of confidence. It's all luck. Keep the greed in check, like you did, and you should be alright.",4,0,1614724541,phillythompson

ELI5:

Options are bets that a stock will hit a certain price by a certain date. In this case, I bet that RKT would be at at least $25 by this Friday. When I bought that ""bet"", the bet itself cost me $0.77 (think of it like buying a lottery ticket ).  However, they only let you buy ""bets"" in packs of 100 -- so, it cost me $77.00 per 100 pack bet and I bought 2 packs.

Then, RKT jumped a ton today. RKT price made it to $40.00 -- that's $15.00 over where I bet it would be.

Thus, the ""bets"" (or lottery tickets) are now worth at least $15.00 each (and remember, they come in packs of 100 so when it says $15.00, you multiply that by 100 and it's really $1500.00 ).

Had RKT price not made it to $40, but maybe just $24, I would've made a little bit of money because my bet was coming true just a little bit. Imagine buying a scratch off lottery ticket. Then someone scratches off one of the numbers and the lottery ticket looks like it's gonna be a winner! Suddenly, that ticket is worth more now because it's more likely to win. In my case, the price went up (which is the direction I was betting), and thus my option was ""more likely to win"". Had the price gone down, my option (or bet) was more likely to lose, and would've been worth less than the $0.77 I bought it for.

Does that make sense? I am sure people will critique the ELI5 but this is the most dumbed down version I can come up with. I am going to make a Youtube video to try and explain this lol",6,0,1614726371,phillythompson

21,gph588u,That‚Äôs not shit of what options is. You still have the greeks and if you don‚Äôt understand them you‚Äôre going to get fucked so i would advise you to at least google or YouTube it. For example even if the stock is up the theta can tear your ass up and you will still be losing money.,1,0,1614729380,_TidePodEater
22,gph5g67,"Yes exactly lol - same here. I got some of it so far, but all explanations I‚Äôve looked into do not go far enough and use terms that aren‚Äôt explained well enough either. I‚Äôm ready to sit down with a good book about it now and hopefully get clear and confident enough to give it a try!!

23,gph64w9,Ya thx. I wasn‚Äôt taking this as an in depth full explanation. I appreciated OP clearing up some outstanding questions I had about options that I couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else so far.
