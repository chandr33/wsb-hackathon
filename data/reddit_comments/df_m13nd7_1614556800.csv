6,gqbaswb,"&gt; My most paranoid fear is that whoever the hedge funds are that are currently on OUR side in this second round are simply doing a scheme to fleece even more retail traders/investors, and that they don't actually give a shit about triggering the mother-of-all-squeezes

copy pasting 

&gt; think about it this way - there is a chance for the long whales to become trillion dollar companies. why would they let themselves become someone elses lunch in future?

&gt; if they care about their future, which they do, they will milk this

If youre paranoid, bail, one of us will buy the shares &amp; leave you behind",1,0,1615285426,nomad80

10,gqbauma,"Son, let me tell you a tale about being a paper handed bitch. This comes from experience. Actually it happened yesterday. I had 50 shares at an average of 135.00. Me, the ""smart"" INVESTOR that I am tried to time the markets. I sold at 150 and thought to myself.. I'll buy back in when it dips. It never did. So I had to rebuy at 170. Then it went to 200 and I immediately had the same thoughts you did. So I sold again and said I will buy when it dips... Well it never did.. so now I had to rebuy again today at 220 (Europe). I now have less shares then I originally started with, and my average is at 220 instead of 135. Don't be me. Be smarter. Be a good APE. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM POTATO.",1,0,1615285470,Wolowizards

20,gqbb2b6,"DD that I previously saw from VWAGY short squeeze showed the top, and lasted for like 2 weeks to be able to sell around 70-80% of the top peak. 

I had that idea last week. I sold @ 103 to try and make a quick buck friday, and buy back in monday. Problem is I panicked when monday it shot up to 112 in the open and I was afraid of missing the next step so I bought back in.",1,0,1615285676,Ditto_D

22,gqbb4l6,"Here's the way I see it. Someone might lose $5k. Maybe $10k. Or whatever.

But is it worth the chance for a fucking dream? Damn straight it is. If you want normie trade profits then there are tons of other stock to be trading in. I'm on GME because it gives my ape brain a chance to dream of what it's like to not be retarded for a fraction of my insignificant life when it hits. As a wise man once told me
