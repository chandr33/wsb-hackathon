0,gqh43pv,See things like this are nice because I always know bits and pieces so I appreciate it. I knew about the 10% rule and the halts and stuff and something about not being allowed to short but I thought they couldn't total and only for that day the halt happened. I appreciate it!,2,0,1615400361,Jromneyg

24,gqh4420,"My Dear Emma,

You seem to be wholly absorbed in the one idea of getting your mister out of the Union of Degenerates and getting him home. While I feel grateful for your affectionate interest in his welfare, I must at the same time, chide you a little for your lack of confidence in the ultimate triumph of our cause‚Ä¶.I do not ¬†claim to be very patriotic‚Äîin fact I think I have done less than I might and out to have done‚Äîbut when I come to weigh the matter with a view of leaving the Union of Degenerates, I find it out of the question for me to do so. I did not enlist for fun or profit, and I do not stay now through any such motives. ¬†I want to see this Hedge Fund Confederacy put down; and I firmly believe ¬†that it will be; if not for ten years, it will in the end. I think, however, that the end is much nearer than we anticipate. Emma, do not permit yourself to make tendies without dipping sauce or entertain practical thought in these trying times, which you will have occasion to regret hereafter. Do, for my sake, distinguish yourself from the normies and the paper handed.
