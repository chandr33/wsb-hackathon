90,gqhhttq,"I remember the 2008 crash. I was just about to graduate university and enter the job market. Except, there were no jobs. Graduation was not a happy event I worked hard for, it was a ticking doomsday clock. I graduated with student loan debt, no job prospects, living on my own off of $550/month, $500 went to pay for my rented room, $50 went towards food. I often went hungry and got so skinny I could count my ribs. It was appalling. I had to go like this for over a year, with no idea when it would turn around, and make that meager cash stretch as long as it could. I was a single guy, all alone, nobody cared, nothing I did worked, and my money was bleeding out by the day. I sometimes cried myself to sleep out of helpless frustration. Money was life. It put food in my stomach which enabled me to live. When money runs out, life ends. If things got to the very end, my plan was to eventually go out into the mountains, dig a deep hole where nobody could find me, climb in, cover it up, and kill myself.  
Fortunately, I got a call from an older friend who was looking to hire talented people and he thought of me. He interviewed me and I got the job. That's when my life turned around and things started getting much better. I could finally buy food without worrying about if I was splurging too much on a $12 sub sandwich for lunch.  
The people at the banks who gave out subprime mortages like candy to chase after their short term greed and caused the economic collapse of 2008 are responsible for causing us to suffer. They're still walking around and working without a shred of accountability. Anytime we can stick it to them and make them suffer and lose money for what they did in 2008, I am 100% down. These fat cats never had to look at themselves in the mirror and count their ribs like I did.",2,0,1615405988,slayemin
