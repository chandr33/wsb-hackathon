2,gq5spns,"I've done my DD and come to the same conclusion.

RBLX is coming out of the gates overpriced.  Their market cap is half of Activision's and they aren't even close to their level yet.  The fundamentals just aren't there for the price they're asking.

With that said I have $16k set aside to buy RBLX when it comes out.",1,0,1615165054,Any-Passenger-3877

I make a great game, other people like it, buy Robucks to get stuff in that game, Roblox company makes money. Think minecraft with microtransancrions for in game items and Roblox gets a cut of everything. The best part, as gaming trends change, roblox can change.

I'm tired of buying these bucks because that's all this little autist has asked for for the past 4 years!  I've seen ages from 4-12 play, and yes they spend money. RBLX is more of a platform like Steam.  The games are made by small-time game devs and they profit off their own work. So that content is frequently being supplied.  RBLX does not need to blow millions in development on a single game title like Fortnite or COD. This means they take on less risk compared to the more mature audience that is dominated by the rest of the market. They are an unrivaled platform for a certain demographic, not a moon-shot game studio. 

And heck look at Valve's Steam platform (not public), they made their money off a few amazing titles and then built a platform to purchase and download games in 2003. Now, most of their revenue comes from the platform. They now only make games as passion projects with their extra tendies.
