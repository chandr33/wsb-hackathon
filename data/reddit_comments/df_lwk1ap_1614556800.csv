27,gpiwzut," I posted this comment in response to someone else, but will post here again. I don't know if I will be right in the end, but I have serious doubts about RIDE. Do your DD and try to answer how they get past their challenges with this design (note, I forgot to even mention the coolant issue, assuming it is an issue):

RIDE may go up in the short-term as people buy into their claims. Especially if they show the Endurance completing some difficult race it will give them some credence in people's eyes.

What I am very skeptical on, is whether they can successfully mass manufacture the in-wheel motor. There are numerous issues with it.

1. Unsprung mass is normally considered bad.
2. The motor in the wheel exposes the motor to more abuse and the elements. One thing to make a one-off version of it that you are able to show works, another to mass produce such a product.
3. The weight in the wheel means the tires will have a shorter life.
4. The weight in the wheel, I think, means that you lose tons of energy on bumps. Not good for EV efficiency.
5. Their pricing is weak compared to Tesla's CT pricing (although supply constraints might mean that pricing is not that important).
6. Fleet integration is very questionable advantage. Tesla is a top-tier software company and is working on fleet integration for the semi. No reason they can't do that for the CT (again the benefit RIDE may have is supply constraints on EV pickup trucks).

Basically, I think RIDE may be successful in limited production, but I remain very skeptical that they will ever achieve profitable mass production.

The in-wheel motor eliminates lots of the drive train, so in theory great, but already EV's minimized the drive train. With all the issues with putting motors in the wheels, not sure the benefit of it (whether significant or marginal) over the motor sitting in the body is going to result in a viable approach.",-1,0,1614772892,aka0007
28,gpizs69,"I agree with the unsprung mass, that will be an obstacle however I know the first non employee to ever drive the car was a representative from a tire company so I think they are working on some of those problems listed. With the exposed wheel motor concern I suggest you look at the testing videos they have on their twitter, theyre pretty remarkable",2,0,1614774962,Northeastlocal
29,gpj0wt8,"I saw the videos. The thing is, producing prototypes is easy, so when dealing with a difficult spec it can work. When going to mass production, suddenly you find that it is infinitely harder to make work.

I get it you can overbuild your tires, but then you are adding mass and expense (and you have not explained how basic physics does not result in reduced efficiency). At some point these choices don't seem to make sense.

Don't get me wrong, the in-wheel motors is a really cool idea as you have no drive train, but it just seems to create more problems then it solves. Also, is necessarily 4 motors really that much better then two? For a sports car with torque vectoring, it may be great. But at some point the additional torque is not that important. Maybe 2 motors with a simple drive train is cheaper and easier to build then a truck with 4 motors. Maybe the 2 motor one is actually better.",1,0,1614775741,aka0007

31,gpj1pph,"What is April? When the plan to go to production? They are only planning on limited production initially, so they will be losing money because they sell too few. My issue is more along the lines of them successfully getting to mass production given all the issues. Limited production can be sold to cherry-picked customers who are fine with the inherent issues. The stock might very well go up in the short-term, it is the longer-term this will, I think, all fall apart.

32,gpj2bo2,"They plan on going to production in september, they entered the truck in a 290 mile baja rally race in april. I think that will showcase battery life.

34,gpj3ipt,"Right, the race. I mentioned that in my prior comment. I told someone I think the price  might go up as a result of that and then I would think to buy Puts (looking at 1/2022 from $10 and down).

I really don't think the return on these trucks will be that great if they are breaking down due to a questionable design choice. Longer-term, they don't compete dollar-wise with the pricing Tesla announced for the CT. The one thing that they have going for them, is Tesla will be unlikely able to meet demand anytime soon.",1,0,1614777406,aka0007

39,gpjbjne,"don't see it like that at all . 

1 unsprung mass . not sure the weight of the hub motor so without that spec there is not credence to your thought . 

2 motor is sealed in the hub no abuse from the elements same as electric bike hubs and all other hub motors . 

3 the tires will carry no more weight then then any full sized pick-up . 5000 lbs either in the engine compartment or in the hub is not changing the weight the tire carries and handling will be better since it will have a lower center of gravity 

4.Telsa does not have a working pick-up . the so called truck telsa came out with was a failure dog to be more precise 

4. use in fleets is as they say around here is to the moon . fleet use is too numerous to list 

the hub motor has been in use for decades . this will be true 4 wheel drive with power at all wheels and adjustable power at all wheels . this will be a true 4x4 go anywhere truck . handling will be improved 

we will se how it does in the desert race coming up April 17th something telsa has never done with it not a truck truck

40,gpjictb,God I can't wait for truck guys to flip entirely on their head when they realize that electric motors shit all over ICE engines when it comes to towing power. Or torque in general.,3,0,1614784914,Epicpotato119
41,gpjiqno,"This is what I come here for, different viewpoints! How else can you know what you are missing.

1. I think the motors each weigh 70 lbs. As the weight is in the wheel, it would seem that weight would, subject to the cushioning of the tire, be directly acting on whatever the wheel hits.
2. Comparing to an electric bike motor is interesting. I guess you would need to know the weight of the bike you are comparing the truck to. If the endurance weights 6K lbs, then that is 1,500 lbs on each wheel. If a bike weighs 700 lbs (with the rider) then that is 350 lbs per wheel. Not sure this is so comparable.
3. Did not say the tires will carry more weight, just seems adding weight direct to the tire, means that you increase the forces of any impact the tire itself has. The suspension is not acting to isolate the weight of the vehicle from the motor. (sorry I am not an expert in the physics here, so I might be incorrect exactly how this works).
4. Saying Tesla does not have a working pickup truck, would extend to Rivian and Lordstown Motor. None of them have produced anything yet. Telsa at least has shown it can build and sell EV's.
5. As to fleet use, it is not clearly a competitive advantage, as I explained already that Tesla is doing this for the Semis so no reason they can't do this for the CT.

Regarding true 4 wheel drive with adjustable power at all the wheels, I admit their approach makes that simpler. With a two motor CT, Tesla can accomplish the same result via the method they use on the Model S (computer controlled braking to transfer torque to the opposing wheel) or they can use a limited slip differential. I am just not sure that having motors independently on each wheel will make a noticeable difference in terms of 4 wheel drive.

The desert race is also of limited value. One thing to build the in-wheel motor for the demo vehicle. Another to get it to work properly when you are mass producing stuff.

I don't like the stock and think they will, at best, find themselves selling to folks who can't wait for Tesla to catch up with the demand for the CT.",3,0,1614785086,aka0007

43,gpjspmy,"the comparable was to the weather elements of the hub not the weight .
2 the weight of 70 lbs per motor is not bad at all a typical tire rim weight is around 100 lbs so i do not see a big down side to the hub motor again lower center of gravity will help in handling . 
3 yes i can see the difference in weight at the wheel unsprung but do not think it's a major issue imo . 
4 XL is working on semi ,as are a few others . telsa will not be the only game in town just like GM is not the only game in town .
 now the 4 wheel being a major off road-er i can attest to having true 4 wheel as opposed to limited slip . now remember you're adding weight with an axle all that is adding up and have yet to see a telsa truck other then the prototype which really was not a truck . 
I like the stock and the plans they have and are moving fwd with factory , pre-orders and a time line to produce  . plenty of room in the EV market and  lordstowns will be around for awhile .

Tesla has a market cap of about $600B, which if they needed to raise $10B tomorrow would be &lt;2% dilution. They just don't need the buzz. It can probably only hurt them if something goes wrong.

You could be right about the weight of the axle versus the in-wheel motors.

Regarding the lower center of gravity, if the motor is center in the car and relatively center to the wheels then I think the center of gravity is the same. There is an issue with weight on the side versus the center that I think means any turning takes more energy and overall handling will be worse.

My biggest concern is how well will mass produced in-wheel motors hold up here. Again, it is easy to prototype, but hard to mass manufacture things (especially things that might have tight tolerances).
