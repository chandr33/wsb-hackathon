24,gpnta9b,"Yes, but no.         
After the first short block, there could not be another (for a short and distort, or ‚Äòshort ladder‚Äô). So they would have to wait for more up ticks.       
Also, there are def. whales playing to push this up and bank off the squeeze, too. So ssr helps them. The higher the price, the more options go itm - the more itm contracts, the more shares that *need* to get purchased (by options writers, *not* the hedgies).        
*And plenty of $40-$50 contracts are itm tomorrow.*

It‚Äôs like a Jenga tower with only one block each on the bottom 5 rows, and placing a restriction to not pull from any row above 7.
