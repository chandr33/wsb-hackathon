20,gq62552,"In your analogy the only way Palantir can give you a proper answer is if they already programmed the alternative options and used the algorithm to optimize for the best outcome. It's not magic, it's not groundbreaking, it's just fking enterprise software using statistics and bunch of other algorithms to get you the answer. Plenty of enterprise software companies do that. 

The reason to invest in PLTR is because of the portfolio of clients Palantir is amassing and the momentum they have. This software is a pain in the ass to replace. Buyers put their reputations on the line when they select Palantir. The high switching costs make this a great business in the long run.",1,0,1615170287,jsntx
21,gq62ef4,"So I wanna chime in here...
1st obligatory positions 175 shares(hopefully growing with every dip), 2 calls so long covid will be a memory

2nd I'm probably one of the few that has ever used the software.

3rd I'm one of even fewer that has seen and analyzed the underlying source code.

Given 2 and 3 I'm dumping paychecks into them (1). They have incredibly fault tolerant software and the underlying code is near beautiful. I don't use that term often when referring to code. But it is. I don't care how many wall street or banker Fu(k-bois want to neg or short palantir. I'm going to buy those shares on sale to the IPO price. I can't imagine anyone in big data/big industry not using this software the same way AWS has become synonymous with cloud.

22,gq62s15,"I wouldn’t say this is “explained slightly better” but you did decent. You forgot to mention a few things though...

Palantir specializes in deepfuckingdata analyses mainly for governmental clients. what does that mean? It means, for example, that to get detailed info on someone, all you would need is a name and license plate number and Palantir does the rest. It performs a deep search of all criminal, financial, medical, communication, and clandestine agency records on the target. 

The company’s tech helped locate Osama bin fucking Laden in 2011 and is being used to trace COVID-19 infections, track medical supply chains, and even predict outbreaks in pandemic hot zones. Think of the company as a search engine for deep analysis of petabytes (or millions of gigabytes) of data. 

You ALSO FORGOT to mention Cathy Wood AKA the MF MONEY TREE just LOADED up on PLTR during this dip. She bought damn near 10 million shares.

65,gq6d5ib,"That's a very good question, but the best answer I've got is who knows? Maybe tech in general is in a bubble and what were seeing is a natural redirection of value being redistributed throughout the broader market. Maybe the amount of stupid panic sellers for this particular company is actually high enough to keep the price down. Maybe it's all the insider selloffs. (Btw the actual amount individuals are selling is less then 10% of their portfolio. Just wanted to spend hard earned tendies on a few new teslas maybe.) Maybe gme really is causing a market crash. The fact is NOBODY really knows but what I do know is here we have a company with all this positive stuff on it, facts you can research on google, and everyone who talks shit sounds like they are seriously grasping at strings just to come up with a sane argument to not buy.
