4,gpnzrgs,Whatâ€™s the catalyst? Why do you think itâ€™s going to pop in the next couple of weeks?,13,0,1614874353,ItsYaBoyLaity
5,gpo0dck,Semiconductors have been fucking me hard this past month. Everytime you think you're at the bottom there's another trap door. That said I just want a win in the sector so I dont feel retarded for doing monthly long calls anymore. Calls are pretty cheap here. Fuck it,2,0,1614874619,wampuswrangler

12,gpob70h,"Yeah, this DD is severely lacking in a catalyst to justify buying such short term calls. Last time I bought into a stock like this I lost almost my entire investment, and have just been watching the stock steadily fall since. Luckily I put in play money so it just gets to live as a reminder that next time I see something like this, either buy longer dated puts or just steer clear all together.",4,0,1614879275,Ragnaroktogon
13,gpocx44,"Its just my dumbass opinion but a 10b cap for 5b revenue would bring p/e to about 35 which would be the low end of the industry average. 

I think low end is fair though since they are only tangentially related to semi conductors

Like other pointed out there doesnâ€™t seem to be any upcoming catalyst or anything, so it seems like a long term investment, not a meme or short term call options play. 

What the fuck do I know though Iâ€™m high as fuck",1,0,1614880014,CMDR_Invertedcross
