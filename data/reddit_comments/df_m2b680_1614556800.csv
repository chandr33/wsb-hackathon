8,gqi6kd9,"I think buying at $255 is not that smart and waiting until the mini crash even less, but I do enjoy hedge tears and maybe my ~$1000 kept the stock up a few fractions of a cent during the $40 lull.",2,0,1615416961,the_parthenon

10,gqi7d7t,Youâ€™re going to regret it. Gme went higher every day this week. Closed at like 250. B/c it was shorted today itâ€™ll be harder to the hedges to short it tomorrow so itâ€™ll fly higher than it was today. But I did sell amc lol. Amc reporting today was terrible so I feel like people are going to sell,2,0,1615417354,App2918q

12,gqi88xx,"I know you are probably right but I want to close out my Robinhood account and was not going to go through a stock transfer for 4 shares. Breaking even is kind of... poetic?

Really hoping it goes way up to $42069 for all you true hodlers. As for myself need the rent money.",2,0,1615417794,the_parthenon

14,gqi8fei,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.                                    We algorithmically cull certain submission flairs whose response is not above a certain threshold to try and keep the page clean.,2,0,1615417884,VisualMod
