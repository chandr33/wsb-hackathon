3,gpiwvpb,You can also generally go to a movie anytime anyday of the week while the NFL has limited games and a maximum capacity so not sure how you can reasonably correlate the two.,9,0,1614772800,zach2288

5,gpix36w,"Everyone seems to suggest theaters have to compete directly with streaming services? Not so. If you can stream from a laptop to a tv, no doubt someone will figure out a way to record the movie in the process. Then the movie studios will have lost their monopoly on selling to pirate websites and bootleg DVD's. 

Even if the demand favours straight to streaming for new movies, the supply of movies will favour releasing in cinemas first where they can charge full price without risking having their movie ripped off. They will only release later on streaming sites and accept some loss to pirates after everyone willing to pay full price has done so.

Cinemas will have a place in the market for the foreseeable future.",38,0,1614772967,Lord_Timujin

12,gpiyd40,"AMC reports after hours on March 10th.  I expect to hear good news.  Like every other business, they’ve likely cut excess costs from operations, boosting profits.  They’ve also reduced debt significantly, which decreases interest payments, again BOOSTING Profits.  They’ve been reopening, and demographics less susceptible to streaming (old people) are vaccinated first, which will be increasing revenue.   Yes they’ve had a long year, and yes there’s been share dilution, but net/net my money is on AMC.",6,0,1614773939,ConsistentAd560
13,gpiys67,"Avx or imax is probably the greatest way to see a movie. I've a got a 5.1 setup at home but still prefer my favourite directors or franchises in theatres. Maybe the drop before covid wasn't because we hated the theatres but because hollywood starting making sjw political garbage.  I'm a tree hugging fucking liberal and i still hated the last jedi. Fucking sucked. Never went and seen the third star wars and inadvertently the theatre takes that hit. Poor bastards.
