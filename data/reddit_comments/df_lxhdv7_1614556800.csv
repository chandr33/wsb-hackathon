9,gpn0pp8,"cool info, thanks for this.
maybe an additional column of # of contracts ITM at that price point?  so that one would easily be able to compare hedged shares vs potential shares owed.

Looking at the % of float, I would assume that options writers haven't actually hedged that much lol.",4,0,1614853496,domipal

I had this at one point, but didn't find it too useful. I may include it in the future.

That is most certainly the case. For some tickers I've seen price points that had &gt;100% of float.",3,0,1614853659,pennyether

23,gpn2rgi,"I've been meaning to do something like this, but haven't had time thanks to work so I appreciate your effort. I'm a little confused about the 24hr delta, I understand that charm makes delta approach +-1 or 0 whether it's ITM or OTM as time expires. What I'm unsure of is whether or not this is a fair way to approach the problem since the options effected by charm will be larger on fridays than on a monday for example. So wouldn't this number move violently through out any given week? I'm also kind of surprised it's negative with out many ITM calls and OTM puts there are.",2,0,1614855448,I_sell_FDs

26,gpn3flp,"Yes, the 24hr delta flux values will tend to be larger towards the end of the week, especially if a large amount of the open interest expires that week.

I don't really understand how that is ""unfair"", though.",2,0,1614856060,pennyether
27,gpn40pl,"Maybe unfair is the wrong word to use there, obviously I think this is all great work, but my point is that while all of the other numbers will move slowly over time, the 24hr delta will adjust by the day, so it's hard for people to us that in any reasonable model though I honestly don't have a better suggestion besides graphing out the 24hr delta by day if no change occurs and that seems like substantially more work, which I know I don't have the time for so I wouldn't expect that level of analytics.

Also I'm probably not appreciating enough that the open interest per week is a small portion of the overall options chain. So this could be more negligible than I'm making it out to be. I'm unsure, just wanted to ask the question! :)",1,0,1614856581,I_sell_FDs
28,gpn4riq,"Ideally I'd be able to somehow visually represent a 3d cube with an axis for each of: price point, time, volatility.  Not sure how to do that just yet!

Flattening this down to 2d is possible, but makes it harder to compare along the ""pivoted"" axis.  For example, in each row I could show a spark line for each of gamma, charm, and vanna, where the x axis is price, time, and IV, respectively.  However, comparing the spark lines between price points becomes cumbersome.

On Reddit, I can't squeeze a sparkline into each cell, and so I just have to pick one point along that curve to go with.  I chose 1% for gamma, 24hr for charm, and 1.1x vol for vanna.",2,0,1614857234,pennyether
