93,gqihbrv,"Why does the volume and price action show shorts took up larger shares? My interpretation is that they covered a decent amount, but not fully. 

It's not impossible to have 50-60m volume with 15m active shares with high-frequency traders. 

However, to me, the fact that the price is swinging so massively on such small volume compared to January's squeeze, that tells me the shorts likely covered significantly. On the 22nd, we hit 197m volume. Today, we saw massive price movement on very steady trading volume. It wasn't a flood to buy it and it looked like shares weren't available. By my math, there were likely 50-60m shares in the free float on Jan 22, so 3-4x what was available was traded, and it was traded several times. As the price went up, volume dropped, probably because it's harder to get volume on prices like what we're seeing. 

If there's less supply, it takes less demand to move the price up. Same goes for drops. Less demand means they can drop the price much more quickly as we saw today with them blowing through every single buy order down to $170 like it was nothing.

I think the biggest sign that they didn't come close to covering even down to less than 30m shares shorted is the sales on the 25th. 150m shares traded in a day if the shorts did cover down to 14m shares according to S3. I still don't think that they're short anywhere near 100m shares as I think that could make it much harder to move the price on the volumes we're seeing.
