78,gqejv83,"Bru I mean currently. I'm pretty sure the consensus that DFV shares himself is that a $150-160 range is reasonable EVENTUALLY. The current company is not valued at that, the stock is. In part because people buying it except the transition to work. The new hires are good no doubt, but we don't know what they'll do, and we don't know how successful they'll be. Even $100 is some speculation, but $260 is far above ""price a year from now if everything goes perfectly"".
