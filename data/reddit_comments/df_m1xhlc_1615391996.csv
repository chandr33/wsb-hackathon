82,gqghra8,"Any idea why sell orders placed within my Roth IRA take so long to fulfill?

I placed a sell order yesterday before market close, and was told it would be fulfilled today at market open, but it is still open.

I invest with schwab and the sell order is about 4k split between a tech index and a target date.

This delay has killed my attempt at getting more GME at a decent price point. 

Any information as to why this is happening and he to avoid in the future would be greatly appreciated!
