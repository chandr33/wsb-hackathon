Nothing that's happening on the retail side is illegal. They can only punish illegal activities, so that's all on the HF side. We shouldn't really be too worried.

&amp;#x200B;

The HF are **legally obligated** to buy back the shares. It's not a matter of halting trades or whatever they *may* do. It's a simple fix - HF must close their short positions and buy back the shares they are obligated to. That's the only way this ends imo.",1,0,1615394155,DM-ME-CONFESSIONS
