29,gqfoy6y,"Yeah, sure. Institutional holders (mutual funds, retirement accounts, etc) try to maintain some sort of balance in their holdings. GME is a 'small cap' fund in most of them. When the share price grows, it will comprise a larger and larger portion of that portfolio. Depending on the risk associated with the stock and the intended weightings of the mutual fund, institutions will likely unload to balance out their fund.

That, and there's always the wildcard that is our US regulatory system. Their fuckery could know no bounds. But if they go full hands-off on this one, institutions will have to sell to maintain portfolio stability.",1,0,1615376141,Faedro
