1. If any security falls more than 10% within a single trading day, it triggers the 'Alternative Uptick Rule' for the remainder of that day, and for the duration of the next trading day.
2. While that rule is in place, short selling is only permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid (aka on the uptick).
