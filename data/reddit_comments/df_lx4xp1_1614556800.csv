I‚Äôm not a guy who knows about trading but from what I can tell from weeks of browsing here and reading about stocks, I don‚Äôt think anyone can really say what is going on and what the best plan is. Nature of it all really isn‚Äôt it.

You need retail acting in unison, while avoiding revealing the plan to the enemy or being accused of market manipulation.

52,gpl85dz,"The meme is it's all about Cohen, but the reality is...it's all about Cohen.

There have been numerous signs that the company is undergoing a long awaited transformation. We've already seen numerous signs of this; a plethora of new PC products on their website, several changes to the executive team and board of directors (many of whom are Chewy alums) with a focus on e-commerce and customer service, the departure of CFO Jim Bell. Yet the company has said little to nothing regarding these changes.


All of this has Cohen written all over it.

The logical time-line for a breakdown on their game(stop) plan for the future is the Q4 earnings report later this month or the shareholder meeting in June.

While we might not know the meaning behind a frog emoji and ice cream cone, what do know is it means...something. Something is brewing.

As far as I'm concerned the thing we need is to wait. Wait for the changes to fully begin. See the vision of the future. Take in the stench of Melvin's bowels evacuating as the realization hits that Gamestop is not dead, it's not going anywhere and it's rising from the ashes.
