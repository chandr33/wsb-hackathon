1,gpfh1xr,"I posted with the Discussion flair instead of DD because of that. If I am idiot, someone will point it out to me, but I definitely didn't do any DD-level research here, just stumbled upon the CDC link.",1,0,1614702653,Prudent_Reindeer9627
2,gpfhzlq,"Ahhh my bad. In that case - here is my discussion. 

Only people who shop at Albertsons are gonna get their shots their imo. It's about convenience. Otherwise, first thought to goes into my head is ""pharmacy"" and I'll go to Walgreens or CVS. So I'm not sold on the ""more traffic"" theory.

Their market cap is also pretty high to moon just from an event like that. I always look for small caps to indicate if a stock can really moon.",1,0,1614703068,captain_vee
3,gpfi8xk,"yeah, but in Washington for example CVS and Walgreens aren't offering it. Albertsons also owns Safeway and other subsidiaries that people shop in, including states like WA where they don't have another choice.",1,0,1614703184,Prudent_Reindeer9627

5,gpfj2ee,"Yeah that's a good point,  but Washington is a relatively small state. I'd be interested to see what other states are excluding cvs/walgreens from the list.

I live in a huge state and we've got shots in cvs/walgreens plus random pop ups like sports stadiums.",1,0,1614703540,captain_vee
6,gpfjhsa,"Safeway is everywhere tho and once its ""open season"" in May, it'll be like the flu shot without an appointment needed. I got 10  call contracts at 30$ a share expiring in December. Worst case I only lose 500$.
