Hedges borrowed 900,000 new shorts today, **THE MOST EVER THIS WEEK**. https://i.imgur.com/d5YnVtn.jpg

They have a coordinated effort to tank it in pre-market today since they can't have another day of GME opening 20% above yesterday's close.

**News media going through coordinated spin on GME:**

""The golden period of going long GameStop stock is largely over. Shareholders should sell now and take profits, and everyone else should look for better opportunities in the consumer goods industry."" - Motley Fool

""GME has rallied by around 1150% year-to-date. That said, the stock has lost around half of its value from its late-January intraday peak of $483."" - Reuters

**TLDR; THIS IS THE MOST BULLISH SIGN THAT SHORTS ARE RUNNING SCARED AND BACK TO USING THE SAME TACTICS AS IN LATE JAN WITH FUD / LARGE SHORT POSITIONS.
