1,gpk4rbu,"yeah, the free version of tradingview is kinda limited but it's been my best friend from the beginning since the data is more raw. You can compare prices across exchanges for assets and it basically just acts as an objective lens.",2,0,1614794565,CAT6_

9,gpkoimn,"Buy some BRK shares as they crumble.  -old enough to know I missed a great buy on 9/11 as BRK went tanked for just a moment, but they halted trading.

I'm wondering how much in loans from the 2B2F banks are going to default causing failures more widespread...  Remember Lehman failed with only 4% of their mortgages in default.  31:1 margin buys of MBS's can do that to you.    

What's the margin on the hedgie's double-down shorts now?  And who is holding the bag on those billions?   They didn't cover, they doubled in the hopes we'd walk away from the table...our table, our tendies going cold!  Gimme some rocket heat, warm these tendies up.",1,0,1614803107,555-Rally

16,gpl4ssy,"  I thought about selling, and then I was like Naawww!

It's gotta piss off those pussy hedge funds, that $GME hasn't dropped below $121",1,0,1614810247,EasternPrint8

18,gplewap,"Is there any way we can see where their options are sitting at?

I feel like every time we try to climb by $10 or so, there is ALWAYS huge resistance that prevents us from closing above 110 or 120.

Now that we've hit a close for 120, I feel like we're gonna be battling for 130 now.",1,0,1614815162,TOKYO-SLIME
19,gplljth,"Yes. I posted this in the same thread. Every 10 dollars puts another set of options ITM. So there is a lot of pressure to keep it below those $10 incriments.

Look on yahoo finance. Options details in GME. Call options. Strike price is the option value and the open interest are the options waiting to go ITM to exercise. Look how many we have between 120 and 150. This will start the feedback loop.",2,0,1614818826,WillSmiff
