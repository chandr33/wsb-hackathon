29,gqje9h9,"But it isn't one hedgie. Lots of different hedgies with different agendas. Apes can do what they want but buy and hold for the squeeze is not stupid either.

The short today was a low liquidity environment. Very clearly many/most MMs pulled their bids and the sellers went in. Show me another day where you have this level of price action on that small of volume? Usually 400,000 share candles will max out around $8-$9. During the short? $40+

Note that they tried hard on the short side:

1. when trading resumed after the halts both the bids and the offers were significantly below the halt, which is abnormal.
2. there were millions being thrown on the asks during the run up

If you calculate out the volume from during the drop and after, you'll find that the buy volume is much much larger than the sell volume - almost 3X.

Lastly, the open interest on calls for this week and next are huge. So many, in fact, that were GME to close above them all there aren't enough shares of GME in existence to fill those options. Forget the MOASS, this would be the MOAGS. So the MMs had to get the price down too.
