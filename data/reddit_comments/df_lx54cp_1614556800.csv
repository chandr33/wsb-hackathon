8,gpl07h4,"I'm in both and it's getting annoying af to see people everywhere trash talking or being shills because people invest in other companies besides GME, it really makes me reconsider my positions, we became that which we were fighting against. RKT has a lot more potential to be profitable in the short term than GME, and I know when I cashed out some of my profit yesterday from RKT I threw it right back at GME. GME is not moving, it doesn't even have the volume to make any significant movement at all, it's one thing to be a tard ape which I'm proud of but it is another to be financially irresponsible hoping god works a miracles and makes a squeeze happen with only 18 mill volume. GME was not and will not be the only squeeze in history, and you guys going from stream to stream and commenting on every post talking trash about people investing in other stocks won't make the squeeze happen any faster, it only shows your age and how immature some of ya'll are.",27,1,1614808175,T1Fak3r

18,gpl1wy9,"I know sometimes english can be a hard language to comprehend, but I think you missed the part where I said I sold for a profit and still hold positions in both. You are a fine example of the demographic of people behind the GME movements, ""If YoU hAvE OtHeR StOnKs U sUnK"". I bet you still using robinhood and buy 1 share every day just to see the confetti falling down on your phone screen.

the dividend was just the way for forcing shorts to cover, now we're here. you are saying the 1$ dividend is enough to increase price last minute?
