60,gpfc91g,"The OI shows us that if it breaks 200 EOD any day this week, that gamma will force 250/300. The issue being that it needs momentum beyond that because the chain goes to 800 and breaking 200 sets the timer to that Friday for the 800Cs. This is not going to ramp up like it did last time, I think it's going to be weekly steps with whales searching for retail support like 40 -&gt; 100 with a big play right around earnings 03/19 or 03/26",4,0,1614700513,kunal18293
