Would you know their exposure in China? Obviously a huge market that needs tapped.",3,0,1614874203,Junkingfool
4,gpo0pvl,"They‚Äôve actually been making pretty huge investments in China and Asia since the pandemic started. [Revlon investing in China as the pandemic started](https://www.glossy.co/beauty/inside-revlons-china-re-entry-playbook/)
I think it‚Äôs pretty amazing that despite being in the worst market environment and laying off people they had the foresight to make huge investments in the Asian markets. 

Those investments are now going to start paying off in a big big way. [pent up demand in China](https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/china-pent-up-cosmetics-demand/)

Following the China trends is one the reasons why I‚Äôm so bullish on revlon in America. I think we‚Äôre going to see the same trend where Americans have significant pent up demand coming out of the pandemic.",2,0,1614874770,musicantz

6,gpo1p36,It‚Äôs happening now. Texas and a few other states just went to 100% open. Even democrat states have been loosening restrictions. I think now is the time to buy in because it‚Äôs still trading at a discount.,1,0,1614875189,musicantz

11,gpo6sfq,Revlon's been trending down long-term even before the pandemic. Stop with your nonsense.,5,0,1614877381,Testruns
12,gpo8i8n,You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs been losing market share over the long term. I still think there‚Äôs upside over the next year or two as a rising tide floats all boats. The tide is coming for cosmetics where it had left them behind. The next few months could see them rise significantly even if the forever term prospects aren‚Äôt perfect. I also think they have made significant investments in foreign markets that could improve their position. Traditional western glamor brands are popular right now for Asians. As more people enter the middle class they‚Äôve taken on more western fashion choices.,1,0,1614878125,musicantz
13,gpo8ugv,"I don't know much about makeup but that's the summary I've been given when I shared this post. That they sell to Asian countries for Western glamour but in truth it's a lesser brand. Anyway, great post and information. Good luck.",1,0,1614878272,Testruns
