7,gqh4hio," Is it possible to trade US stocks from the EU? 

Yes.

 I'm under 18, is that a problem and how can I go around that? 

It is a problem and I don't think you can get around it. You'll require bank account and age verification and depending on your country you might be required to put in your National Insurance number or similar so they can verify your age. 

If you're looking to get into trading because you're afraid of missing out on things like Gamestop, don't. The amount of money you'd have to risk to make anything worthwhile back isn't worth it. It's better to learn to trade properly and win smaller amounts every day than risk it all on a YOLO bet that has over 85% of people lose money on it (at least 85% too).",3,0,1615400513,-Richarmander-
