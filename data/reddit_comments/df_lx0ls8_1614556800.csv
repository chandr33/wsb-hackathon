I‚Äôve been browsing commenting here for 6+ years and I never thought I would see the day that a non-penny stock could go up 70% and a huge percent of users would be trashing it.

The crazy thing about RKT specifically is that this sub was obsessed with RKT after its IPO when it shot up past $30 and in the months following when it was trading sideways for no apparent reason, then when it finally popped it was suddenly a scam...?",207,0,1614795847,IWasRightOnce

5,gpk7rpe,Thank you. Seems interesting. I love gamestop but we really should be careful with conspiracy theories unless we truly become like Qanon. I hope the people on RKT made tendies and I hope the ones holding long term will make tendies as well!

6,gpk7veq,"It's an obvious conclusion, but it's one that still seems to elude a large portion of the community.

I still think the effort is worth it. If someone says ""I think that vaccines cause autism"" and the reply is ""I don't think that vaccines cause autism"", anyone looking on from the sidelines will just see that there is conflicting opinions on whether vaccines cause autism.

If you provide evidence showing that vaccines don't cause autism, people looking on will be much more likely to side with you.

Right now I think most people here recognize the baseless conspiracy theories for what they are, but it's still important to nip them at the bud before they take over. If enough people start believing nonsense, any rational commentary will get hidden through downvotes.",203,0,1614795906,pdwp90

I've been watching RKT since it topped out around $34 and dove back down to the low $20s where it has sat for quite some time. A lot of people got burned week after week expecting it to go back over $30 but it never did. I dont think it is a PnD.

Edit

To play into some conspiracies a little, rkt could be a useful tool for us (just like weed, silver etc) for Hedgies to take money and hedge in this companies that they could possibly already own shares in, sort of to dilute their concentration. I mean if they spread their money too thin it‚Äôs gonna be really hard for them to hedge against the next spike. And if that‚Äôs gme when they‚Äôre already burning through cash well then yeah. Sucks for them. But think about it. You think reddit has millions in cash to run all these companies up? Hahaha. We are just here for the ride and catching monies along the way. It looks like an aggressive strategy to really punch a bunch of holes in their armor.
