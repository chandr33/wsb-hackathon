1) Scour Reddit to see what stock retail investors are rallying around.

3) Just after the end of the quarter, but before your 13F filing deadline, sell the puts and buy a fuckton of stock instead.

4) File your 13F, indicating that you’re short (via puts), even though you are actually very fucking long.

5) Reddit, which likes the stock anyway, will see that you are short, get absolutely triggered and decide to squeeze you by rocketing the stock to the moon.
