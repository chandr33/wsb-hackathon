It pains me to see the naked patriarchal conformity in your choice of the food on offer in the above statement. 

If you believe that only the male genitalia is a delicacy worthy of consumption by your esteemed guests, I would like to bring it to your notice that many among us happen to be aficionado's of the female variety of the delicacy. 

If you happen to never have had the good fortune of perusing the said delicacy, post haste you should give it a shot. This will not only expand your palate but  also present your guests with the fortune of perusing the said delicacy thus bringing equality to the genitalia offerings in these dreaded lands.

With humble requests,
