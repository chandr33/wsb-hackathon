75,gpmyuxo,"AI might not intentionally take over the world, but it could fuck things up quite easily if people are not extremely careful with it

the danger comes when seemingly simple ""motivations"" (as i like to call them) lead to totally unintended behaviour

for example, if an AI's primary motivation was 'efficiency' then it might determine that humans are an obstacle to this.  if it had the means, it might then attempt to remove humans.

but i still think we're a very long way from AI that could actually threaten humans.  you'd have to be a moron to give AI control of a nuke or whatever

85,gpn1pkb,"the analogy comparing a toaster to a fighter jet is just wrong in that context. 

to use the toaster analogy, you would have to stay in the construct of ""cooking"" so to speak.   
with self improving  and self teaching / learning AI (which already exists) you start with something that doesnÂ´tr even know what a toast is, but giving all ingredients and tools.   
and rather sooner than later you end up with a 5 star michelin chef AI without ever  teaching the AI all the intricacies of cooking. it will teach itself and learn it all, just because it understood and built upon the basic principles. it all does this  on scale of speed impossible to match for any human. 

(sidenote: I doubt cooking will ever be the area AI will be pretty good at, but the example brings the point across). 

AI already can learn writing, reading, image recognition etc.

&amp;#x200B;

only because the current publicly available version of google translator is bad, does not mean AI is not worth the effort. a coouple of years ago, MSFT had a key note presentation where AI was able to translate chinese into english. in real time. speech to speech. 

also:  
using the evolution of human society and the time that was needed to  achieve this evolution and actually comparing this to improvement speeds of AI is ... ""problematic"" as speeds of development is ever increasing, no matter the topic. 

 it took but only a couple of years (relatively) to go from the first concept of flight to planes much that can reach the upper amtosphere. 

the very first programmable computer was built in 1941. now we have supercomputers with 415.5 petaflops. thats less than 100 years.   
and humans had to solve countless limitations during this time. yet development speeds keep improving. 

MuZero, a learning algorithm based on AlphZero, played / learned games without ever being taught the rules. 

Alphazero ""learned"" chess by playing it against itself for 24  hours. 

AlphaGo learned Go (a much more complex problem mathermatically than Chess)  in 3 hours.  

&amp;#x200B;

basically its evolution on speed.
