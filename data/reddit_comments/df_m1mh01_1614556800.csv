10,gqeg655,"Looks like they‚Äôll run it up tomorrow (WED) and drop it down going into Friday to try and not end up needing to purchase &gt;50% of the float due to ITM options. 

**TLDR: the high for the week is usually Wednesday and then we slide going into options expiry Friday most weeks because it only makes sense for this to happen based on retail trading involvement (yes most of you suck at trading FD‚Äôs). After 3/19 the laws literally change and that‚Äôs when the real fun begins**

**Buy 4/16 calls and hold on for dear life because that date gives you 21 days after the major 3/19 options expiry where the rules change and naked call sellers will take on extreme losses and get margin called**

24,gqeh6kw,"Don't worry, you're actually retarded.  You're assuming that all these call options are naked and have no shares covering them right now.  That's absolutely not the case, MMs don't sell naked calls without covering them as the price rises.

Let's say that you sell 10 naked calls on a stock that is currently $220, the strike price is $250 and there's a $50 premium (there's a ton of volatility that causes this).  Your break even point is $300.  As long as your shares are purchased below $300, you actually profit on this trade.  If you buy 1000 shares at $220 right now, your maximum profit would be $80000 because the highest you can sell them for (due to the sold calls) is $300.  However, this means that you'd have $220000 tied up now in shares, and you want that cash to be available still.  So you wait.  The stock rises to $250, you decide to buy 200 shares.  The stock rises to $275, you buy another 400 shares.  The stock rises to $290, you buy another 300 shares.  The stock reaches $300, and you finally buy your remaining 100 shares required.  Your total cost is $277000 and the calls get exercised, paying you back $300000.  Overall profit is $23k.  MMs still make money on this trade.

The reason they do this is because when they sell the calls in the first place, they're handed a huge wad of cash.  In my example, $50k profit from selling 10 naked calls that are 30-40% OTM.

If GME starts dropping instead of rising, they just made huge profits from selling premiums on what would become worthless contracts.  If GME stagnates, same situation.  If GME rises, they *still profit overall, just less*.  And even if GME rises, they still are able to continue to sell naked calls at higher strike prices, making money on the way up until it finally turns around and they make HUGE money on the way down.

The only way to break this is to make the price skyrocket with far less volume than what they can work with.  We're still not at that point.  We would essentially need to be breaking VWAP every day for the next week or two when looking at a 1d chart.  Can it happen?  Well, I think it still can.  But the likelihood?  I don't think so, because they're making money by selling calls and we're tying our money up every time we buy more shares.  Eventually one side runs out of cash to work with, and I doubt it's the side that gets handed money every time.",23,0,1615342428,MrStealYoBeef
