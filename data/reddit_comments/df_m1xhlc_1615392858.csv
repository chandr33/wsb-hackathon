4,gqgjvz3,"Just for contracts expiring this Friday:

Assuming we finish above 300, we have 49,824 calls expiring ITM. Of these, 7011 are at 300. 

This is the equivalent of 4,982,400 shares. The total float is only 54 million shares. That means 9 % of the ENTIRE float would be ITM. 

Next week the number of ITM calls (assuming 300) is 68,467. I‚Äôll let you put 2 and 2 together. Over 20% of the entire float is eligible to be exercised over the next 7 trading days. And this is all assuming we stay right at 300. Even more Open interest could be in play if we keep climbing",2,0,1615392860,king-of-caterpillars
