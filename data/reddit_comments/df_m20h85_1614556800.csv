39,gqgtpv6,"I also don't get how these ""expected open prices"" come out without anyone knowing the outstanding shares. Shit makes zero sense. Look at the market cap, if it's $20 mil or under, it's a lot safer buy than buying over that point. Most stocks trade at what, like 10-15x multiplier of revenues tops? Why does this one have people thinking it will go 20x+ lol",1,0,1615396739,CrashKeyss
40,gqgtwx3,Seeing lots of comments about how they only had 1b in revenue and a loss of 200M. Don‚Äôt believe that. They had 2b in revenue last year and they are up 500M last year. Wall Street is trying to shake you out with those fake news!,1,0,1615396817,SiegeLion

47,gqh35f2,"They literally have roblox toys at the store. Roblox is designed to have the games on the platform increase in quality the more players that are on the platform. This is due to the fact they introduced their devex program. It allows players to monetize games they make, and use the in game currency they make from their games and trade it in for real USD. The more players, the more potential money to make, the more drive for real world developers to hop on and make a quality game and make some money. It's a great way for developers to make money without having to get a big publisher.",4,0,1615399999,CreepyButtPirate
