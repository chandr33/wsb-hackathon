1,gqi140y,"I think I accidentally did something stupid wheel trading.

Step 1: Decide to wheel trade AMC.

Step 2: Open a narrow put debit spread to collect more premium (proportionately) with $100 in collateral than you would with $700 in collateral.

Step 3: Either wait for the credit spread to expire worthless, or if it looks like you'll be assigned toss in extra money for the collateral and sell the long put.

If it works, you get more premium proportionately while you do something else with the collateral. If you get assigned, you get to do stuff with the collateral on all the intervening days and get your profits from selling the long put to make it slightly more profitable than getting assigned normally while wheel trading.

Feels like I'm missing something obvious. Like either there's something in here completely stupid, or this is just how normal traders handle credit spreads.",2,0,1615414349,bd_one
