13,gph3cu6,"It was mostly probably an 'oopie we forgot to invalidate it earlier' but are now in face of media asking why he's registered. Most industrial/construction/business licenses are stipulated 'only for current employer' so should be filed to be removed when you leave, but usually they don't bother going through the effort, and upon the end of year expiry it just doesn't get renewed so no big deal usually.",1,0,1614728424,Sekioh

21,gph4nlt,I did. My question was is if it’s a normal practice in the brokering world or if the firm dropped him because he was under investigation. I can think of many other worlds where it’s not a normal practice to terminate their license due to an outside investigation,2,0,1614729090,AChipOnYourShoulder
22,gph4o2s,When you give up your position at a firm  it is natural for the license not to be good anymore standard practice across most of the bond insurance broker &amp; sales business I used to Broker Yachts &amp; boats in Louisiana which does pretty much the same thing.

36,gph6z0c,"Agreed. I’d add that I believe you get 2 years to find another brokerage to park your series 7, or other licenses at, if you have trading licenses.

The, “outside activities” comment I believe is intended to go along with the attempt to make DFV look bad. All companies that are FINRA regulated will have trading restrictions placed on all of their employees. They typically need to pre-approve trades, hold for longer than X period of time, and are required to have their trading accounts report to the companies compliance to track all activity on all accounts. My interpretation of them, “looking into” things, is to ensure that DFV AND the company were following those policies and procedures. Based on DFV, his hold time, and the fact that he had a license, I’d expect/hope that he’d complied with everything.",3,0,1614730274,NoseBurner
