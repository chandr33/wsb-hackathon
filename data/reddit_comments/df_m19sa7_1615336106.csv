1)  Yeah, I have seen that DATA but how are they gathering that DATA?  I want to see how did they achieve X, Y, and Z in order to formulate that conclusion.  Are they using the same DATA that is provided by FINRA/FINTEL/etc.?  Remember, there are conflicting S.I. #s through different resources. These are questions that are open-ended.

2)  Assuming that the positions are covered, then are we assuming that the party that is receiving back the loaned shares are now selling?  So are the returned shares being sold back onto the market or being held?  From my understanding, Institutional has increased their position as well as most retail investors are still diamond handing (Retail is an assumption).  This is why I do not believe it went from 120% to 22% SI as what it is being reported.

3)  Yeah I did read the link you posted.  It just explains the process but how do we know they're utilizing it to their advantage directly with GME.  GME is a weird stock right now when comparing with majority of other stocks and I would assume most people agree on that.   Everyone needs to understand that Research is to provide evidence, not to prove what is binary (100% or 0%; factual or not).  So that research is a hypothesis that is trying to explain something that exists with further data.  If it was a real research, then where are the limitations?  The next question is:  What is the success rate for them to cover all their positions through this method and/or in general?  We do not know because we're all hypothesizing and questioning the process.  At this point, the way you were presenting that evidence was assuming that they're using this process 100% of the time with a guaranteed win rate for them to cover.  But it seems like you're agreeing with me regarding mitigating risks and/or damage control.

Techniques Used to Circumvent Reg SHO

 The SEC has limited enforcement ability and seems to be content to allow Wall Street and the DTCC to police themselves. These are representative of techniques that are used routinely across Wall Street by almost all prime brokers. 

Examples are:

permitting important hedge fund clients to bypass the locate requirement when entering short sales,
creating and distributing easy to borrow lists that improperly included threshold and hard-to-borrow securities to the firm‚Äôs proprietary traders and clients
concealing FTDs through washed and matched trades, i.e. rolling over an FTD to another broker dealer

transacting illegal stock sales in dark pools off the primary markets to avoid NYSE oversight and to maintain anonymity

failing to reasonably supervise that locates were obtained and/or documented for short sales
falsely marking short sales as long on order tickets to conceal naked short positions,

falsely representing that they either possessed the borrowed securities or had located them for borrowing and delivery.

failing to make legitimate or reasonable efforts to locate shares prior to short selling,
entering into fictitious option contract to conceal naked short sales;

using the DTCC stock borrowing program as a means to conceal naked short sales,
submitting fake short interest and other reports to regulators;

concealing their activity through falsely reporting shares created through illegal naked shorting as shares in brokerage statements of investors as if these assets were representative of real shares
concealing their activity by issuing voting material to shareholders with nonexistent assets who have no corporate rights including the right to vote shares,

failing to comply with responsibilities and duties to investigate and report suspicious transactions to regulatory authorities

97,gqem95o,"Pretty new to this and have a small stake in GME, it‚Äôs too bad a lot of people hating on your response. It‚Äôs not clear what the actual short interest is. The question is, when will the shorts be forced to cover the majority of their position? My understanding is it is when the fees cost more than the price of the cover. Do we have any insight into that? 

Say the actual short interest is something in-between 140-22% and sits at 80%. Over the next few weeks we would see a lot of covering and margin calls and the price go up steadily, the question is what is a realistic moon share price in that situation? Given no halting on purchasing shares.

Could we see a 5-10k share price? I don‚Äôt think we can be sure of anything but the peak will likely be high and short lived",1,0,1615345170,christopher33445
98,gqemacv,"No model, mathematical or otherwise, supports this stock going to $100,000, or $10,000, or $5,000 for that matter. I‚Äôve heard the theories running around this sub and it‚Äôs nonsense; people say ‚Äú well if they HAVE to cover their shorts and we ain‚Äôt selling - they‚Äôll have no one to buy it from and would have to bid for it at these inconceivable prices and make us millionaires!‚Äù

Nonsense; the price won‚Äôt get there because there are market makers who‚Äôll sell them the stock for a lot less, and won‚Äôt let the price go to heights where they can‚Äôt make a two-way market. Again to be clear - the MM have no bias and don‚Äôt care if a stock they make a market in is at $5 or $5,000, but they need it at a price where they can find buyers AND sellers. The people of WSB don‚Äôt control the liquidity of the stock - even the biggest retail GME investor DFV, is [estimated to own about 100,000 shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/wallstreetbets-trader-keith-gill-appears-171517525.html), which is merely 0.14% of GME shares outstanding; so even if we assume that the rest of this sub holding together another 700,000 shares, it‚Äôs only 1% of the supply and even at $500 a share there will be plenty of people to sell. 

I‚Äôm not against the GME craze, I love it! But we must all do our DD and accept that when we so violently disconnect the relationship between the price of a stock and the value of the underlying company, it becomes nothing more than a pyramid scheme where we all buy it just to sell it to the next sucker to be left holding the bag - that is, left with no other sucker to sell it to. That‚Äôs what happened a month ago, and when it does there are overall a lot of people with great profits at the expense of a lot more people with a lot greater losses.",1,0,1615345188,JRyefield
