Porsche wins. Everyone else loses.  Big. As a result of its skillful financial engineering, Porsche netted itself more than $10 billion in profits in a matter of just a few short weeks.  It was money that was badly needed by Porsche.  Luxury car sales were plunging due to the crisis and Porsche was already saddled with significant debt.

On the other side of the trade, the hedge funds who had sold VW short quickly saw their collective losses exceed $30 billion.  ** [Hedge fund](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/3281537/Porsche-and-VW-share-row-how-Germany-got-revenge-on-the-hedge-fund-locusts.html) managers were “literally in tears on the phone” as they described “a nuclear bomb going off in our faces.”**",14,0,1615332904,da_muffinman

10,gqdzgmg,"They buried their fail to delivers in ETFs and through tricky options trades to throw the ultimate head fake that the squeeze happened at $400. 

They then secured a net long position and bought up tons of OTM calls they knew were being sold naked. Now they will release the kraken that is the true fail to delivers into the market (insane amounts of buying will result) because they are net long and this will roast naked call sellers 100x worse than they got roasted as naked short sellers.  This ends in a domino effect of liquidations and margin calls that drag the entire market down... likely ~21 days after 3/19 options expiry based on the DTCC and SEC / OCC regulation changes. 

This is all obvious, why do you think the laws are changing?

This is more than a short squeeze. It’s a 100x leverage, picking up pennies in front of a steam roller, naked call squeeze now.

24,gqe0psk,"They “covered” on paper without buying shares yet through tricky options trades. 

Other people believe short squeeze is over but the shorts haven’t bought shares. These poor schmucks who think it’s Squoze sell naked call options for free IV crush / theta money. 

Behind the scenes laws start to change because a storm is brewing. It’s to trap the call sellers. 

Person who was short and facing excessive losses buys all the calls from people who think the squeeze is over. Now he actually buys to cover and those calls print money and the guy who sold the calls and doesn’t own any shares has to buy 100 shares at market price to deliver on the naked option. Extreme losses result. 

Ultimate hustler move. Head fake the short squeeze. Hide the amount you need to buy in options market. Then once you secure a net long, buy to cover after the laws change.

Essentially shifted the squeeze from the hedgies to the naked calls. This Friday and next Friday especially is where we may see some insane buying action when call sellers have their other positions liquidated to buy GME at market price to deliver the shares to the in the money calls.
