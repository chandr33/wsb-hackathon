36,gqfzwd4,"Yea, Rod put out a $169 bull case PT in January.

But this is besides the point. I have no issue with most of what you wrote. I added the caveat of ""very bullish,"" understanding it's a ""best case"" type scenario that CUSHIONS the downside at 40 when combined with other factors, more so than a standalone justification in itself.

I‚Äôm saying when you weigh all the other factors, the ones that bring the price down to below 40, and weigh all the factors that bring the price above it - as a speculative gambler you won‚Äôt find a proposition with so much upside compared to downside (meme potential/marketing, a base of religious ideologues diamond-handing shares with unreasonable belief in 100k PTs, momentum-driven market in which narrative trumps fundamentals, weirdness with FTDs and hard-to-locates, underreported short interest, etc.)

Not every conspiracy theory has to be true, but there‚Äôs enough buried underneath when you start to add them all together to suggest some probability of fuckery/shenanigans.

I would‚Äôve rather had a discussion of that probability than the rabid back-and-forth between BOTH sides. The GME deniers were almost as na√Øve in their assumptions as the cultists, and more wrong in important ways ($$$).",1,0,1615383674,mr_wylie

It‚Äôs not one collective mass of ‚ÄúWall Street.‚Äù They're competitors. The orchestrators of this price movement are making a killing, and the ones on the backfoot will do their best to use the volatility to ease out of their positions, but some are going to get burned - and as they are forced to cover, it will be one factor driving the price up (among many). I could be wrong, and it's not really important. Because my point isn't about who gets burned or not, it's about where does the motivation push the price?

49,gqg1dto,"I‚Äôm not defending the worst conspiratorial 100k apes. I‚Äôm criticizing their na√Øve counterparts on the other end who are almost worse IMO because of how smug they are.

Also, the catalysts you point to (DFV and an ‚Äúunknown‚Äù entity buying upon CFO firing news) are not some out-of-the-blue unexpected catalysts. It‚Äôs baked into the more reasonable arguments. Rabid retail and belief in bullish ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù PTs creates price floor, then as the Ryan Cohen reality unfolds (insiders buying shares, key hires, fires, Cohen CEO, concrete plans, DFV + Cohen tweets) it starts to become a snowball in this Tesla world that we live in, with a not unreasonable chance of going parabolic again - which is what Mark Cuban seemed to be alluding to. Again, it did happen faster than most reasonable people except maybe DFV might have expected. But these catalysts weren‚Äôt some crazy black swan events outside of calculable expectations.

As to the feeling that your sub was ruined, I sympathize. But I also think that emotion dominated to the extent it overtook many people‚Äôs ability to see the value in getting in on GME again earlier, not wanting to be associated with ‚Äúapes.‚Äù",1,0,1615384479,mr_wylie

88,gqg52z1,"Read up on Greeks. Basically- the further out of the money your option is, the less its price it determined by the underlying price. Everything that is not delta is known as extrinsic value. 

Otm options gain value much more rapidly as the underlying actually approaches them (which would raise their deltas). Until then- it‚Äôs very possible for you to be right directionally but lose money or even on the trade. This is because the other extrinsic factors like theta or vega or both, are decaying on you. Vega tends to drop as a stock trades more sideways than it has been. As was the case yesterday.
