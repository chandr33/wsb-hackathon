Most cannot daytrade,so they cannot buy in the morning and sell in the afternoon. Its not about GME, its about how to avoid being manipulated",2,0,1614860155,Global-Sky-3102
1,gpn8zzs,Well you just hit $22 pre-market,4,0,1614860546,MassCasualty
2,gpnbncj,Up $7 in premarket,1,0,1614862371,Dazumbolschitt
3,gpnf6pj,"Okay, I think the disconnect is when buddy said they own stocks (assuming they meant shares) it seems like they are advocating to not buy shares as some people have been saying not to buy because Melvin owns shares and we would be helping them out. Anyways glad we're on the same team it's already up $3 which I'm happy for but also not because my money just came in today and now I have to buy the shares $3 higher lol..but still getting in there before it goes up even more!",1,0,1614864550,GlutenMakesMePoop69

13,gpnrl68,"&gt; Is this a P&amp;D? I keep seeing DD and odd comments about this... but there seems to be something funky in the air.

Yes, when you see a couple of guys going back-forth with same ""DD""... stay away ;-)",1,0,1614870760,desi_guy11

I don't state any of the positives on SKT",1,0,1614873519,bakamito
18,gpolghk,"I'm down 20% in 5 hours.....woohoo.  Fuckin hell, any stock I buy immediately fucking tanks.  And this is not an exaggeration.  I gotta learn to pick better stocks, the only green I have is GME right now.

This is money I can afford to lose and I'm certainly getting an education. :)  Still sucks to look at it and see all red!!",6,0,1614883601,rob0225m1a2

$30c for march 

$25c for april

get this to the top of DD",3,0,1614888245,zenexperiment
20,gpphti3,"Quit buying meme stocks and start doing real DD.  Head to sites like finviz and view the real financial data.  Find stocks you think are undervalued or will grow, find what you think the value will be or should be, and then you have your set buy and sell prices and follow through with that plan no matter what.

Any other form of investing will result in you losing money long term.

If you can’t or won’t do that then you are just gambling.

Most gamblers lose money, only very few make money.  The problem with gambling is everyone thinks they will be the ones who can do it right and make money.  They constantly think that just around the corner they will make their money back.",4,0,1614897436,Throwawayhelper420

22,gppubsd,"Honestly, besides GME and SKT I haven't bought any meme stocks.  I've have genuinely been trying to do research on the stocks, even the ""DDs"" on this sub for SKT were detailed enough in my mind that it made sense.  Admittedly, some of my early purchases were OTC penny stocks that were PnDs that I didn't have the ability to identify them as such at the time.  Though the first week, I saw almost 200% profits which I now know I just caught the PnDs at the right time.  


I've learned better now to be sure and am sticking to stocks traded on the exchanges. Again, this is money I'm okay to lose, though I would prefer not to.  It's definitely a steep learning curve that may prove beyond my ability to dedicate the time to.    


Thanks for the comment and candid feedback.",2,0,1614903651,rob0225m1a2
