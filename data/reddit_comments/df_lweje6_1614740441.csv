31,gphswpi,"Look up options details on yahoo finance. Look at March 5 or 18 dates. Go down to $800 strike price on call options. Open interest are the number of open contracts. For this week, if we reach $800, those 24k contracts, will turn into 2,400,000 shares being purchased, at $800. That will make a huge gap up from there, which should lead to a margin call, and then it's game over for the HF as we see a prolonged rise in price as the it mmoas.

What's interesting is the $120 strike price. Look at all those contracts set up for a massive chain reaction. One pushing into the next, that just floods the order book with buys. What can also happen is that the options writers will make a huge purchase of shares in the next day or so to cover all the ITM calls turning into shares.",12,0,1614741525,WillSmiff
