41,gqe2qda,"It‚Äôs not technically a random price. It‚Äôs the Market price, which is the price that someone is offering to buy at. So in a time of high volatility, many people trading at once, the market orders are sometimes filled at extremely low prices compared to what you see on the screen. What you see on the screen is the last price it was traded at, i.e someone bought and someone sold it at that price. To avoid a bad fill, set a limit sell order for a price you want to get paid. You will only sell your shares for that amount if someone sets their buy order at that amount or the market price is at that amount.",1,0,1615334726,jamesjay2

Everyone should be moving from Robinhood, if you don't pay for the product, you are the product, is the simple asnwer why nobody should be using RobinHood or other commission free platforms.
