Regardless, you will not pay taxes on anything until you withdraw it.

45,gphwo7u,"Good advice. Helpful post. 

What I would do is keep investing in stocks using my brokers app. There‚Äôs something so cool about the thought of managing all my funds through my phone, having my wealth in my back pocket wherever I go. 

There‚Äôs some great tech stocks, like gme, tsla, apple, google, tech etfs and they will all be in the red when the squeeze happens because hf will close their positions bringing the price down. Why own a house or a car when you can own companies? Physical assets decay, are subject to random taxes and require maintenance. It‚Äôs a headache and makes things less accessible for no reason. You can see some great reruns on dividend paying stocks aswell. Diversity is key üîë
