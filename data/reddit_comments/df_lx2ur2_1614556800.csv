Might sell some pltr and buy it",6,0,1614802006,NosPhoenix
4,gpkmgyi,Bought CRSR at 43.95. Waiting for it to hit 33 and go yolo with $25K. It‚Äôs been a rough month.,5,0,1614802213,Shoddy_Reporter_9647
5,gpkmtlk,"CRSR has been a huge disappointment. I'm at a loss for how to explain why this stock is behaving the way it is. It's a good company. I bought at the peak - $46 - and it has done nothing but bleed ever since, despite nothing but *good* news.",24,0,1614802368,GreatQuestion

22,gpl0j6c,"Same. I don't get it. It looks like a great stock. But I'm going to Warren Buffet this. I think value will pay off eventually. 

I'm down 25% but I sold a Aug 70c for $6.70 so that's offsetting more than half my current losses.",2,0,1614808320,Cargo_Vroom

27,gplflae,"I mean, aside from the fact that it was falling at all, what made you think it would keep falling past $39? It hasn't done anything to make itself less valuable as a company...",2,0,1614815520,GreatQuestion
28,gplglv8,"Oh no I think your mistaken. I'm retarded. Personally I think Corsair should be at least $50 a share. As both a consumer of their products and as an investor I have a very positive impression of the company and would say I'm very bullish on them long term.

Simply, I dont enjoy waiting. I'm just a newbie who is extremely aggressive with trading stocks and as soon as my intuition that CRSR changed from a 1 month play (a long play for me) to a 6 month+ play formed in my ape brain, I skipped ship.

 I gave the wrong impression on my og comment, I wasnt sure that it was gonna bleed, I was just too disinterested to find out. I just felt like there was other stuff weighing it down that I wasnt seeing.",1,0,1614816048,Doughnut_Minion
29,gpls1vs,"Similar story for me. It was my first play at the market, I bought in around 38 and sold just after earnings around 48. Bought back in at low 40s whilst pocketing some profit....but it just kept dropping and dropping. Just gonna hold it long term now.",2,0,1614822420,BaronBulb
