Making those puts worth a ton.

I bet it also triggered a ton of stop losses people had in place and freed up a lot more shares automatically that way.

And yes - the plus side is a lot of us scooped a ton of those shares up at that discount. What happens from here? Who knows. I think we (the retail holders) are sitting pretty at least up until the next attack.
