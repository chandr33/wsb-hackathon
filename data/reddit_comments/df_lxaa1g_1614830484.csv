2,gpm868p,mfs are mad they didn't make 1000% on rkt calls and 100% on puts even though it was an incredibly obvious play because they thought GME is the only stock that exists,21,0,1614830691,amathine

23,gpmdt8l,"Can confirm that United Wholesale Mortgage closes insanely fast. It was exactly 17 days for my refinance and other brokers I was working with said it couldn't be done in under 21 days. They were wrong and the faster dude won my business.

My original loan was with Rocket and then was sold off to some crap company. I was so sad to leave Rocket.

I'm bullish on both. They're both fantastic companies with different value adds. UWMC for a fast streamlined process for mortgages, Rocket for a fantastic platform and user experience with tons of diversification. I'm more bullish on RKT for the long long term, but you can't go wrong with either.",17,0,1614834063,ThisIsTechToday
