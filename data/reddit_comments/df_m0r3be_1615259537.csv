The distribution of wealth was a response that should have been recognized by the Trump admin and maybe was. He‚Äôs he wrong person to go to and put a tax where needed. You could have easily had a ‚ÄúCOVID GAINS‚Äù tax that may have helped pay for PPE and stimulus.

I don‚Äôt think addresses the virus was a mistake at all. It actually wasn‚Äôt strong enough. We could have shut everything down completely a little longer and probably would have been better.

This wasn‚Äôt like NIO or PLTR or TSLA or other speculative plays where retail investors know the risks they were getting into. Take profits from that all you want. We all knew the risks. 

The last week of January with GME turned into a fucking Children‚Äôs Crusade. People had no fucking clue what they were doing and I‚Äôll say a lot of them shouldn‚Äôt have been betting more than they could afford to lose on GME. But they did anyway. 

No matter what happened a lot of early buyers and myself had to go down with that ship. Apparently it wasn‚Äôt enough but we‚Äôre having our day now.

37,gqao1oz,"The media attention to GME when it was only like 30 billion in late January (not much compared to a lot of IPOs) alerted me to the blood in the water. Jen fucking Psaki was asked if old Joe Biden was aware of the situation in her daily press conference QA. I was thinking to myself who gives a shit, GME is tiny, before I realized the implications of this fear ‚Äî that GME was going to explode.

A 700 billion market cap is crazy but not entirely unreasonable. I like to shake my head and laugh at Tesla but it‚Äôs a case study for how irrational the market can be if it wants to. This could be like Tesla/Tulipmania meets MOASS. GME can be a perfect storm of separate 10 year black swan events working in tandem to push the price beyond reason. 10k is a crazy price insofaras some prime brokers for the shorts might go insolvent.
