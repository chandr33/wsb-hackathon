16,gpoag6w,"You think the MM are tired of being dragged into GME to hedge against their contracts?

Does the sweep itself indicate the direction *they* think it might go?

Feel free to not answer, I'm off to duckduckgo anyway. Thanks for putting it so concisely either way, I mused something similar in a thread the other day but it was like pissing into the wind.",3,0,1614878957,Vertical_Monkey

19,gpofjpj,whether or not that 40mil was a result of opening or closing a position is anybody's guess. It also could have been bought as a hedge against a short position. No idea. When you look at all the trades made it kinda creates a speculative narrative. I can only guess what that narrative looks like as a retail trader. IMO MMs across the board want GME to trade within that very specific price range of $80 to $130 and they're coordinating that effort.,2,0,1614881126,GoJa_official
