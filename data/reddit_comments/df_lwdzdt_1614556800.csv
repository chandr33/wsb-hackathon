6,gpgu1sp,"You are buying leap puts on QQQ as in betting that NASDAQ will be going down over the course of the year?

You understand that companies are trying to make money and everyone involves in them is working towards increasing the value, which means that in most cases, you are likely to see values rise, not fall?

There are times for puts, but leap puts on QQQ?",9,0,1614723846,ElegantEntropy

30,gpj7ld0,"I still think RBLX is a truly unique company that will do well in the long run. However, considering the fact that tech stocks are now in decline as investors rotate to more ""value"" and reopening plays I do not really see this company as something that will soar on DPO day. In addition, most of its record 96% gains in revenue was due to the pandemic lockdown and right now the narrative is on reopening so I don't see this growth as sustainable. 
That being said, I probably will not buy in now on IPO day, rather wait until things settle down with the general tech sector before dipping in.",2,0,1614779729,GushingGranny1
