61,gpoflj2,"The more I‚Äôve looked into ASO the last week, the more bullish on I‚Äôve become.

For those that aren‚Äôt aware, Academy sells way more than just guns, although they do sell quite a bit of those. January saw some of the highest demands for guns in recent history, as well as ammo shortages. But with COVID restrictions being lifted in the next few months, people are going to be eager to get out of the house. Combine this with warmer weather and another incoming stimulus check, you‚Äôd have to think demand for fishing, camping and other outdoor equipment will likely increase.

They sell fitness apparel, and when gyms open nationwide people will rush back to try to lose the weight they put on during quarantine. Baseball season starting up, people going out golfing. All sorts of different catalysts for this to take off.

The short interest and low float helps, but even ignoring that I think it‚Äôs a great reopening play. I‚Äôm not expecting this to jump overnight, but the 7/16 30Cs are enticing.

Current positions are shares at 25.60. Looking to add more shares if it drops as well as buy calls.",10,0,1614881147,hairyhairyveryscary

73,gponimd,"True, but events right now are transient in nature and I don't think there's going to be any recognizable share price or valuation change based on firearms as a result. Otherwise we'd see gun retailers yoyoing every eight years (or four) whenever the pendulum swings back to the left. If that were the case, we'd have a clear enough pattern that it would be a known thing. Buying the guns themselves is a much better investment. I turned a $599 S&amp;W AR into $1,700 last September.   


I mean, granted, you can still get screwed there.

Got it home and started deep-cleaning it, got about halfway through and started working on making an ergonomic grip for it. The next day I went back to cleaning up the finish and realized there was a hairline structural crack in the frame opposite the back end of the crane pivot.
