The gnarled, old man raised an eyebrow without tearing his gaze from the water. 

""When they near the end, they become panicked. Sometimes you have to let them run a little,"" he explained. ""Give them that taste of freedom. It's enough to boost their spirits, think they've won. When the line slackens, it feels like they've broken free. They'll even come toward the boat a little before they dive.""
