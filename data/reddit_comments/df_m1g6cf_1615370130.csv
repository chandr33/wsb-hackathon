21,gqfik9f,"If you place a stop loss they'll likely find it when the ride gets bumpy (I expect it will around 500) last time around it had 50% intraday swings. To be fair the ramp up has been slower and smoother so maybe a 50% stop loss could work.

25,gqfiki1,"I sold at $346 avg after suits raped the market. If not for the market rape on The Thursday we would get to $1000/share on that first run, and I am absolutely sure of it. With over 1k shares sold for around $1M in total, I'd retire. I don't need much.

Anyway after it all settled I stupidly thought $40 was still a bit too high, was in sort of depression after CCIV dumped so hard (still made gain, but not big enough as I could if it wasn't for pure greed and stupidity, PROFIT IS PROFIT FFS ! remember folks) and missed DFV post where he bought another 50k shares, and thought it will dip again after it went back to $90... 

Well I have symbolic 10@160.32 this time holding it till $10k per share or wherever it ends. And am sucker watching it go up and up and up... We regret missed opportunities the most, but I guess that's how one learns the life.",1,0,1615370170,wolfiasty
