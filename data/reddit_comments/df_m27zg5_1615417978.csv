3,gqi8mkf,"I think you're grossly overestimating how many people are interested in gamestop. Retail has never been a factor for price movement in any stock ever because our collectively buying power is no match for that of market-makers. That fact alone should make it clear.  

Let's use myself for example. I have 70 shares, sure. But go through the megathread and look at everyone saying they only have 18 shares, maybe not even a single share, some less than 10, very very few more than 100.   

There may be 1 million individuals in GME but I would say they each own 10 shares on average with the occasional retail-whale like DFV",2,0,1615417983,Tigerman456

20,gqi8nsp,I am no expert either have been value investing for some time but only swing trading as of late (pandemic got me chained to a desk for work with lots of free time so well before GME craze). And the more you watch the more you notice the markets moving in sync. Over 60% of trading in the us is done by algorithms. Most hedge funds aren’t “investing for the long term” their manipulating the market every step of the way. Why settle for ~10%/year returns when you can easily manipulate a few percent everyday with heavy algorithm based buying/selling. Would they shy away from GME absolutely not... 20-50% daily fluctuations of stock price is a swing traders wet dream. Yes their are lots of diamond hand apes but theirs more $ playing the game and taking their piece every step of the way.,3,0,1615417999,FITnLIT7
