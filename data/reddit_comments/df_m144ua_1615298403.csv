75,gqbt4p9,"Here‚Äôs the email I got from Seeking Alpha:

BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) has teamed up with Desay SV Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving.
Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery's Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.
BlackBerry QNX has a broad portfolio of embedded software, including safety-certified versions of its operating system, hypervisor, development tools and middleware for critical systems in automotive and beyond.
Automakers and Tier 1's use BlackBerry QNX software in their advanced driver assistance, handsfree and infotainment systems, along with their digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules.
BlackBerry's pedigree in safety, security, and continued innovation has led to its QNX technology being embedded in more than 175M vehicles on the road today.
BB stock has been volatile over the past few weeks after being caught up in recent Reddit/WallStreetBets driven short-squeeze mania. The stock is down almost 29% over the past month after rising 112.8% in January according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
BlackBerry faces significant competition from Google's Android and the open-source Linux in the automobile OS space, says Value Kicker in a SA article, ""BlackBerry: A Contender In IoT Facing Stiff Competition""
