70,gqgiiyf,"Guys - the $300 sell was is because of the $150 sell wall we had. Basically, a lot of people got in at $75 when it got stuck, and tried to double - thus wall at 150.

Then a lot of people got in at 150, and now people are trying to double again... thus wall at $300. 

If y'all do *not* remove your sell limits from $300, it'll be stuck here for a few days, and if we do blow past it, we'll get stuck *again* at $600. 

(Same goes for 420-lulz sells vs the rippled $800 sell wall).
