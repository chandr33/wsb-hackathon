3,gq6a59z,UTZ is the most underrated chip play right now. With chips needed everywhere the demand for UTZ is going to be insane. Hands down best chip maker out there,1,0,1615174808,Im-a-waffle

10,gq6b5xj,"At a quick glance I would say no, at least not a $30 call on the 19th. Seems like a better long play with closer to $20 just from scanning a few recent articles and looking at their growth.

13,gq6b8m9,"I'm in with shares. Pays a solid dividend. East coast chip maker, huge here in NY. Great products. Been around for 100yrs. This is a bit of a boomer type stock to be honest. I will buy some csp tomorrow as i don't mind owning if it goes lower now it dropped out the t.l.  I can't see it breaking out that hard. If you go look at the daily chart, it's fallen out the channel. I would maybe look for it to re-enter and test the trend for confirmation before entering the trade. Wondering how much you are looking to enter with the options trade? 12 days away is a bit too much risk imo. Why not go out 60+ days and buy a couple contracts at 25? That way you're closer to the SP and have a better chance of assignment. Or just own shares? Good luck though man.",1,0,1615175443,pmuk88
