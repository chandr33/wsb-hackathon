1,gpmpj1y,Money is literally just paper we give value at the end of the day. You need it to live comfortably but you shouldn‚Äôt let it take over your life. No matter who you are someone in your life cares about you and loves you. If you‚Äôre battling those thought just tell yourself its the depression talking and not you. If you are a true die hard investor through and through the losses should only be motivation to make those tendies back.   Everyone take it easy and don‚Äôt let some numbers on a cellphone be the thing that takes your life.,89,0,1614842867,Psychoknights

23,gpmrny4,"Its actually a rather alarming sign in general - the culture that is growing around us I mean. The hyper interest in money and profits - is really one of those mislead indicators of prosperity.

Back in the 60s/70s when alot of interviewers polled children what they wanted to become when they grew up. The answer used to be pretty standard: Fireman, doctor, police etc.

Now - the generations since around the 90s are answering this question more and more: ‚ÄùI want to become rich‚Äù

No skills attached, no real pursuit in a longer goal. 

And also - alot of people hype not working as a form of acheivment.

The problem Here is that we are social beings and work is one of those socializing habits we human beings have in society.

Work is not just about money - its also Well being, being part of society. Attributing to something bigger in life.

By this perspective this New generation combined with the stock market is about to explode.

I really hope somehow that this lift in wealth Will lower the hype around money for many. There is really a limit to how much a person needs. Above this limit, money is literary just money.

And if you define yourself in accordance to how much money you have? Whats going to happen to your self image once the money is gone?

With that Said - I fucking love stocks - and you should too.",42,0,1614844773,natasevres

47,gpmvtwi,"I work in the field I wanted to work in. I got the degrees necessary to work in it.

I cannot save enough money to buy a house. I can't save enough money to have children. I am so tired, and I look around and see nothing but other tired people as far as the eye can see. One trip to the doctor's office ending with bad news could leave me struggling with debt. There is no sense of security. Every day I wake up it feels like I'm battling something omnipresent that will get me in the end no matter what I do.

So I'm trying to make some money here, for myself and also to donate to charity. But fuck us, right? We're endangering the system by doing what we're told is the underpinning of capitalism. I am literally autistic (kind of redundant really), and I've been getting messages of ""Be yourself! Oh, no, not like that"" my whole life. Over time I've realized those messages are extremely revealing. They tell me when I've unintentionally hit upon a dangerous contradiction that could cause problems for everyone else if they had to think about it the way I do. 

""Invest- but not like that"" has me concerned that cheap loans given to already indebted businesses *before* the pandemic (and sold to investors) has us sitting at the precipice of something even worse than what we experienced in 2008. I live in one of the fastest growing counties in the U.S. and my landlord just renegotiated my lease to drop my rent. If there's not sufficient housing demand to justify my previous rent cost even in a booming region, how bad is it going to be for the commercial property development industry, which is staring down the barrel of people starting to like working from home?

It's not our behavior that's the problem, any more than it was the idea to insert control rods to stabilize a reactor experiencing a rapid increase in power that caused the Chernobyl explosion. The problem as always is unnecessary risk-taking by those in power coupled with design flaws no one wants to see.",38,1,1614848718,Cheshire_Cheese_Cat

50,gpmwfnr,"I saw some pretty troubling comments during the first big GME run up. One comment from a single mom really stuck with me.

I DM‚Äôd her and tried to tell her how to set up a trailing stop-loss order, but I never heard back.

There are people here playing with life changing amounts of money and that is fine if you can afford to lose it all. But so many people jumped in recently and risked far more than they should have.

Life and the world is a chaotic neutral. Nobody knows what the meaning is or anything, we all just give it our own meaning and take our own lessons as we go through. In the scheme of the universe individually we're not even blips. Nobody will remember us 100 years after we're gone. It sounds depressing but it's the complete opposite, it's liberating. It's the reason to get out of that relationship that makes you feel miserable. Go do that thing that makes you happy but might make others think you're a weirdo. We only get one guaranteed run at this life thing so f**k anybody saying how you should spend it

55,gpmwspo,"Citadel is in the dumb money acquisition phase. The 3-cup ball swindle has 3 pieces. 1: make the mark feel like a genius by letting him win and playing dumb. 2: Wait till they collectively surge and push in their nest eggs and replicate their exuberence, then 3: stop them out by retesting a panic sell 180. It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit. The first hit is free, the high will be like your first attempt at heroin, you will be superman, it's the next 100 that will ruin you.",3,0,1614849673,streetcleanermed
