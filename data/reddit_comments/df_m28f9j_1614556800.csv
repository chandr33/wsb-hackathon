1,gqhs52p,They didn’t get to buy back at 178 the price immediately jumped back above 250.  Im not sure what you are saying is even possible due to time constraints.,5,0,1615410387,Strutbuster_MS

4,gqhsxj7,Give him a break he did the math with crayons. It was a little messy.,21,0,1615410739,mfbawse
5,gqhtke6,"Plus they can't short the stock to drop it, and then buy back the same number of shares without the price returning to where it was. Unless a metric shit ton of other people sold their shares from fear",10,0,1615411019,Ctowncreek
6,gqhtwk1,More people bought on the dip than sold on the dip too,10,0,1615411168,Damp-Syrup
7,gqhtyp2,"That's their plan, scare you into selling on drops, then buy in at lower than they dropped it.",7,0,1615411195,woods4me
8,gqhucvo,"Worst case? They bought shares throughout the morning, waited for retail to push it up a little more and then dumped it all for some tendies",2,0,1615411365,Ctowncreek
9,gqhuu67,It’s clearly not working well. That drop was unlike anything I’ve ever seen: from 40% green to -20% in minutes. Then in only about 10 minutes it rocketed back 30%. People or institutions are buying the dips.,7,0,1615411576,Crizzlebizz
10,gqhv5e0,"Hard to outrun these guys, they trade quickly, have bots, watch the order book and probably are on the phone with their evil collaborators.

Best thing we can do is simply hold. If we can close the week over 400 it's game on when they need to cover.",4,0,1615411713,woods4me

12,gqhx432,They can trigger stop losses and pick those up.,1,0,1615412564,FlewFloo
13,gqhzm3b,"They did the same thing 1/25, 1/27, and 1/28. The only reason why it finally worked for them 1/28 is because every broker except Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard removed the fucking buy button for GME. Hold, and BTFD, and they lose. There's no way they turn off the buy button again with congress and the SEC already investigating.",7,0,1615413670,meta-cognizant
14,gqi22ma,"What people don’t understand, is that if a large number of shares are sold at market value (like today), if they started at $350, they probably weren’t done executing their order until under $200. If it is shorts attacking, then they didn’t not profit 172. Probably much less.",1,0,1615414806,MolassesLate4676
15,gqi3n4e,"If my charts are correct only 200,00 shares (max) were bought on the $172 1 minute candle, it only crossed 1 mil shares at an average of $230 a share. So one would like to imagine they made less than this",1,0,1615415546,Judders_Luigi
16,gqi5ooj,they didn't sell 1.48 mill shares at the top. They blasted the top with 1.48 mill shares. That means they just straight up filled all the buy orders from 350 all the way down to 178. half of those are already deep in the red(probably way more because the majority of the push back buy orders were way closer to 200 than 300). Plus they have to pay a fee on every single one of those shares. That is a massive loss for them.,1,0,1615416533,jaxpied
