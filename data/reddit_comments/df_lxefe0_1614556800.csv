14,gpmmljr,It's becoming obvious that GME IS the liquidity sponge that is normally reserved for blue chips at low prices in these markets. Cathy is going heavy on TSLA and PLTR because they are meme stocks and just bounce right back from anything. GME is THE meme stock.,16,0,1614840384,No_Instruction5780

If the pattern continues today, then I wouldn't be surprised with a 10%+ drop by 09:45 as ATH and open have been moving in opposite directions for the most part since 29th Jan.
