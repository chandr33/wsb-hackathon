2,gph9neb,Oh really? I thought a yolo is just a significant sizable play relative to your portfolio. Didn‚Äôt know it was literally yolo‚Äôing your entire portfolio on one ticker!,12,0,1614731647,heyzeuzz

13,gphay7w,"I‚Äôve sold every position except GME and today I spent it all on CLF.  Steel prices are through the roof.  Clf just became the largest manufacturer of steel.  They are now four times the company they were this time last year but the stock is the same price it was last year.   Their CEO hates hedge funds and has some tasty quotes telling them to fuck off.   There is much more but it closed at 14.68 today.  It‚Äôs worth 40.  Don‚Äôt listen to me though.  I can‚Äôt give financial advice as I‚Äôm paid to play with fire.
