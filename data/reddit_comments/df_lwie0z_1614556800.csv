2,gphjn83,You are going to mess up your kids account. Pick the age based option and leave it alone. You don’t have the time an skill set to do it correctly...and your kid NEEDS the money for school no a YOLO on a shit stock.,3,0,1614736814,Almost_average80

9,gphk617,"Doing it yourself works depending on the rate of return required to offset the tax hit. Personally, I a la carte (pick and build my own portfolio) all my investing and trading because of experience  and control. I like to make the all my decisions even at the cost of the taxation.",2,0,1614737084,OrangeAnaranjada
10,gphkkmg,Lmao. We're talking about 529s in here now.,1,0,1614737297,sdevil713
11,gphkl84,"Imo a 529 plan is better, I've put in about 30k the account balance is over 80k in 16+ years so 50k without ltcg. Maryland uses TRowe price funds which I find exceptional. Could I have done better, maybe. Could I have done worse,  probably. TRowe has great funds and throw in no capital gains tax and it was a no brainer for me. Dollar cost averaging out of my brokerage account into the 529, plus since I live in Maryland I got to take the contributions off my state taxes, saving me another 6.25%",2,0,1614737306,Fun_Trader101
12,gphkn4w,"This is where im at. Im kinda anal when i invest and make sure to do my DD. I feel like going with my above calculation would be the best long term minor risk. 

When i say stocks im not gonna add like $5000 to a risky stock. Be something like apple or google, paypal/ square. Or something with consistent growth for most of it and then a few higher risk too for potential of return. But for them i like the idea of watching it grow in mostly ETFs",1,0,1614737334,DaddyDersch

15,gphlxbs,"I just opened two 529 through TD. They have age group diversified funds that will become safer as the kids get older. I also did it because they can be used for tuition for K-12 at private schools as well. I figured i was going to have to spend the money anyway, i might as well get the tax break. I also figured it would be better to have the trust set up somewhere where i wouldn't be looking at it every second of the day (less chance of me getting scared on a dip and making an emotional decision).  i figure 15 years of letting it grow will end up being better than anything i can do on my own. On the other hand you can bet it all on RKT and GME, but i think you probably care about your kids future, otherwise you wouldn't be talking about 529's on WSBs lol. Good luck and hope i could help.",2,0,1614737986,booshpladsupreme
16,gphmszz,"Haha despise some of the other shade i got i do appreciate it and i asked it here cause even tho we got some ree ree's here also some strong advice too. 

The 529 does have advantages. That helps. Thank you. 

Haha bet all their college funds on gme. Either be the smartest dad ever or the dumbest 🤣🤣",1,0,1614738440,DaddyDersch
