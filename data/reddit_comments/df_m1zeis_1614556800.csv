15,gqgcsai,"Pretty much everything right now is theoretical what I'm about to tell you, but I've been compiling information from various DDs over recent weeks, please do your own DD. 

1. One which struck me the most was how Hedges were making money in the current market. It was suggested that Hedges were artificially driving up the price and selling off shares at its peak, this can be done by hedges selling stocks between them at a designated price, driving up demand, then driving up the stock value, thus profiting. Then waiting for the price to dip off in order to come back in. The market never closed on its upper price, that was until yesterday.

2. Based on above information I feel that the strategy of Hedges driving up the price has now become redundant. There are very many catalysts at play, but I feel like there is a great deal of FOMO going on (Fear of missing out). Especially from those who paper handed (sold early) in the January squeeze(?).

3. People are getting cash injections through many different methods in order to make a quick buck and taking an opportunity that they don't want to pass up.

4. Day traders are having an absolute fucking field day with GME right now. They will sell on small margins and buy back on every slight down tick. That's likely why you see alot of fluctuations in up and down ticks, but the trend is most certainly up.",3,0,1615389917,ChudBomB

18,gqgdnrf,"Prob some hedge fund figured if they moved the price up, a bunch of retail investors would pile in again and they could then unload their shares. All these people saying they are never selling are going to be bag holding when that happens. It's amazing what you can do with a few billion dollars and a generation of people who invest in bankrupt companies based on memes.",-1,0,1615390308,d00ns

26,gqggcjt,"Infinite money glitch. At the end of each month the price drops from whatever dirty tricks they are using. Then rides back up again as the next month starts. Rinse repeat.

Just go back and check. Have your mind blown by how it's a repetitive pattern currently. And then buy the dip and sell every 50% gains. Rinse repeat.

28,gqggtlv,I guess what I'm wondering is what makes you think it'll end eventually? When the hedges run out of money to throw at shorts? I feel like they'll stay in the game as long as they can.,1,0,1615391653,Brokestudentpmcash

31,gqghl2j,"I fully believe all the institutions will go bankrupt before folding to the common retard. It's human nature.

After it'll be a cascade of bankruptcy's as hedgies fail, MM fail, insurance fail, and so on until the bill lands on the governments footsteps. And if you payed attention to American bailouts. These money makers have nothing to worry about.

But for us none of that will matter. Once the hedgies go under the stock will sky rocket cause no one is left manipulating the market. We all cash out at some point. Good and bad. We're in a win/win situation currently.

Edit: I'll note. Time is now our friend. We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent...",2,0,1615391956,Critical_Lurker
