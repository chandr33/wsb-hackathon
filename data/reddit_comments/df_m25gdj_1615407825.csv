1. They consolidated their currencies in order to leverage more sales.

70,gqjthmu,"agreed.

at $70, this direct listing raked in like 14 billion, adding on top of their previous market cap of their listing mcap of 30 billion. also, they have been operating in the red.

don't get me wrong... I would definitely invest, but not at these price levels. they have already surpassed (in terms of mcap) of $znga by 4x, epic by 2.5x, and sits around 50% of $atvi (activision/blizzard) (someone please step in and correct me if my valuation math is wrong).

if this dips to $25-35, it would definitely pique my interest (since they seem to have a monopoly, for the time being, on the tween/teen market).",1,0,1615450609,uglymittens
