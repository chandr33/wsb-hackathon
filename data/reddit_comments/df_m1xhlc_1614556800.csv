16,gqfyr7v,"🚀🚀🚀Good Morning Everyone!🚀🚀🚀

[Here's the link to yesterday's comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16emz/gme_megathread_for_march_09_2021/gqd7afb/) I will edit this comment with my thoughts on GME throughout the day. 

Please forgive me about the confusion yesterday. My last comment got deleted without an explanation. I did not delete my comments. This caused a lot of panic for those following along. Mods, if there is anything I am doing wrong, please let me know so I can correct and prevent another take down.

For Corporate America, I offer you this DD.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that 🚀🚀🚀.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the American Apes were sleeping, the European Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74",1,0,1615383031,Corno4825
