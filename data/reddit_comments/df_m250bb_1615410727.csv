5,gqhsz05,"On one hand, I don't like equating selling as to a lack of conviction or balls, since trading should be rationale and emotionless.

However, I cannot fathom people who bought at 300 and sold at 80. You lost the money, just hold on to it, the lowest it can go is $7, and if it hasn't reached that then there's still some hope.

If you were able to be without the money from 300 to 80, then you will still be fine, just hold on to those shares cause you never know.

Never bet what you cant afford to lose.

Imagine thinking you could force retail to abandon ship with a coordinated short attack midday that doesn't even move the vwap and have news articles that post immediately that don't even make sense because the stock had a near net zero day.

Guh how freaking stupid would you have to be to do that. Imagine how stupid a person would have to be to pull that when they are so deep in the hole they are basically a walking dead man. 

I guess when bears get cornered they lash out and they can hibernate for extended periods of time constipated with debt. Lol I understand the bear position so much more everyday.

I didn't print up a bunch of fake shares, buy them at a huge value discount, and then sell those fake shares on the open market over and over: I supported a company the only way a retail investor is ""allowed"" to. 

The reason I'm being very explicit about this is because we are in uncharted territory. The fact is, I played the game the only way I'm allowed to per the rules. Rules that we, as retail investors , should be certain are applied to everyone in the game. If the media is being fed a ""retail investors fucked us over"" story line, how long will it be until a journalist wonders how that could even be possible? Because the fact is: It's not.
