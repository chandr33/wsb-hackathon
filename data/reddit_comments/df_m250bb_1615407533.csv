3,gqhll45,"So how could retail investors ever be the ""baddies?"" 

I have 8 shares. As a retail investor, I hold the reasonable expectation that when I purchase shares of a company I like they are ACTUAL shares. Not shorted, imaginary, or otherwise synthetic shares. I am holding REAL shares, or I should be because that is what I purchased: 8 of 69-whatever million issued shares. If retail investors can't be assured that they hold issued shares of actual value, then the entire market is a charade.

Any problems trying to find ""real"" shares to cover positions made with imaginary shares aren't MY problems. As a matter of fact, as a retail investor holding real shares, I'm a good guy! I can help in the search for real shares needed to cover! 

They can have these valuable shares at a fair price that takes their authenticity and rarity into account.",58,0,1615407601,lady-ish

When the article was updated (as the title shows) that metadata isn't updated because it's the same URL. The actual article contents aren't cached, so the updated article is still pulled.


Can you find a copy of that marketwatch article that wasn't screenshotted through a 3rd party reader? This is like using RH to read an article and assuming that RH's timestamp is more accurate than the MarketWatch ones.

Because as it is now, that's a screenshot of a reader app not recognizing that an article is different but the endpoint is the same. That's not MarketWatch's own timestamp.
