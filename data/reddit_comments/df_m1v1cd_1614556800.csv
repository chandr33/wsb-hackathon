On one side i want to buy multiples of 8 shares of GE at its lowest price and then have it split and grow. 

On the other I just can not bring myself to buy into this message from their management where they are trying to even the playing field with their competitors by bringing their float down. If they would have orchestrated a buyback program, that would be the best positive message they could send but this just shows that they are cash starved and need to take drastic steps just to look better as compared to their competition. 

As a person who started his career with GE this is a moment where premonition meets reality. I knew when i stepped out back in 2014 that they were not going in the right direction. Are they course correcting yet? Not quite sure. These people used outsourcing for wrong reasons and used the cost advantage that outsourcing brings to hide their other bad decision making.
