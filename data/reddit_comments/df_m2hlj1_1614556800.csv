The longs just let the short attack go. It exposed the short-side. Forced their hand.

The fact GME bounced like it did proves is resilience while exposing the short-side manipulation.

TLDR: Shorts gunna get a spanking",48,1,1615436575,itspalpatime

16,gqjeagn,Agreed. They thought 350 was enough for apes. I was holding all the way down to 40. I now have a even thicker skin. They forget that apes can grow a wrinkle.,5,0,1615441029,Retard_2028

19,gqjfvt3,"I bought 120 $GME @ 212 in Jan. A few weeks ago I sold a 3/12 C 225 to buy $PLTR calls. Then this week it goes ITM and I‚Äôm trying to decide if I chance it‚Äôll be exercised and I lose 100 $GME  at 225, or if I buy the C back even though it‚Äôll cost a lot more than I sold for. After yesterday, I decided I needed to buy it back to save my shares, and just sell other assets or maybe 20 $GME to cover the cost. It goes boom today, probably sitting around 330, and I pulled the trigger and bought the C back for $108. Not 10 minutes later the stock drops, and now I‚Äôm 10K+ in the hole (gonna get margined called on that), and I need $GME at 287 to break even. But I‚Äôm holding as much as possible and will figure out how to pay that 10K with my other positions and maybe a few $GME if necessary. üíéü§≤üèº to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ",2,0,1615441926,_RayDiggs_
