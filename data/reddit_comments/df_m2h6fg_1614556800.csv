13,gqj4s16,"They doubled their revenue from 2019 to 2020 and tripled their loss losing 273m on just short of $1b revenue. The market valuation is $45b. That‚Äôs ridiculous. It would have to get like 7 times larger and profitable to be worth its current price. That‚Äôs not investing. You invest in things that will grow and grow the valuation not something already fully valued after the growth story.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think the platform is good in the long term, but it‚Äôs valuation was at $45. What makes it worth getting in at $70?

35,gqj6o3z,Most companies do at this point but the question is will they have staying power and last until they can live up to their valuation. It‚Äôs a risk. They could make a go of it and deliver but $45b is 30x forward revenue. Seems pricey. Games can be very fickle. The platform concept is interesting compared to others. The number of low age users tho will limit the revenue potential. It‚Äôs the 12-30 crowd that spends the most on games. Not the 5-12 crowd. Just my .02. But the market is irrational at the moment so hey probably $100 tomorrow.,2,0,1615436371,TheFan88

They love they can build their own shit for the game whether it's a puzzle or a whole map, a house or even clothes. I like it because it's cheap in regards to the subscription or buying Robux on their own. 

Both used to play fortnite but not any more and certainly don't buy stuff on there. Many of their friends don't play fortnite anymore either. This means Fortnite needs to be reinvented again.... which is hard as they just do stupid add ons or special packs but it's it's same shit... or they die a slow death, which I believe is what will happen.
