4,gqe7qgq,"CPA turd here.  I just pop the summaries on the 1099 into the return (short/long term, basis reported / not reported, etc) and then attach the 1099-B to the return when I file.  Let them at the IRS and the states figure it out.

Trust me when I tell you the broker literally does all the work for you.",11,0,1615337368,CledusBeefpile

8,gqeba5p,"Sure, technically you should go through all those trades and make sure the summary is right and they didn't miscategorize something or whatever, but who has time for that?

Also, you need a new accountant if you're doing his job for him.",6,0,1615339267,Rrrrandle

13,gqeebqi,"New in 2021 is amending by efile.  Some states still require an amended return to be mailed (looking at you, Nebraska).

I efile and attach a pdf of the 1099 to the return.  This capability is built into the efile API.  I work for a professional services firm where we pay for this shit.",1,0,1615340888,CledusBeefpile
14,gqeesz1,"This is correct. I use TurboTax, BUT my 1099 from my brokerage was not importable. TurboTax asks me if I have a bunch of lines, if so, just manually put in the summary. No need to put in each trade data.",2,0,1615341142,ihavequestions987
15,gqeetek,"This is the way - you only need to enter the summary of proceeds, gains and losses portion of the 1099-B info into your return (as opposed to entering each individual transaction).",2,0,1615341149,BasedMagicFan

20,gqexfpq,"Just as a general heads up, RobinHood has issued some amended 1099s in past years, roughly one month after the original 1099 comes out. This year, that would be around March 16. I am waiting until after then to file in case the amended form comes out so I don't have to amend. If you haven't filed yet, I'd recommend you do the same.",1,0,1615351923,DollarThrill

22,gqf8kt1,"I know this was likely thrown together quickly, but I'm retarded so I'm going to review it.

1. Not PEP8 compliant.  Refactor the logic with nested conditions as functions
2. Put the working code into a function so you don't execute the code if another python file imports your file
3. I'd recommend passing the file path as a command line argument instead of raw input from the executing code (at the very least so it can be tab-completed)
4. Your index variable 'i' is impossible to keep track of

Great job with commenting though.",1,0,1615360656,gimme_GME
