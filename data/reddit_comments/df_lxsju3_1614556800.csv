9,gpp1lbn,i thought so too!,1,0,1614890318,Mikeinthemornin
10,gpp5215,They could have used that cash to expand instead of share repurchasing. This seems like a shitty move imo,1,0,1614891755,throwaway__3012
11,gpp5u8p,They still plan to open roughly 20 more stores in 2021 so idk lol slow growth,1,0,1614892087,Mikeinthemornin
12,gpp6num,It’s just spending 300m on share repurchases doesn’t make sense when you’re trying to grow. It seems like management wants to just cash out on their stock options when they could be using that money to open up new stores and grow the company,3,0,1614892437,throwaway__3012
13,gpp7855,Valid point for sure,2,0,1614892681,Mikeinthemornin
14,gpp8fgv,Ya it’s definitely an odd move. To me it signals they don’t have any better moves to make with their cash. if they are trying to expand this would be really concerning to me if I owned it. I looked at their balance sheet and I’m almost certain a big portion of this repurchase was debt financed which is concerning for growth also. This will end up considerably decreasing their free cash flows which you don’t want to do if you are trying to expand as a retailer,1,0,1614893205,throwaway__3012
15,gppuzhw,I thought good companies should buyback shares when they feel the price is undervalued. That's what Buffett always preached anyways. Maybe they see the company as undervalued and are taking advantage of that.,2,0,1614903982,Thulohot
16,gppvjqb,i always thought buy backs were a bullish indicator as well,2,0,1614904265,Mikeinthemornin
