29,gqf8zwp,"Good way to think about it. 20% chance of $1k is a good opportunity, especially if you believe there's a floor.  
  
There's a low chance that the squeeze squeezes and a handful of shares trade in the 6 figures, but it will get shutdown if that happens. You and I won't be able to cash out at that price. I don't know what mechanism will be used, but at that point it's in ""too big to fail"" territory and trading will just be stopped, trades will be reversed, whatever.  
  
The upper bound I see is the example from the VW squeeze where VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world on paper. GME passing AAPL would be around a $35k share price.  
  
But I'll keep holding the stock, because when I look at lists of companies with valuations of $40-60B, GME wouldn't seem out of place there, and $1k puts them at the top of that range. Squeeze is just on top of that.",1,0,1615361023,PM_ME_CRYPTOCURRENCY
