No debt, but also no real chance to ever making it so big that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about money.

Whats happening here will be life changing for so many and I‚Äôm just one of them.

I got in at 18, with not a lot because I don‚Äôt even have emergency fund. This was a gamble that I couldn‚Äôt even tell my other half because she would have been mad.

When this is said and done, this will secure my kids school fees and give them a childhood that I never had myself.

I‚Äôm not even talking ‚Äúif it hits 100k‚Äù shit. This has already multiplied my finances in ways I never dreamt of.
 If it keeps going, I can maybe even afford to fix that one tooth that has been hurting for 2 years without feeling that ‚Äúoh I should have spent money elsewhere‚Äù

I‚Äôm an ape, I have feelings. I will hold, because thats all I‚Äôve been doing since I got it at 18.

Proud to be part of this.
