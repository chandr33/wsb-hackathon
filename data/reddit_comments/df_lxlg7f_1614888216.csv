It dipped to the point of putting my 7.5 puts in the money but is now at 7.8 and I'm kinda glad about that because now that I know it's being propped up fairly weakly I can buy more at the ATM price and make that much more when it eventually drops to zero... CLOV is the ticker... I'd check it out if you're looking for a quick 40% return. Put options expiring in April were .85 so if ya got a few bucks...",-7,0,1614888715,KnoxHarringtonVideos
