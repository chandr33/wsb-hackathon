44,gqfvap5,"How is Roblox IPO not market manipulation? They‚Äôre opening up almost 30x P/E ratio and investors are going against fundamentals at this point - the valuation doesn‚Äôt make sense. By using their logic on GameStop. This move alone on hedge funds, banks, big corporate investors, etc defeats the argument on what they have been putting on retail investors, right?
