7,gphd9hr,The squeeze would happen because nearly 38M of the total 90M shares are borrowed short. Once the stock starts mooning they have to buy to cover and it just keeps squeezing. 40% short interest is insanely high. I think it could be time we all make a move,12,0,1614733509,StockAstro

23,gphe8b6,Awh nah....that‚Äôs a bad sign. Atleast RKT had a good catalyst to do what it did. I still don‚Äôt see any reason SKT will get the attention it needs for it to really moon.

54,gphibu8,"went from 4 to 16 during pandemic in retail land sector. impressive, but I can see why it's shorted so much - I cant see a reason in the world that this stock is worth more than 12 at best - even under recovery.  its above prepandemic lvls, and losing money.  opening is already preprinted in.  good luck on a squeeze, but I want some upside value if not squeezed, I am out, but thx for looking at it",1,0,1614736121,shitt4brains
55,gphic0w,"The reason is because high short interest doesn‚Äôt mean anything besides people are betting against it and are expecting it to go down. A heavily shorted stock does not mean it is a good stock. GME was special bc it was undervalued. Even then, that didn‚Äôt mean anything. What made GME was the catalysts. Ryan Cohen joining the board, bunch of chewy and AWS moving over, the nationwide attention, the CEO being forced out, etc. All of these things spell change for a company and showed that it really was undervalued. People started to trust and invest in the company (or join for memes or fomo) and it went up. Shorts had to cover which forced it up more. Shorts shorted more because they thought it was a blockbuster of video game stores and overvalued, people disagreed and bought and the stock went up. And this cycle repeated for a while. I know nothing about SKT, but they will need a catalyst or more than one to capitalize on shorts and start to moon. One final thing GME had going for it was the name. Everyone knew what a GameStop was, I have no clue what a Tanger Factory Outlets is... but based on the heavy short position, I‚Äôd say people don‚Äôt like it and expect it to go down. For that reason, I‚Äôm out.",6,0,1614736123,SuggestiveAmoeba5
