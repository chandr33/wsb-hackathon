26,gq9g2yx,"\&gt;Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

64,gq9lxm9,I've always wondered much they charge the HF for shorting. Its good to see that you've included that info. Can you make a calculation on how much money they have to pay interest daily on that 1.7% fee based on the stocks they have shorted so far? Cuz someone said that they made an AI that calculated the real SI and it was 400% or something. It can't be cheap to be paying that interest everyday and even the HF's don't have endless money. It seems wierd that they've managed for so long.,2,0,1615244356,Rapsy112
