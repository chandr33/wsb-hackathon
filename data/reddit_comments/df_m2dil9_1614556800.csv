This is just one cog in the wheel - the financial media sector...theres the political sectors, divide &amp; conquer, fear mongering....blah blah...just pay attention....when ppl get desensitized to one thing, they create a bigger thing to blow up and make bigger than it is, which in turn makes it HUGE and helps control the people to get what THEY WANT.

90,gqin9qf,"The 14 hours thing is wrong. That happens when outlets roll over URLs and screw around for the SEO. The Google index time doesn‚Äôt mean anything.

EDIT: Since the ‚Äúwebmaster‚Äù below is indulging in some motivated reasoning, let me explain this more clearly. I‚Äôm an editor with a media outlet, for reference. 

Most news stories you read are regularly updated as news develops. So a story about, for example, a terrorist attack published at 10 AM might include reporting on the capture of a suspect that happened at 2 PM. That doesn‚Äôt mean the news outlet has a crystal ball, it means they‚Äôve been actively updating the article. So some sort of article about GME existed 14 hours earlier, but the most likely explanation is that it was overhauled/updated into what‚Äôs at that URL now. 

But let‚Äôs assume otherwise. If there is a conspiracy, and the media is in on it, what possible benefit would there be to putting an article advertising an upcoming attack on the stock online 14 hours earlier? And with all the attention on GME, how come no one found the article over that 14 hour period? What‚Äôs more likely, that, or that a news article was updated and rewritten in a fashion that is common in the industry?

I don‚Äôt doubt hedge funds are pulling all kinds of shady shit here. But the URL cache thing is not a smoking gun.",28,1,1615425680,EthanCoxMTL
