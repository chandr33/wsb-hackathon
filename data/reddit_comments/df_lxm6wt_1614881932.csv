1,gpohq35,"Pretty much anywhere in the US outside of the more expensive cities. Buy a $500k house and you're still left with $4 million. At a 3% withdrawal rate that gives you $120k/year or $10k/month... and 3% is bulletproof, you can build a decently diversified portfolio of stocks with dividends averaging more than that. With your house already paid for that's PLENTY of money to live off, and you're taxed at the capital gains rate which is lower than ordinary income.",57,0,1614882037,xkulp8
