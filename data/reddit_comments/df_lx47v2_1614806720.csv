There are spikes on January 27th (when GME was at its height) where someone bought large amounts of shares for $SKT and $ASO. I'm seeing them being pumped up this week on here. 

Just be forewarned that whoever bought those shares is now trying to get you to hold the bag. It's probably Melvin Capital trying to get back at you all for GME. 

So want to fuck Melvin again? Never buy $SKT, $ASO or any other ticker on here that has suspicious spikes in previous trading and no due diligence posted.
