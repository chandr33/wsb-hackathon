Man.. I can't decide to buy immediately or wait for the inevitable sell off that will come shortly after, so I guess I'll do both. Seems like every direct listing has a buy period that shoots the value up for a few days, massive sell off while people take gainz, then it appreciates at a more normal rate.

My prediction is: Get listed, shoot up 30%, tank 45%, then rise back to listing price within a month.",4,0,1615330239,DothrakAndRoll
