4,gqf0i17,"So listen. I’m not autistic, but instead I’m a smooth brain social butterfly. I have 3 shares of GME and a geology degree I’m not using. I don’t have titan dreams; I just want stability and a cool boss. Once we’re on the moon next year, hit me up. I’d love to be your assistant; you’ll want one to navigate all the social BS that goes into being a TV personality.",1,0,1615354062,Station_CHII2

8,gqf546w,Bro I also have 3 shares and a geology degree I'm not using.............,1,0,1615357673,realbendstraw
9,gqf56oh,Weird! Where/whendid you do field camp?,1,0,1615357731,Station_CHII2
10,gqf68m1,"I'm sorry to breach your trust so quickly, but it's actually geochemistry and I didn't do all the classic geology stuff. Like field camp :/ 2015 degree though..... haven't applied for anything in the field in a while but the idea of packing up and taking a decent job out in Colorado sounds great.",1,0,1615358623,realbendstraw
11,gqf6imb,"No sweat!! All part of the same ☺️I took one GeoChem course and enjoyed it a lot... I could be misremembering, but we might have been doing a lot of crystal fractionation calculations? I took it alongside petrology, petrography, and Economic Geology, so the memories blur together. That was an intense semester!",1,0,1615358861,Station_CHII2
12,gqf8ucs,Haha hech yea those solid state solution triangle charts were the shit! Lots of isotopes and ratios and we kinda claim the radioactive stuff. The geology program at my school was pretty big and I wanted to differentiate myself with geophysics or geochem and the higher level math courses kinda scared me off physics. All good though bc the higher level chemistry stuff was fascinating. Analytical chemistry - learned how our science machines work... mind blowing.,1,0,1615360887,realbendstraw
