1,gpglfqm,I'm out. I learned with BB when I saw 2k go to 26k then back to 5k.  I took 1000% profit today and got out right before close.  Ill watch in horror tomorrow when it opens at $55,9,0,1614720002,anthony451000

3,gpgllxs,I just made a good buck of selling all my calls.  I've never done puts. Can you TLDR buying puts for a novice retard?,1,0,1614720074,Metasophocles

13,gpgmf0i,I sold my call option for a $1k gain today so happy it was my first one and u think it’s going down ? People saying it might hit $50 then after nobody knows,1,0,1614720421,XMachoManX12
14,gpgmfnh,I am curious on the comment about volume and maybe I don't understand what you are trying to explain. According to NASDAQ peak GME volume was as 197m on 1/26 I think it was. Today's volume for RKT was 359m.,1,0,1614720430,jlschwefel

16,gpgmoz3,"So if I buy a put at 20 strike price...that gives me the option to sell shares at $20 if the price is at $20 or lower?  If I have zero shares, I'm really just planning to resell the put as the stock price falls and put value increases?",1,0,1614720544,Metasophocles
17,gpgtyi5,I would love for it to hit $50. For me personally it was a good time to exit. I had made more money than I thought I would and my calls were expiring 3/12 so they were subject to high volatility and I just wanted to lock in my gains. I originally bought the puts as a hedge but they were so cheap I decided to keep them. For the sake of all my homies here I would be glad to see them expire worthless.,1,0,1614723802,ConditionNeither
