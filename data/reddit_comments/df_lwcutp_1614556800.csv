1,gpgmygm,I think HF are pushing it down. Someone commented on shorts of 390000 about an hour before close. Iâ€™m buying more if it drops closer to 10. I think there will be a small surge near the end of the month. Iâ€™ll  do the same with AMC if it drops back near 5.,5,0,1614720659,AtomicHawkeye
2,gpgnu5r,But why?  I can't understand why they want to short it so heavily.  The moves they've been making...QNX and IVY are going to be ubiquitous.  It'd be nice if the HF would get on board the rocket.  There's plenty of room on here!,6,0,1614721047,spacep0p3
3,gpgogd7,BB is being hold back for quite some time. Almost scary when it is going to explode. Fun part is: when it breaks free it is going to really fly !,18,0,1614721313,plaatsvervanger
4,gpgon1d,Itâ€™s all about money. They will short it. The stock will drop. Retail investors will sell. They will get out of their short positions. Buy back millions of shares slowly then buy a huge lot at the end of the month. FOMO retail investors will start buying while its climbing. HF sell off profits slowly. There was a video about this regarding the last surge of meme stocks with the SEC talking about GME end of February.,8,0,1614721394,AtomicHawkeye
5,gpgonns,End of the month and we will see where BB goes. Earnings and FB deal will be known,13,0,1614721401,MonkeyFarmer1

8,gpgqst9,"I have 140 $25 3/19 calls that are painfully down. I hope it gets some movement before then. I bought some when share price was $20, then bought a bunch more to average down, but still painful to see down about $5k lol.",6,0,1614722341,Nakamura9812
9,gpgrmm3,My understanding is that the judge pushed off some part of it to later in the year...(correct me if I'm wrong),1,0,1614722716,joshuki
10,gpgtkwg,"Damn that must be painful to watch. What's your average now ?

I fomo'd 80% of my portfolio into BB when it was lifting off then it tanked shortly after? At what price do you plan to sell ?",3,0,1614723624,Earthrise1

12,gpgw2wg,"Vanguard has the absolute worst UI/UX of any broker, so naturally they don't tell me my average cost, but by my math I'm at $13.99/share. 

When do I plan to what?  What's that last word mean?  Sell?  Is that like an exit strategy?  Because I've heard that word used around here a few times. Kidding, of course. My goal is to pull out my basis at $40, then ride it to either Uranus or the center of the Earth. I really do love the stock.",4,0,1614724818,spacep0p3

14,gpgwjqc,"Iâ€™ve got 100% of my portfolio in BB at $18 lmao. And since it has 100% margin requirement on TDA, I canâ€™t trade until BB recovers ðŸ˜­",3,0,1614725041,greaseballxwondo
15,gpgyoap,"If there's a short squeeze and the stock price briefly peaks and touches $13.99, would you be tempted to sell out everything and buy back in when it tanks to $10 again as it seems to love doing ? I'm just wondering if that's a good strategy?",1,0,1614726063,Earthrise1
16,gpgyqng,"I put all $30,000 of my one brokerage account into BB at $18 as well. It is a bad feeling for sure.",5,0,1614726096,Dramatic_Medicine_51
17,gph2w91,"I feel your pain, Iâ€™ve got 237 @ $22 but Monday I threw the last $300 in my account at 25 3/5 12c. I think itâ€™s undervalued at this point and primed for takeoff.",2,0,1614728185,ged923

32,gpi6fpa,"Expensive lesson. They have an investor conference call Thursday with someone at Morgan Stanley, plus the stimulus package should be passed in the next 10 days, yeah Iâ€™m grasping for straws, just trying to minimize the loss at this point.

42,gpl54o1,Thatâ€™s what I thought you meant and thatâ€™s what my plan is either Friday or Monday. See if tomorrowâ€™s investor conference moves the stock at all and sell on the trend up hopefully to minimize loss and buy further out ones.
