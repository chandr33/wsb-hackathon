The location is in Mexico, but it’s a UK company.  

Any ideas?",1,0,1615394087,Appropriate-Ad-1281

If you want really revolutionary, there are companies working on creating hemp based batteries that show even more promise.",1,0,1615394319,Haunting-Koala5149
9,gqgnngs,"Neolithium is a way better lithium play. Lithium demand will continue to increase and supply is constrained. There are huge differences in the cost of production between hard rock mines and lithium salt evap extraction. The company best poised for gains is neolithium based off current price/reserve ratio, cost of extraction of reserves, capitalization etc.",1,0,1615394330,AppealPuzzled6845
