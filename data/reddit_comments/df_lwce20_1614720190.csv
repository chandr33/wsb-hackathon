40,gpglztd,"Hi folks

have you heard of AMS? This is Apple's sensor manufacturer. There is a rumor that Apple may pull out of AMS. Apple never confirmed this rumor. AMS took over Osram last year, resulting in synergies that lead to large savings. AMS is also broadly diversified and also manufactures products other than sensors. The fourth quarter of 2020 significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The company now also wants to pay a dividend again. The stock is listed in Zurich, today's price was approximately USD 22.28. Two shorties, Sylebra Capital Limited and Systematica Investments Limited, have been increasing their short positions since the beginning of February. that's why the price is falling. Would be a very good investment for sure!",1,0,1614720238,Capable-Category-497
