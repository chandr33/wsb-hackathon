This is actual financial and general advice: Don't confuse the GME play with some political agenda, if you really want to, play this for the money, but go and goddamn vote. Bringing politics into this can only backfire, we've seen from the DFV hearing that congress would be eager to regulate payment for order flow and other market mechanisms, that ultimately would do fuck all to ""hurt hedgies"" and would only hurt the retail investor.
