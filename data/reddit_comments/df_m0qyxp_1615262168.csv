1,gqairzd,"At GME = $501, each option contract will be worth $100. Your cost is $488. You will make a loss.

You only start to profit at $505. 

IMHO, this is not a good bet.

On the other hand, at $1000, this will net you profit of $650k. So, good luck!",1,0,1615262279,taimoor2

6,gqajfvd,"This is a bag of shit. He won't make money this week because it is highly unlikely the option will go over $500. 

However, OP is hoping that someone else will think that GME will go above $500 THIS week. So, he can sell the bag of shit tomorrow and make money. The person who holds till friday is the bagholder.

This is where the term bagholder comes from. What OP is doing is retarded.",1,0,1615262670,taimoor2
