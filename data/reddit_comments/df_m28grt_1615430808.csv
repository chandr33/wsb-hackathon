The most idiotic thing to say considering it's always been a casino, they just don't want to admit it. It also works just like a casino since you can win, but people are there to fuck with you if you do.

For those who can read, Edward Thorpe, a man for all markets, literally beat actual casinos. 

I've played some incredibly broken games but boy, these guys really take the cake here. The whole machine is designed to push passive investing at all costs for IF we plebs ever touch stocks. It's fucking hilarious how up in arms they are about people using their own fucking money how they want. 

If we don't consume 100%+ of our income and play stocks, AND potentially win, the whole economy gets fucked up. That's why lol. They need the masses spending and we're closing in on their gold mine.
