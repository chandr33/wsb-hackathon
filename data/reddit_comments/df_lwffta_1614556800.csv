2/ the competition is much much greater than 2 making it consistently to orbit. Matter of fact, Rocket Lab is a relatively new player in the market. 

3/ Very promising company nonetheless, but remember what Daddy Elon said about taking SpaceX public, SpaceX's long term goals conflict with short-term pace of a publicly traded company.
