14,gpfo6tl,"1. Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of the company

This was proven to be false today through this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw37yp/rktthere\_has\_been\_some\_misinformation\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw37yp/rktthere_has_been_some_misinformation_being/)

2.   There is currently 113m shares outstanding of which MeetKevin's stream on youtube showed from his S3 terminal that the short interest increased to \~41% yesterday

This might be true but just because people are short a company doesn't mean you can squeeze it, GME was literally a once in a lifetime opportunity and you retards are chasing every single shorted company going ""omg squeeeeeze bro"". If you refer to the above post there are currently 55% of companies shorted more than RKT

3.  RKT recently announced a **1 billion dollar buyback** program. At the time of writing this, $RKT is sitting around $29 x 114m shares = 3.3B in float. **Buyback will reduce available float by 30%**

RKT is sitting up roughly 50 percent in a week so... priced in

4.  We have a catalyst event of a **$1.11/share special dividend**

refer to my previous point, at time of original DDs this was like 5 percent but now roughly 3.7 percent of share value

5.  Bonus: CEO is a baller with big balls and wants to stick it to hedge fundies who have been keeping his stock down - the company is not a meme stock, it has solid fundamentals but that is for a different post.

This one is funny I don't think I need to tell you why this isn't DD at all.

If you got in at 20, great! So did I and you made a great play and made some nice cash. Don't blow up your account letting some fucktard 2 month no post account shill you guys to death.

Is there still maybe some slight upside? There could be because people are retarded, but it's not a time to enter a new position but if you are in one to take some risk off the table and maybe let some of it ride if you like to gamble.",4,0,1614705771,TheVishual2113
