52,gqf0f8f,"So, I'm terrible. I know this. I apologise profusely. I'm selling my 50 shares of AMC to buy two more shares of GME. Feeling cute. Going to average up.

Disclaimer: I'm going to get more AMC because I like the stock. However, one share of GME is a ticket to the Goldilock Zone. My AMC profits will net me *TWO* SHARES! 

My original buy in of 30 shares was a limit purchase set at 69 bucks. What can I say? I'm a man of culture. I averaged down to 61 and change with another handful of shares. Then decided my diamond got harder when I averaged up. My next step was to bring my total to 81 and change. The final step is where I'm at as I make this post. My average is 91.26 with 58 shares. Two more shares at whatever the price is tommorow makes me moon! AVERAGING UP IS MY *key and Peele voices* SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT *destruction by tendies*
