3,gq8mfsb,"But people are doing it blue states too.  I have a friend who just bought in Truckee (CA) and it's the same thing.

A lot of it is people leaving urban areas.  I'm currently in SF and rents are down 30% (due to lots of vacancies)

Personally, I'm paying cash and it's my first house -- I've always rented.  I'm not sure how common that is.

On a side note, I think you have to be crazy to buy a house from some pictures online, without having seen it in person, and not even bothering to get a $500 inspection done.  It's amazing how good they can make some pretty crappy houses look with some well-aimed, well-lit pictures.",2,0,1615228535,Keith_13

29,gq8s2gq,"No.  They're like market makers. They get their spread regardless of the rates. 

They will end up having to cut their spread to fight off the big banks whenever those guys decide to wade in heavy.  They're underpaying their staff badly,  and they will revolt soon. 

There are no fundamentals for this company in the long term.  Rates are already rising,  which will trim their refinance business.  Independent brokers thrive during refinance booms, but many will cave when there's only purchase business to be had.  As they go,  so will umwc.
