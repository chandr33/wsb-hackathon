9,gqiw4u6,"Computers are really good at processing the information in real time. They can calculate X amount of dollars will cause a certain reaction. When the spread gets thin they crunch numbers even easier. It's no different than me looking at my LII and seeing that X amount of dollars on the ask will buy me X amount of shares for X amount of price. I would at that point calculate each strike point and cost basis to determine if I would turn a quick profit along the way until my order runs out of steam. Difference with me and institutions is that I can't see the hidden entries (stops and trailing stops, etc.).",20,0,1615430286,Wynslo

And depending on how much hashing power you generated with your X amount of PCs you got a slice of the 1 Popcorn. SETI does this community sharing computing to help find extraterrestrials (among other things).

Why can’t we apply that same idea algorithm to multiple PCs(and hardware) to look at that real-time data and make/buy positions?

And If we can’t see those hidden entries, how do we become an institution to see those?? As we’ve seen, people here have money.
