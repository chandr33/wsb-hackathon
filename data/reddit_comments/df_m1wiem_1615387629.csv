10,gqg8b8r,"I graduated high school in a small town in 2009, the effects of the crisis still affect me today. Jobs were already scarce and unemployment was high prior, suddenly the only jobs were fast food and farming. And even those quickly filled up. It became difficult to find a job, so I went to school. Even with amazing grades the best I could find was working in a small restaurant. 

Moved the hell out of that place to a bigger city but with such little work history employers rarely give me even a nod. My 5 shares isn‚Äôt much, but hopefully it‚Äôll ease some of the burdens. Cheers, daddy WSB üíé üôå",1,0,1615387937,up-and-cumming_rt

If GME trades at 10-12x sales multiple (which is conservative for an e-commerce evlautation) with 10 billion dollars in sales (at least, as they managed this as a brick an mortar company let alone a e-commerce company.

10 x 10billion = 100 billion market cap.Divided by 70 million shares

= $1428 USD per share OFF JUST CORPORATE EVALUATION AT THE BEGINNING.
