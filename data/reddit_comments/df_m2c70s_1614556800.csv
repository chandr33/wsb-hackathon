because, if we're being honest, institutions who are actually looking to exit positions have algorithms to do so without significantly affecting the stock price. which they would absolutely do in this situation cause it means they sell a majority of their shares near 350 as opposed to at 200. the only reason someone with enough shares to drop the price from 350 to 200 would not make use of such an algorithm is if they wanted the price to drop.

&gt; Washington, D.C., Feb. 24, 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted a **new rule to place certain restrictions on short selling when a stock is experiencing significant downward price pressure.** The measure is intended to promote market stability and preserve investor confidence.  
  
&gt; Short Sale-Related Circuit Breaker: The circuit breaker would be **triggered for a security any day in which the price declines by 10 percent or more from the prior day's closing price.**  
  
&gt; Duration of Price Test Restriction: Once the circuit breaker has been triggered, the **alternative uptick rule would apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day.**",2,0,1615423081,dudemanxx
