9,gqhxvlv,"Ok pep talk time. u/rensole and others on here predicted what happened today. They let the price run up to tease everyone, then they shorted the shit out of it while simultaneously flooding Reddit and the media with negativity. Make no mistakes about it, this is a war. It‚Äôs psychological warfare between you and big money, you‚Äôre trying to take what they have and they‚Äôre trying to stop you. Mentally prepare yourself for the fuckery because I fully expect them to drop another bomb on us on Friday. Today wasn‚Äôt shit, it‚Äôs the same old tactics that they‚Äôve been doing since January. If you bought in in the two or three hundreds and can‚Äôt afford to lose the money then get out. This ride is going to get rougher before it takes us to the moon.  Everytime they try to pull these lame-ass shenanigans against us only strengthens my resolve, and it tells me we‚Äôre on the right track. What we‚Äôre doing (as a group of individuals) can work, otherwise the powers that be wouldn‚Äôt be moving Heaven and earth to stop us. It can fucking work, we just need to hold. Even if they end up stopping the big squeeze from happening, the outlook of the company is pretty fucking bright, the stock price will eventually settle in the 100‚Äôs (at minimum). Don‚Äôt lose your nerve, just keep holding.",200,0,1615412904,plzkevindonthuerter

36,gqhxxcz,"&gt;TLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once.

Someone correct me but this isn't how shorting works at all. 

Hedgies can't borrow a bunch of shares then wait up to three days to sell them. The act of short selling is both borrowing *and* selling a share simultaneously. 

The three days (aka T+2) refers to the time the broker/MM has to actually locate the shares they lent to hedgies to short sell, and hand them over to whoever bought the shares from the hedgies.

The millions of shares you saw shorted in recent days went onto the market the instant they were short sold. They weren't saved up.

This dip was caused by a whale selling their shares en masse then buying them back at a discount due to all the paper hands and stop losses they triggered during the drop.",5,0,1615412926,smohyee
