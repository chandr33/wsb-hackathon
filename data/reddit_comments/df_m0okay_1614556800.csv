10,gq94spv,Fuck Altria and fuck their IQOS monopolize-the-market-and-kill-vape-small-businesses play. They're evil assholes and I'd rather short their stock and hope they fail.,0,0,1615236467,curunir
11,gq9577c,Wtf do you expect them to do? The government was trying to kill vaping singlehandedly. They needed a plan B.,1,0,1615236638,ConBroMitch
12,gq95n3y,"Iâ€™m loooong MO. 

Stuck this in my Roth and Iâ€™m going to forget about it for ~30 years. That dividend is too good to pass up.

14,gq9hqw8,"Who do you think got the government into the business of trying to kill vaping?

Altria. Their patent application for IQOS suspiciously coincided with the flow of grant money to the usual suspects to start a campaign against vaping. While the UK's NHS was finding vaping to be an excellent harm reduction strategy.

Altria literally bought the main competition, Juul, then shut it down.",1,0,1615242288,curunir
15,gq9je4b,"I don't disagree. As an Altria HQ born and raised vaper and cannabis lover, Altria has really fucked things and intentionally destroyed many mom and pop businesses. You should see the monstrosity of Virginia's ""legalization bill"" that they no doubt had a heavy hand in.

As an investor, I suspect Altria will come out ahead. I am so glad I dumped my annual roth into them last week. Stock increased 4 fucking percent today! That may be a company record.

I'm more bullish and comfortable dumping a large portions of my life savings into Altria than anywhere else. You can either fight them or profit off of them.",1,0,1615243079,ixikei

25,gszffj6,"This is the kind of bar room debate that makes my penis rowr.

The biggest threat to vaping is cheap non standardized crap from China â€” small producers can fill a lot of roles, even build a better mousetrap, but ultimately â€” itâ€™s going to demand capital, experience and rallying around a set of standards to become what the feds want â€” a legal, taxable income stream many people see as evil",1,0,1617241902,i_vix
26,gszg4a2,"IMO Juul is heir, iQOS is the spare â€” Altria didnâ€™t do a ton of favors here â€” but Juul did a grand job of market share at all cost before that tech style...  check out some of the unreported fixes

Govt was going to go after vaping one way or the other â€” regulate for safety or at the request of states wanting tax money

Theyâ€™re fine with huffing an HP inkjet cartridge as long as itâ€™s classified correctly and the check clears",1,0,1617242258,i_vix
