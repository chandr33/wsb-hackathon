You can read every poker book in the library and watch all the classic matches, etc...learn whatever you want... but if you are sitting down to play for the first time against me with any amount of money that you actually care about, I'll take it from you without working up a sweat.  I call it ""selling poker lessons"".  Once I have your stack,  you will have REALLY learned something... and I'm a smooth brained ape who is not really THAT good.

25k isn't THAT much (just look at our fabulous loss porn), it can be lost, and made back.  A 5k account, used wisely (a joke on wsb I know), and added to consistently over 2-3 years will give you experience and capital to go along with your self learning as there are multi-day scalps to be had just the same as there are intra-day.

If you can 5x your small account (not hard at all in this bull market of 20% YOY anyway), you probably deserve a chance at a larger stakes table.  Too bad our public education teaches us NOTHING about this stuff.

That's my main problem with the current regulations.

Loss porn exists BECAUSE of these regulations.

Since you can't buy and sell quickly, you are forced to make gigantic investments, which poor people can't afford.

Poor people could only invest with a scalper strategy, but they can only do that with $25k

Well, I really had no idea what options were at all until I skimmed a google page, but your explanation completely cleared it up.

In a way, tho, your explanation proves my original point.

The very fact that options, being way riskier, and having no limits, prove that these regulations only benefit a certain class of people. Or am I wrong?

Sure, you have to go through some settings to enable it. But there's no disabling the limit on stock trades except for a pay-wall.

56,gqerh03,"Then you shouldn't be scalping.

I get what you are saying, you want to momentum trade. You see a stock going up, you wanna buy it when it's up 3% and sell it up 5%.

That's well and good, but government rules are to protect you. Because MOST people that have small accounts, if they learn and have good rules to follow, will get to 25k. And then awesome. And if they don't, they'll blow up their account slightly slower.

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, scalping is not some amazing 5x a week scheme. 

Most scalps are .1-.2% trades, and if you are using proper risk management (obviously not, WSB and all), it should be at most 5% of your account.

So, let's say you risk 5% of your account per scalp, and manage to successfully scalp 100x in a day, no losses.

That's: $4 profit. Now, if you did that every day. 200x a year, that's 266% returns. Fantastic numbers really. 9.5 years at that rate, and you turn $1000 into a million

But.. That's not really feasible. That would require 190k successful scalps, no fails.

But you are WSB, so you'll invest your entire account. It would take 96 days, or 9600 successful scalps to hit 1 million, all in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say you ARE NOT so good. You average 4 successful, and one failure. Failure is a loss of .01%, success is +.01%

Then after 100 trades, you would have made 6.1%

&amp;#x200B;

So now you need 156 days to make that million.
