14,gqf9nsk,"Well, I mean that's easy to see yourself, just look at the option chain. Look how much it gained today. 
While GME had a FANTASTIC day today, 800C 3/12 lost 51% of their value. Even with significant gain tomorrow, that might still be the case, because of time value decreasing so rapidly relative to the day of expiration. Currently, with a value of 1.08 at close, gme would have to be at 801.08 for the contract to break even at close on Friday. To see a detailed breakdown of any options' likely price range due to this relationship between time value (extrinsic value) and intrinsic value, you can use a free tool like optionsprofitcalculator.com to look at it pretty quickly. Or a bunch of software options for pretty graphs.",1,0,1615361621,Irreversible_Tide

35,gqf9oqo,"Depends on ow much you got.  I've got Merril Edge, Schwab and Robinhood.  Schwab doesn't have the greatest interface on mobile, web, or PC, but has the best extended hours and some cool tricks you can do with conditional orders.  Merril has a decent interface on mobile and web but is slow on both.  It's PC application is maybe cool or maybe total ass.  IDK because am too retart to understand it.  RH is good if you're poor and don't care that they effed retail traders in the B on 1/28/2021.  Slick interface, easy access to options and margin, but it's heavily gamified so every gain and loss goes straight to your amygdala and destroys your dopaminergic system almost instantly.",1,0,1615361645,bzzzp
