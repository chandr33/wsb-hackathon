have you heard of AMS? This is Apple's sensor manufacturer. There is a rumor that Apple may pull out of AMS. Apple never confirmed this rumor. AMS took over Osram last year, resulting in synergies that lead to large savings. AMS is also broadly diversified and also manufactures products other than sensors. The fourth quarter of 2020 significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The company now also wants to pay a dividend again. The stock is listed in Zurich, today's price was approximately USD 22.28. Two shorties, Sylebra Capital Limited and Systematica Investments Limited, have been increasing their short positions since the beginning of February. that's why the price is falling.

Literally any green stock other than GME is a result of hedge funds buying up all the ladders at home depot and leaving them out front of local Gamestops.
 
In all seriousness, I laugh at the suckers celebrating their ""win"" with ""super duper serious stock"" RKT. You made 75% gains in a single day? Really? You *sold* your GME for gains before the drop like a *dumbfuck*, pumped it into RKT like a *fool*, and you think ""oh, look at me, I made a lot of money today and that's a good thing!""
 
Think again, bucko. I'll have you know that on the rare day that GME isn't lying motionless during missionary, my girl is dropping *as a trick* so that you money making paper hands get out, buy a new stock, and more than double your money.
 
You fucking morons don't see what's happening, do you? I'd laugh if it weren't so sad to see. You're sheep and don't even realize it. You think that being down on GME means I'm doing worse than you with almost 100% gains? You think I'm jealous with my 10 shares of GME @ 350? You think it bothers me *at all*?
 
We don't even *think* about you non believers in the GME thread. We care so little that we make sure to tell each other ""wow RKT is stupid"" or ""RKT is such a distraction I can't believe Melvin started paying shills with the promise of mooning RKT so when do we go up guys?""
  
I'm going to laugh in my dreams tonight thinking about how happy you stupidly feel to make a shit load more money than me today. Congratulations on forgetting that the only stock that existed before this week was literally Just GME.
