5,gqcu26h,"You don‚Äôt have the attack system correct. Pairing expiring out of the money calls and expiring out of the money puts are one method used to drive the price down. Another is phantom trading between MMs: entering lower and lower bids between each other. Also, if this was just the asset managers (HFs and other buy-side shops), how do you explain trade halts to the second on a dozen plus securities across exchanges, on ADRs (like NOK) and even after market halts to the minute? If this were just HFs, they would have taken their licks, taken alpha from the trades, and gotten the hell out. Someone would have their money lines cut. The big winners would be the stock loaners. The prime brokers lending the shares would get the cash on FTDs way above what they lent out plus the fees and interests for the loan. This reeks of artificial securities created out of thin air and manipulation from the top down. I have stated before that this can only come from the Fed, but ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people here who believe the fairy tales tell me that I‚Äôm wrong without offering any possible explanation as to who has that kind of ability. You‚Äôre watching Fed algos expose themselves with their precision and ability. This isn‚Äôt DTCC. This is far bigger than just catching a lion in a mousetrap.",10,0,1615313879,bblack2164

15,gqcyv3j,"Hmmm interesting theory.  So I definitely am aware the Fed is shady as hell and can absolutely buy anything with phantom money they create from their magical empty checking account.  I think they are the single biggest cause of inequality in our country and should be shut down.  I also don't believe that they will not do something because it's ""not in their charter"".  That being said, I don't see the Fed as plausibly having the abilities you describe.  The market makers like Blackrock seem like much more plausible catspaws for this (at the direction of the Fed? Sure).  You need to be deeply plumbed into the fabric of multiple markets with high frequency equipment to do the manipulation you suggest.  The Fed certainly can tell someone to do something like this, but I don't think they are directly doing it.",1,0,1615316195,TegidTathal

17,gqd5z0q,"So... a BlackRock can simultaneously halt trading across exchanges after hours but the Fed cannot? Does not the Fed directly engage in algo securities trading that it calls ""QE""? There was 300% of short interest over float on GME a couple of weeks ago and FTDs were, according to Finra and SEC, stacked up for weeks already. Your explanation doesn't fit. This isn't one big MM or even two. Why did Psaki pay Yellen 800k to meet with his firm and invite other PMs? Why would other AMs (like Cohen) step in to bail out seemingly disconnected fund managers? Why did Citadel have to take out another 1B in corporate paper last week after loaning it to other non-linked managers? Clearly these were not PMs who were competing with alpha strategies, this was a rigged game and they were in it together. The grift relies on the fact that they do not have to report short positions and the street vs book name of institutional ownership doesn't show a net change. They dilute and oversell the stock then bash the rest of the company over the head as shares are delisted and these same vultures seat themselves on the adhoc credit committee to wind down the rest of the company and hide their crimes. I think we are seeing that HFs are like street gangs that step on the final product to sling it out but the cartels are the central banks/Fed. They own the regulatory agencies the way narcos own cops and judges. If this rot is exposed (likely it will happen), then the financial tsunami that hits will make 2008 look like a belly flop.",2,0,1615319406,bblack2164

50,gqech7t,"Well I don't think it takes much to short, there is a small fee associated with it, and then you sell, giving you more liquidity to do whatever you want with. Then eventually you buy back the shares you borrowed and pocket the difference. Sell high, buy low. Seems like a natural thing that one would want to do, but it gets out of hand because there's next to no regulation, and there's a huge temptation with trying to push a company to bankruptcy because you get to keep all the money made from the sale and pay no taxes.",2,0,1615339904,BigDaddySteven

52,gqedhnp,"So when any investor buys shares, there's a way for them to be lent out. If you're on Robinhood for example, it's something that they do by default, plus they keep the proceeds. When they are borrowed for shorting, it's done by the owner still retaining ownership, and then the shorter sells them, without them buying from the owner at all, and the shorter keeps that money for the time being. Eventually they close their position by buying back the same amount of shares and returning them to the original owner. Something that happens when they have sold these shares though is that the new owner might also lend them out to be shorted, and this leads to there being more shares shorted than even exist, because the same shares can be shorted more than once.",1,0,1615340442,BigDaddySteven
