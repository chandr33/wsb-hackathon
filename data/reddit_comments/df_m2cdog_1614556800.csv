12,gqiclyg,"Nobody on this sub is buying gme right now because of fundamentals, and it isnt going up based on fundamentals, it is going up because SQUEEZE IS NOT SQUOZE. The fundamental analysis on this play is in the short interest and option interest not in the income statement and balance sheet. We are trying to project how much higher it could go based on these types of stats.",1,0,1615420010,ShyftyyIV

21,gqidn6w,I am a bot. This Discussion does not look like it has generated enough approval to stay on /r/wallstreetbets.
