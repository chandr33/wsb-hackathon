40,gqg5oy7,"Real shit post DD: You may have read about someone doing actual technical analysis and coming up with that the *real* price of GME in January could have gone to 130k. I'm not going to dispute that, but if this indeed does turn out to be the MOASS, there's a low-end to consider. When VW squeezed back in '08, it briefly became the largest company on earth by market capitalization.  A quick Google search tells us that the current largest company on earth is Saudi Aramco at $1684 billion followed by Microsoft bat $1359 billion. 

GME's current market cap is around $17billion so if we use VW's prior movement as a basis for comparison that may tell us that the high-end on price could be 79 times to 99 times higher than the current share price. For further support of this, I should note that Robinhood isn't accepting sell orders above $5,000 which means that's their way of doing damage control. Just somethings to consider for all folks talking about selling at $1,000 and or worse yet, submitting sell orders of $420.69.
