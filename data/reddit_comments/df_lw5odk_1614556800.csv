30,gpib12z,"Do you like Semiconductors? Y/N 
ANSWER: No 

\-Are you bullish on NVDA/AMD üöÄüöÄüöÄ Y/N
ANSWER: No - and the merger isn't happening. 

\-Do you think there‚Äôs a Semiconductor shortage? Y/N
ANSWER: Yes - and the problem is that the US can not just flip a switch and make more. 

\-Do you like 3x Leverage? 
ANSWER: Not.. of shit. 

\-Bearsüåàüêªsay: ‚ÄúShoRtaGe MeANs     LeSs PrOFitS‚Äù
ANSWER: Hmm.. or in this case, crash. 

\-Semiconductor manufacturers will raise prices leading to increased profit that scales with inflation! Semiconductors go brrrr 
ANSWER: Brrr, the sound of someone investing in SOXL as they go homeless from leveraging into a crisis. 

Do you really want to bet against:
\-Stimmy?üíâüí∞üí∞üí∞
ANSWER: Again, throwing money at the chips still means they cannot produce them, the old machines just have money on them now. 

\-Government (Nat‚Äôl Security) interventions?
ANSWER: Right, think of it as a crisis management team. Can't wait to find out what comes of the 100-day review üòÇ

\-Increased cryptomining, gaming, and EV/AI chip usage?
ANSWER: That is not what is causing the shortage. It's like you read about Biden's executive order and tried to make a story out of it that ended with chips going up. I get it.",0,0,1614752937,secureID2424
