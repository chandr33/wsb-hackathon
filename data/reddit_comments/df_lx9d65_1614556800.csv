5,gplqv7d,Well I didn’t read any of this but it sure does look like a very thorough and not completely retarded DD post. We need more of that around here.,5,0,1614821812,McPowPow
6,gplqzxi,"We’re pretending these valuations were reasonable even before Covid. Now the Fed is just holding up the 401Ks of Boomers with duct tape and glue by printing money. This ends eventually - badly. Yes, I’m a gay bear on the overall market but still throwing in calls on the same stonks as everyone here because I’m down for the cause and trendies. Just hedge the F up. I like to use calls in inverse ETFs like SDS, SDOW, and SQQQ as well as UVXY for volatility. Also, SCO because oil is waaaaayyy ahead of itself. But what the fuck do I know",12,0,1614821881,SameAsItEverWasss

11,gpmnozx,"You sort of yada yadaed over the best part. How are globalization, supply chains, and cheap labour curbing a “ quick rise in inflation”?",2,0,1614841301,MultifactorialAge
12,gpobegk,"we might see a spike in inflation in the short term but that is going to subside over time due to the factors I mentioned. you might be seeing a temporary spike in prices due to pent up demand and suppy side constraints, but as more countries reopen this won't be the case.

 Fed won't be concerned with inflation ticks around 3% for a few months, they would only be looking for a higher longer term average for the inflation and that won't be happening. This is also the reason why even after 2008 when we had quantitative easing, we could not tick a higher inflation number.",2,0,1614879365,StylizedPortfolio
13,gpoha53,"Well the reason for the lack of inflation since 08 is because the banks never actually lent out the QE money. They just increased their reserve with the FED (which has doubled since 2020). The market is pricing in inflation evident in the 10 year treasury yield bump. 
I agree that anything in the 3% range would probably be welcomed by the FED, but that also poses the risk of runaway inflation to which the FED can’t do much to stop other than raise rates. Since the market has become so sensitive to rate increases, I can safely say that JPOW has his work cut out for him.

On a side note: I miss these types of discussions on WSB.",3,0,1614881856,MultifactorialAge
