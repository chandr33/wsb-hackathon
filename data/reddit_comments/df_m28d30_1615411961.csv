2,gqhvql0,"**4:23 Closing Bell Update**

50,000 shorts were pulled out then put back in, probably what drove the price down before ending at 265. This is lower than where GME was at earlier today, but this is higher than we were yesterday even after accounting for the massive short attack today. What will the SHITers do tomorrow with only 150,000 shorta available? Honestly, I have no idea. That massive attack still did not stop the overall trajectory, and they'll have to reload before injecting another shot.

Journey before destination. We all want our tendies, but learning why the process works the way it does will help us navigate through future endeavors. The best part about this sub has been how we collectively have all been learning so much about how the financial world really works. We've used one another as guides to help us learn and grow together. Stay strong apes, for the future is at hand.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 265.00",59,0,1615411964,Corno4825
