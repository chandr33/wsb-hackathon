3,gplis7g,"BIGJAY, you really put in 14,500 shares? You really think this company will MOON? I have been hesitant on SPACs as they have be volatile and sometime the merger comes out with worse terms than expected. Besides why coulden't they just IPO is they had nothing to hide?",1,0,1614817188,beck800

6,gpo6377,The private companies in the launch business are the real innovators here. RocketLabs is actually capturing a healthy share of the small satellite market and is a big presence in this area already.,3,0,1614877081,viburnum608

8,gpo8dh3,"Used to be in the space industry. The Electron serves a different market than ULA. They specialize in small satellites and constellations, which are going to see the most growth over the next 10 years. The newer rocket they are building is more on the medium side, and still better serves that market than ULA. I’m pretty bullish on this.",1,0,1614878066,viburnum608

14,gtmeui1,"I don't know if I'm just retarded, but I really don't understand how this is still sitting at about $11 right now.

Like you've said, this is a very rare case of a recently founded aerospace company that actually has a proven track record, and yet others that haven't proven much of anything are in the same ballpark or higher with their market caps.

I don't mind, I'm intending to hold shares in RKLB for a long time, but I'm just really surprised there hasn't really been any hype around this yet.

The worst case scenario for me is I lose my money investing in this company that I truly believe in, so if it all goes to shit and I lose everything I've invested, I'm ok with that. I will be much sadder for the loss of such a promising NZ company than I will be for the money I'll have lost in that situation.",1,0,1617747620,TheMokos
