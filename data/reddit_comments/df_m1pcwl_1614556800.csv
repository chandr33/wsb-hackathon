3,gqevr4o,"I did the same after all the shit went down, but did a partial transfer and left $3 in my account just so it’d stay open.  Too much funny business going on with them.  It still took a good 10 days to have my shares show up in TD.",4,0,1615350819,campb029

6,gqew1ka,Lovely. Yeah they said 5-7 business days in the email. That's fucking eternity for meme stocks. Did you lose any gains because of it? That's what I'm expecting. I was up ~$500. That's a lot for the amount of money I have to gamble with.,1,0,1615351009,whiskeydoc501
7,gqewayd,"No, didn’t lose much.  Had a bunch of NOK at a low cost basis and didn’t want to risk selling, letting it settle, then transfer cash due to the the volatility at the time.  Worked well....just took longer than it should have, but that may have been due to the large wave of people doing it at the time.",1,0,1615351179,campb029
8,gqewcgc,"This may come as a shock to you, but this is not RH customer support.",1,0,1615351205,Dan_inKuwait
9,gqewevz,"Yea I should've transferred earlier. It took like 8 days or so for Fidelity to open an account for me, while I was waiting I looked at TD Ameritrade and they allow 24 hour trading so I decided to use them, and they had my account open the same day. Then 3 days later, boom suddenly RH account is deactivated after hours with no warning.",2,0,1615351248,whiskeydoc501
10,gqexgpy,"Oh that's good at least! Yea I should've closed out my positions but I had no idea when it would start transferring. Definitely didn't expect it to happen at freakin' 10:40 at night, with zero advanced warning. 

RH probably saw I had made nearly a 20% gain that was still going up and Vladimir Tenev ""appreciated the opportunity"" to fuck over another customer.",1,0,1615351943,whiskeydoc501
11,gqeyhg0,"Yeah...bunch of turds.  I had most of my stuff with TD a while back anyway, but got roped in with the easy options trading and free stock.  I pretty much saw it as a secondary account from the get-go, but ultimately wound up paying a transfer fee.  Live and learn.  I’ve definitely learned more expensive lessons.

But yeah, no clue what will happen in the near term across the board.  Looks like volatility here for a little while until the market is sure the 10yr stabilizes below 1.5%.  Then you’ll have many putting their stimulus into the market in late March, which should create more demand in general in the market, although some have probably front run that.  Good luck and hopefully it works out in your favor!",1,0,1615352638,campb029
12,gqeypjf,"Thanks! Who knows, maybe they'll shoot past my limit sells in the meantime and I'll actually make more lol. Doubt it, but ya never know.",1,0,1615352791,whiskeydoc501
13,gqezx2x,"Nothing is impossible at the moment it seems.  I had $100 left over after a recent buy and figured I’d take a flyer on the 4/9 $2 SNDL call options.  Stock immediately tanked and options lost half their value over 2 days.  Today alone, they recovered all and then some with earnings still to come next week.  It’s a pot stock so has potential to double over the slightest bit of news or better earnings, but in reality it’s not a top tier company in the sector due to the recent share dilution.  They did raise some cash off the recent spike several weeks back, but it’s more of a deal to keep my interest.  Wouldn’t shock me if it halved in value again and doubled my return yet from from here.  Crazy times right now...",1,0,1615353636,campb029
