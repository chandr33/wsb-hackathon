1,gqg9f12,"Their revenue is all contract driven, so it doesn't easily go down. They launched a Dropbox equivalent(sold through IT providers) somewhat recently, and I've heard good things about it. No idea on how well it has sold though, and this is only their 2nd ER ever as a public company. Could go either way at this early stage. I'm a believer in the company long term, so I own shares, but the options play around an ER seems decent risk/reward.",1,0,1615388440,Iamabadhuman
