24,gqg8swy,"Honestly, mostly good timing on weekly calls. My first trade on the account was on XOM weeklies on I think like 2/8. Bought those cuz it had just broke $50 and was super close to breaking recent highs. Made 70% on it next day. Today, my gains were all thanks to SPCE. I bet on the tech comeback continuing; went in on SPCE thoughout yesterday and then dropped $2000 into calls 2 minutes before close since it had held all of its gains that day and was still only trading at half its recent high",1,0,1615388161,Niriro

Told myself I‚Äôd sell it if It ever went back to 200 and thanks to you retards it‚Äôs almost at 300 and I‚Äôm still holding and gonna hold no matter what!
