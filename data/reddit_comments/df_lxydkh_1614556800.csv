6,gppr3i3,"I've been in Ocugen since .71! Have been averaging up, wish I bought way more below $1. I rode NVAX from $12 all the way to $130... I paper-handed before it jumped to $300. I have been following OCGN since.

This is some good DD! I think a lot of people are doubting the vaccine's potential. Also, 81% efficacy for that type of vaccine is REALLY good. The mRNA vaccines from Moderna, J&amp;J, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca only achieved their efficacy results because of the newer technology they used. Which only adds to people's reluctance to take it.

I don't have much else to say, you've said everything else people need to know! Oh, and I believe this reads out their short interest: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/ocgn](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ocgn)",11,0,1614902002,f0rce44

8,gpps2hf,"There offering 98 million shares up later this month as part of a dilution. There's a meeting about it on the 15th and the most recent shareholder letter is out on Google about it.

JFC people are dumb, and if they lost money on this they deserve to",1,0,1614902502,sjrotella
9,gpps6gv,They have a shareholder vote on the 15th about dilution shares with another 98 million to flood the market. You will lose money on octn if you hold it long,-5,0,1614902561,sjrotella

11,gppslum,I understand that. As if that's the ONLY upcoming catalyst for this stock. I'm not worried about it at all. They are obviously working on something with massive potential.,1,0,1614902783,f0rce44

Not quite true, there won't be a flood of shares, they just want them there if they need them. Its not a direct offering, they're going to need the shares available to ramp up manufacturing, attract decent staff etc.",8,0,1614902919,jimmybwana
14,gppsxbn,"IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN YOU NUMBSKULL.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD CATALYST. 

Unless you're planning on holding for a long time, dump your shit before the vote and then buy after the shares flood and make everything cheap again.",-10,0,1614902945,sjrotella
15,gppt5ks,"Thats not true, it's not a dilution. Google it properly and you'll see whats happening. Ramping up to manufacture millions of vaccines for an indefinite period is going to cost money, how else are they supposed to get it? This is a paperwork exercise until FDA EUA, by which time, the dilution will happen, and rightly so, at which point, it wont affect the share value.",8,0,1614903059,jimmybwana

21,gppva74,"I got the letter in my email earlier this week.  I don't think I had the shares long enough to get anything about the January shareholder meeting.

I took my gains I made and plan on buying back in after the flooding of shares.  I believe long term in the company, but not in the next few weeks.  I'm here to make money, not be an advocate.",1,0,1614904132,sjrotella

24,gppw76d,"Oh, I read that differently. In that case, I'm glad you got some gains but why not just vote against the dilution of shares?

Especially if your average was that low.. why sell and buy-in at a higher average? You could've held and bought the massive dip you think is coming... especially if you believe in the company long term. Which doesn't seem like it if you sold your shares already.",3,0,1614904602,f0rce44
