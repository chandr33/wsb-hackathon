1,gpl31ee,"For the record...the subwars started from u/richtofin115 being wholesome and telling someone they weren't alone for holding KTOS. Then he suggested I make a sub for it as he did for SOXL because there wasn't one. Then maybe it was me that was like ""and I'll beat you joins"" or him - I can't remember. All I remember is I beat him. 

But now I don't know what to do because it's not like info comes out every day for KTOS, and I don't know what he's going to do because the split happened, and neither of us intended to take anyone down with us, but also - what play isn't fukd? lol
