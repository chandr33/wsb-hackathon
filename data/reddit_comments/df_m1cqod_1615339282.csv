5,gqebm81,"You'll get there. It took about 2 weeks for everything to transfer from mine and some of it went piecemeal. I managed to get everything right before the bottom of the dip.

They'll wait a bit to transfer funds from fractionals/anything that was liquidated prior to the ACAT transfer and they only move money once a week. If it settles after that day, you'll have to wait until the following week. Fidelity still doesn't have the cost basis data, though, so I have a spreadsheet to track everything.",2,0,1615339445,ClamPaste

90,gqehr0q,"I don't think it's much different than TD from what it sounds like based on general google research (I opened a ToS account, but never used it).  Preference more than anything, depending on how you use it.  There are quite a few ""pro/con"" articles out there that give a good idea.
But for me, the biggest pro for Webull is there are no fees for option trading.  Webull also has Cryptotrading (though not a ton of them, just the big ones).  Webull has a decent screener, good financial research capabilities, a comment section (acts a lot like reddit or stocktwits, tbh) - which is actually super helpful when you're not entirely sure why a stock just popped or dumped.  I've often times jumped into the comments, and someone has posted a screenshot of a news piece I missed somewhere.  Way faster than going to another platform or searching for the news yourself.
And the thing about it being new... it's already amazing, and it's only getting better.
Also the extended hours are SUPER helpful.  Webull has them from 4am - 8pm ET, which is 1 hour earlier than TD.  And I love that 4am time haha, so much happens!  I made 1k off a trade purely because of that 4am time permit.  (I'm Mountain Time, so 2am kinda sucks, but when I know something is going to pop first thing, it's nice to just stay up and catch the run)

I can't honestly tell you if it's better than TD, just because I personally haven't used TD - and if you watch YouTube videos about them both, everyone has good things to say about both platforms.  I just think Webull edged it out for me based on the lack of fees, and the free stock promotions.  I got $60+ in free stocks for joining.  2 for adding $100 to my account, 2 for using a referral when I opened my account, 2 for getting a referral, and 2 for spinning their promotional wheel because of the referral.  So yeah - worth it when you're basically being paid to join a free service.  I'm not even counting the 5 stocks I'm going to get for transferring my RH account either.  Those don't show up until 4/20.  So we will see.",2,0,1615342732,ceerz
