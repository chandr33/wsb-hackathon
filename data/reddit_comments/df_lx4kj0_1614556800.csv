In practice, I‚Äôd think if you have 117% returns on Apple already you‚Äôre giving those stonks to your great grandkids.

26,gplzfcm,"Personally, I have come across A LOT of people in real life talking about stocks/Gamestop during  the start of it. Bot accounts I wouldn't doubt, but there is absolutely no way millions of bot accounts are currently subbed to WSB. 

I'm sure reddit has a way to detect it. Plus, what is the benefit of bot accounts besides upvoting/downvoting? Although it is important and determines what the general public sees on the front page.... well you know, maybe they were bot accounts. 

Jk lol but while Wallstreetbets saw its influx in members, Robinhood was #1 downloaded that week in the APP store, with weBull behind it. I know there are A LOT of new investors/new money in the market because of that information of the downloads, and the people I've come across IRL new to it.",2,0,1614826073,Mattt029

29,gpm2q58,There is definitely a way there are bots and fake accounts subbed to WSB. There is a 100% chance there are other state actors accounts as well. Fake accounts have been a big issue on reddit for years. WSB is more heavily modded than a lot of subs but go to WSB elites sub and see how big an issue it is.,2,0,1614827764,DimesOnHisEyes
