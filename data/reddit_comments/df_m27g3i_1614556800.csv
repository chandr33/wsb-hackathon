6,gqho7l3,"No, no, no... This is what happened today:

The hedgefunds had been buying stocks with us and so they accumulated a large share of the stocks (this lost them a few million, but they thought that it was worth it).
Anyways, they all sold at the same time which got some paper handed morons to sell all there stocks (because they were dumb enough not to expect this) and because of that the price fell to $190.

However, the hedgefunds thought that we would all sell of our stocks immediately when we saw the drop, some paper hands were dumb enough to fall for their trick but most of us retards actually bought stocks when it it rock bottom (buy low sell high) and so we now start the slow road to recovery. 

Btw, we literally theorised this was gonna happen 2 days ago (we were right but we didn't think it was gonna happen this soon)

Don't panic, this was all expected!",2,0,1615408712,ERMMTJP

8,gqjierz,"Yeah exactly, it's gonna take a while it might even decline a little bit these next couple of days but my prediction is that there is gonna be almost no change till Monday.",1,0,1615443472,ERMMTJP
