""The short sale rule (SSR) is triggered when a stock goes down more than 10% from its prior close. SSR remains on a stock for the rest of the trading day when it‚Äôs triggered and remains on for the following trading day as well!  

The SEC made this rule to prevent short sellers causing a stock to tank. All it really does it make it difficult to short. The people who want to short are still going to short the stock.""

If these values are proven correct, my calculations have the peak value at $1080+/-$110 based off the previous 52 week high. Plan accordingly if my values for tomorrow and friday math where the stock closes.

Only time will tell if I am correct, but I am excited to see today's trends.

My calculations are based off a proportional mapping of our current values to the equivalent points on the chart of the January run up. My hypothesis is that we are following the trends we saw in January close enough that the currant EoD values can be mapped to EoD values from the January trend lines.",15,0,1614871676,Prohamen
