63,gqgylju,"The squeeze happened just now guys. Now it's crashing. It's not going back up today, maybe tomorrow. If you want to buy in, do so. But you need to remember that holding isn't going to make the price go back up. Only buying will. Im not telling you to buy, but you need to realize that new shorts keep opening and holding your shares isn't going to stop them from covering. Look at the mad volume being traded. You think they can't cover their shares because you held a few thousand shares? It's not going to stop it. Just remember that the only way for this to go back up is to buy more if you are able and willing and close your app. Don't let your emotions control it.
