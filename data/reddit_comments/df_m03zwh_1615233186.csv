11,gqejsk3,We are literally going to have a chance to enter at the same price (slated to be $45) as the big guys who invested in it in a round a few months ago since it is a direct offering.

15,gqfiolo,Roblox revenue growth is on another level to Activision and that's before they integrate advertising... Not comparable to an 'old fashioned' games publisher,1,0,1615370285,i_am_atoms
16,gqfnwh7,"Uhh...

25% net loss on their highest revenue to date.

During once in a lifetime event that maximises audience retention.

They haven't addressed why they lost so much. They haven't addressed their plans to sustainably grow without bleeding cash. They haven't discussed plans for development or change or future directions of the game.

It's a cash grab before it tanks.

17,gqfyict,So... buy in at the start and sell when it reaches a decent height? It ain't like you're supposed to hold it until you're bleeding out of every orifice from the weight of the bags. You could even sell it next Monday after buying today and likely get a decent profit. Otherwise just set alerts and limit sells or buy puts later on to offset.,1,0,1615382888,upupuplightweight
