4,gqify3d,I drew a trend line yesterday based on the manipulation that has been happening around open and close prices. It was supposed to close at 300 today based on that line.  It looks like the algo dumped the price down to like 302 when it fired up.  I kinda think it wasnâ€™t expecting the stop losses to dump the price down as a result. Then the algo tried (and failed) to get the price back up to 300.,2,0,1615421780,gonnaitchwhenitdries

16,gqit967,Same. I checked the price and notice GME was halted at $302 and it just missed my $300 stop loss. Then I sat there and watched like an idiot praying it would rebound when trading resumed. I bought back in after my stop loss and was able to pick up more shares since the price dropped further than what I sold for.,0,0,1615428768,wo1f-cola

19,gqizga2,Do the math you damn ape. 8 TRILLION in assets. Letâ€™s do some napkin math based on the values you have provided...letâ€™s say BR has 10 million shares of GME @ $200 a share. Thatâ€™s $2 Billion. Whatâ€™s $2B of $8T? 0.00025...or 0.025%...Thatâ€™s a spec of salt amongst sand on a beach. Why would they care enough to manipulate GME when itâ€™s a fraction of a percent of their total assets under management?,-1,0,1615432077,scotchdouble

21,gqj49fv,"I don't really buy that argument, mainly because Blackrock isn't a single entity. If GME goes to 0 that's some VPs bonus out the door and possibly their job as well. Blackrock as a company may not care about losing a billion dollars in the drop today, but the fund manager who's bonus is based on performance sure as shit does. That being said, let's ignore all that though and just say we'll agree to disagree on whether Blackrock cares about losing that money. 

There are 10+ hedge funds that all have about a 5% or more stake in GameStop. Maverick Capital owns about 7% and controlls 15b in assets, Senvest owns 7% and has 3b assets under management. Both of these are comparable in size to Melvin and GME is a much more significant portion of their portfolio. Why are they allowing the shorts to manipulate the stock price?",1,0,1615434843,Drugba
22,gqjb2bc,"I fear that When the damn inevitably breaks even the shorters will probably go long with bigger bets than all of us, possibly pocketing huge profits and and creating a sell off from higher levels that we wonâ€™t all escape. They could even make the price so outrageous the sec feels it must be curtailed, with some kind of finite pie to be distributed that they hold a significant portion of when that moment arrives.

My guess EPS will show negative for sure, but the driver will be +/-  for the analysts projected EPS and revenues.

38,gqkpt0j,"Sure gamma squeezes are more dangerous to short-gamma party than to the long-gamm. It depends on a number of variables, the driver is retail owning long gamma and not dynamically offsetting it with anything. That makes the market makers short gamma. The MMs want to stay neutral. To do that, they have to buy on the way up and sell on the way down. This gets worse near expiration because ATM gamma increases as the expiration date gets closer. It doesnâ€™t stop until the price moves far enough that the ATM gamma * open interest decreases (which depends on open interest at the current price). So. Once the gamma is gone, the wild swings go away, and either (a) the next expiration has the same problem, or (b) the trade disappears. Gamma squeezes typically end at a specific option expiration date, but predicting which one or the price is not possible. The best (flawed) metric I can think of would be aggregating all gamma *open interest across all expirations and strikes. When that number falls off it probably means the squeeze is over and whoever holds the bag will want to dump it.",1,0,1615472711,ActionJ2614
