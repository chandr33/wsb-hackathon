Because PC parts are a prerequisite for PC gaming, just like an Xbox is a prerequisite for Xbox gaming.

NVidia did nothing. You know how much drivers fighting mining will do ? Nothing. As I said many times before you can get dedicated 3rd party drivers already. They will make shit a tiny bit harder but not like 50% more like 0.1%.

It will not. 

What GME could do is promote alternative products. Example would be 30xx laptops which you can buy shit tones of now. Gaming laptops with 30xx are available like crazy.

You can‚Äôt get card, but you can get 30 laptops.

Mandate restrictions on publishers using the platform like forbidding third party DRM, and a bunch of other things too numerous to list.  Digital distro offers a lot of advantages and we've not seen hardly any of them used in gaming because of retail distribution agreement contracts.  There are a million possibilities, and GameStop is pretty uniquely situated if they're willing to switch their stance from fighting against digital distribution because it threatens retail to the polar opposite and going hard AGAINST retail (that's what they think, anyway, but it really wouldn't threaten retail as much as they think... record stores all closed because they flat out were not willing to renegotiate their retail distribution agreement contracts, they weren't even willing to TRY to coexist, preferring to close their doors, that doesn't HAVE to happen with physical game distro).",1,0,1615307376,otakucode
