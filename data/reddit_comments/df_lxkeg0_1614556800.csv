11,gpnh5m2,"Fun fact, open interest doesn't show what people creating all of these squeeze data sheets and shit think it means.

Think about the following scenario:

* You're glossy brained, so you buy to open an $800 call expiring tomorrow. A MM sells to open to you.

* I want to short a $800 call expiring tomorrow, so I sell to open, but the same MM takes the other side of my trade and buys to close

* The MM is now net 0 contracts at that strike

Now what is the open interest and how much is this going to cause the MM to delta hedge (hint, they won't because they don't hold any contracts, in my you and I do).

Now consider the scenario where MM A took the other side of your trade and MM B took the other side of my trade. Both of these MMs need to hedge in opposite directions.",87,0,1614865632,aint_no_lie

What about at share value of 120? Does this create any squeeze or pressure mathematically?

Pressure is needed to create a buying frenzy amongst the funds and institutions and MM to drive the price.  If theres no pressure at 120 and they are happy to trade at this, it will be 120 when we reach march 19.",13,0,1614875705,Disposable_Canadian
