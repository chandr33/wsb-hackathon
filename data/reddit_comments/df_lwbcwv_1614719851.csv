13,gpgmz5n,Nice gains! I bought in yesterday morning as well and secured quite a bit. In with 1k and out with 14k. I for one would love to see some of the picks your bot comes up with.

29,gpgzc7s,What do you look at specifically? Like option volume? Just share volume? Where do you look for news and what do you look for in the news that might tip you off? And what libraries are you using for sentiment analysis? I have tried a few but they don't understand WSB language. Obligatory congrats and fuck you.,1,0,1614726391,Banshee--
