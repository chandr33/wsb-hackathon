I am involved in a business that grows tomatoes and margins are quite tight. A volume game and while they may have aspirations to grow larger, this stock is so overvalued it’s insane.    I’d stay far, far away until it drops to single digits.

To be very clear...this is the future of growing.  My intention is to communicate that at this price, this stock is well overvalued.",10,0,1614716600,Fit_Mess4686

4,gpgg5vf,"I bought the stock and sold it the other day when I actually did the math on the wholesale value of tomatoes and how many they were projecting selling and for the life of me could not understand where the substantial profits to justify the valuation came from.

People are buying this and are blinded by the feel-good aspect, but I just don't see the this paying out.",5,0,1614717787,aka0007

8,gpgkuxd,It's up 200% + since September. It has been recently shitting the bed or 'correcting'. I'll wait until this falling blade turns around before looking at it but I'll add it to the old watch list.,0,0,1614719759,SwordfishFrosty2057

16,gph92kq,"Not a lot of public companies.  Most are private.  The ones that’d be public that you can review are Village Farms international - stock ticker VFF - (now getting into more Cannabis than produce).  
The other thing to note is that this company is only growing crops.  They give their product to a third party who’s selling it for them.  Essentially having no control over the sale of their product.",2,0,1614731349,Fit_Mess4686
