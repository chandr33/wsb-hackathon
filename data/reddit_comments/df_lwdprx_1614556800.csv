5,gpgtp2t,I'm in e-commerce and bought $4k worth of big c the first week. It's a good company. No clue why it's so cheap. Good product. Good position in the market. This stock is definitely undervalued,2,0,1614723678,Comfortable_Artist17

7,gpgz6ja,"BIGC lockup just ended Feb 1 and their execs have been offloading shares, $11m worth in the last week. Their VCs are also going to be continuing to offload shares as well. Until some of the early investors have reduced their positions in BIGC don’t expect a short squeeze.",1,0,1614726313,miles_crotch

16,gpo1bvj,"I work in e-commerce services and the two platforms that are getting a lot of attention right now are Bigcommerce and Lightspeed.  Of course Shopify is still the most popular due to their marketing, but when it comes to established businesses (the ones with revenue and profits), they are consistently choosing Bigcommerce for e-commerce and Lightspeed for their retail POS.

I was also an early shopify investor and now I'm heavily invested in lspd and bigc.",5,0,1614875032,hapa604
