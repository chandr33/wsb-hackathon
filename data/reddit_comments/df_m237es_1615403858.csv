0,gqhcsf7,Lol hedge funds of making bank on this too. Then at the top they‚Äôll take out more shorts and manipulate the market for the stock to crash again. The retail investor will be stuck holding the bag again. Rinse and repeat,0,0,1615403860,ArmedWithBars

12,gqhcsq0,"Sqqq is an etf that shorts the Nasdaq. Gme is in the Nasdaq. When sqqq goes up, it short companies like gme 3 times the money put in. If the hedge funds convince 90% of America that inflation fears are real, they will pile into sqqq and crash the entire nasdaq along with us while they get out. 

If this doesn‚Äôt make sense, the plan isn‚Äôt for you, it‚Äôs for a big money backing the stock. Gme stock needs the gme ‚Äòsharks and whales‚Äô in here to push down sqqq before other unknowing Americans push it into a momentum buy",1,0,1615403864,ASengerd
