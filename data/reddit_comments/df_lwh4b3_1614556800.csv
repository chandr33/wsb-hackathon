47,gphley6,"AMC issuing shares does not exactly protect shorts. They sold shares to gain revenue in order to rule out bankruptcy. Fact of the matter is, shorting a stock is betting against them. Ruling out bankruptcy kind of hurts short sellers in the long term but helps them short term. 

GME and AMC went about it differently but they are also 2 different companies with different issues. I understand what you wrote but I disagree with it. GME is still imo a strong stock but that is irrelevant to the post. The post is about AMC and we can argue about AMC if you want? I have not much negative to say about GME.
