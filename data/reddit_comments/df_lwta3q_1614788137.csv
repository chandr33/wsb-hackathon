12,gpjsuv4,"&gt; What conclusion I have come to is this. If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community. I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction. Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down. Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC. I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart. And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work. Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.

This is why a good DD, with other people giving their own DD's, are valuable.

The idea that RKT is a bad play, and is contrived, is a joke. You're a joke. This subreddit is a GME cult. And its a joke. A company whos stock was at 22.80 at the opening on Monday, after announcing that they would be paying a 1.10 dividend to the share holders at close of market on the 9th of January (5% of share value) IS A SURE THING. They smashed earnings too.

The old guard of WSB came in with RKT in their hands, kicking and screaming and letting all the smooth brained apes that they can make a killing on RKT if they just get in and get out. BUT NO.
