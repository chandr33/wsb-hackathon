5,gqclxec,Go look what your shit is worth right this second and decide if you can live with that number being 0. That is a real possibility by the time 3/12 comes around. As far as what it is worth... Holy shit let me tell you which way the wind is blowing real quick. Even if I give you an accurate answer for right this second it is gonna change by the minute and you want a fucking prediction of the future.,1,0,1615310309,Ditto_D
6,gqcm4l2,"Your contract will be worth ((Current GME price) - 355)\*100 if the current GME price is above $355  (There are other factors such as volitility and time to expiration to consider, but if you are close enough to expiration then the price will be quite close to what I stated above).  If you exercise that option, you have to buy 100 shares at $355, so unless you have $35,500 laying around that you want to gamble on GME going even higher then you should sell the contract.

You need to sell the contract before the market closes or else it becomes void and worthless.",2,0,1615310396,ill_thump_your_icky
