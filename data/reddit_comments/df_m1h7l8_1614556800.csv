7,gqdml43,"I love this outlook. You're a survivor but you aren't letting that define you. You will use the opportunity that comes across your desk to make something lasting and better.

That's the key, though: don't piss your money away. Think about your debt capacity, and for example, what paying off a 4% mortgage means versus using this influx of cash to make 8+% somewhere else. You can float that debt if your money makes more being used elsewhere. 

Always think out of the box and decide if you should pivot. Here's a good example that I always tell people:

You know how people are all obsessed with rockets and space now? Everyone wants to start the next SpaceX. Well you wanna know who's making BANK right now? United Rentals, that's who. They rent cranes and technicians to all the rocket companies to move their heavy equipment. Someone at UR looked outside the box and realized that they could tap into something that no one else is looking at because it isn't shiny and flashy. Think that way and you can turn a small business into a massive, profitable operation.

K I'm done.

Best of luck!!!",1,0,1615326771,RangerKings
