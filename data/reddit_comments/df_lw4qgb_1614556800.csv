5,gpfbj3q,"The actual debit on margin accounts short that stock will occur 2 days before div payment is made, however the credit departments may require earlier payment. The div payment will be treated as a debit on buying power of margin accounts, so as long as a short seller has enough to cover the dividend, there is no issue, they can continue to be short. The issue is, how much longer do you want to be short on a company that has such good fundamental prospects and is about to cost you a huge one time cash debit?
