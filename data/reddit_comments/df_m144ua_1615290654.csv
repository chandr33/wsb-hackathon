23,gqbgoam,"10 minute study sessions, with timer. Then you do markets for 10 minutes.

Slowly change the amounts over time. Tie it to what you love and your brain will take over.

Also stretch and move before reading. No music if you can. Chunk that shit and then trick your mind to make it a habit.

Also if you don't do well on your test, Ryan Cohen might not be proud of you. 

Elon might not get us the biggest üöÄ for hitting a thousand.

Don't cram for tests, space it out. If you study high or drunk, then test that way.

Model your studying to as close to the test as you can.

Good luck mate",1,0,1615290688,Space4Time

95,gqbgt8s,"They split the stock at whatever number they choose, and succeeded the price the same, so it's a net neutral, but you have more shares at a cheaper price, which allows people to buy in a popular stock for cheap.

If they did a 10 to 1 split, for example, you'd get 10x as many shares you currently have, but the value is also divided by 10 - so your total value is the same as it started, but now it's easier for more people to buy. Tesla did this at a 5 to 1 split when their price per share was reaching $1200 (I think), and even after that the stock rose to almost $900 before this recent drop. The people who were in before the split had their shares multiplied by 5, so when the price went up again they got way more out of it for free basically",1,0,1615290799,C10UDWA1KER
