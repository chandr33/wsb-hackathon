2,gqanaur,Why do you think it took the fed to do that? Hedge funds applied downward pressure with shorts and maybe puts while RH stopped the buying. The news that RH wouldn’t allow buying pretty much routed everyone and convinced them it wasn’t going higher. Idk why the Fed needs to be involved for that to have happened,1,0,1615265060,ForShotgun
3,gqand3t,"""The squeeze"" is based upon fake numbers that no one as access to but the funds themselves. All sorts of percentages are floated here. Reality is we have zero idea how many stock are shorted by whom and what the interest rate they are paying for them. Is it heavily shorted? It was. Now? Maybe still heavy by industry standards but possibly much lighter. Either way, if they buy some shares watch the price rise then everyone retailer holder start a massive sell-off. The HF doesn't have to buy any more shares as people here baghold whilst others sell smartly for a profit with the same result of price dropping.

Supply and demand and the HF can control the demand since they have the capital and SEC on their side.",-2,0,1615265102,Qwinntuss

8,gqanyfp,"Sure it can. Never said it couldn't. And it might be worth every penny of that. But it didn't just shoot up there it is built upon decades of smart investments by WB. It has tangible value. 

GME somehow shooting up to even a single point of that is laughable and would cause an instant halt. That's not to say it won't go up some more in the coming days but it will come down. There's nothing to support it just like last time.


DFV DD was based upon something like 50/sh as reasonable. These spikes are just hype that come and go. It is a stock worth hanging on to but at a much lower price point. I would have sold by now but I unfortunately wrote calls on mine. I'll profit if someone exercises but if they don't I believe in the stock for the long term and intend to by back my calls when it all crashes down.

I expect another spike even after that and will gladly sell them then and buy back when people finally lose interest.

As stuff opens up after covid this extra play in the markets by bored people will wane.

17,gqaoq0n,"Speculation certainly is a major part of it at this point, yes. Numbers are important, yes. And yes, we don't have access to the exact numbers, and more than likely those shorting GME are and have been heavily concealing their true positions.

But none of this is restricted entirely to fundamentals and numbers. At its core trading is partly based off the emotions of buyers and sellers. I know people like to say ""Trade without emotion"", but the saying only applies in a world where all parties involved are without emotion. It is not based in reality.

If share holders want to hold then they will hold. It is up to those who desire their shares to manipulate their emotions so that they sell, and this can be done any number of ways, both legal and illegal. At this point in the game if one takes into account the psychological battle taking place then one is brought to another conclusion: the squeeze is still real and ongoing. The evidence is everywhere. Retail aren't the ones frightened at this point: those who shorted the share are. Why would they be unless they still had something to lose?

Also technically all trading is based upon fake numbers, and on the flipside to your argument the information you are relaying could also very well be false. With numbers not completely reliable one way or the other I'd rather focus more on the psychological warfare currently underway, as that will at least give hints as to what might be coming.

In any case, I've yet to see any compelling evidence that the squeeze has been squoze. On the other hand I have seen plenty of evidence pointing towards the squeeze still being alive, and the potential for it to reach as of yet unseen heights.

I dare you to take a look around for yourself. But even if you don't it doesn't really matter. The evidence points in one direction and I'll follow it until it points in another. Right now it says GME to $500,000+.",1,0,1615266002,Dense-Seaweed7467

36,gqar4yy,"In a vacuum youre wrong. If everyone were willing to hold until 6 figures that would happen.  Granted, reality is not a vacuum/controlled scenario and realistically many people will hop off long before that. 

The truth remains tho that the main limit is what people holding are willing to believe the main limit is. What is the point of limiting the horizon of this once in a lifetime opportunity when none of us have any idea how high it can really go, AND the longer people wait and hold the higher it gets?

There are also systems in place for this very thing. A chain of command, if you will. The lower rungs, if they are unable to pay, bump their shares to be covered higher up. Probably the lower rungs will be liquidated by higher rungs to cover costs. And so on until it hits the DTCC and the Fed.
