47,gqhqehk,"Dear Mother,

Today has been a very silly day for GME and the boys. Although the hedgies continue to attack, we only grow stronger in numbers and strength. Where the rest of the investment corps sees bloodshed, our special autist company sees great opportunity. We had previously attempted to negotiate a treaty along the 1000th trench line, but an audacious attack on our 300-400 rank members has left any chance of finding a peace slim. We now aim to push deep into enemy territory as their war of attrition wears thinner by the day. We understand the risks, but they have insulted us by taking actions that suggest they assume we think logically. 

I miss you dearly, and many of the boys here share the same sentiment. I didn't know you were such an entertainer! The whole company says hi. 

Signed,
