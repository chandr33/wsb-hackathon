9,gpia0o4,"Increases the put:call ratio. Makes it look like gme is a losing game. I believe about 100k puts are 10 and below. Probably more by now. It‚Äôs a short tactic, each one have a delta hedge as well, this way brokerages can balance out a gamma squeeze and shorts only end up spending about $1 per contract",26,0,1614752168,RagingHippo33469
10,gpib7p0,"I think you would have to know the source to begin to make sense.  Some are legit bets, others are hedging?  
  
Personally I wrote 105p today to profit on theta and I wasn't sure on the price action since yesterday turned out better than expected.   I missed out on the RKT gains but from what I can tell people expected it to pop for a long time.  Today happened to be the day.",0,0,1614753080,kyune

19,gpiw9xk,"Basically it is a different tactic to keep the stock down, by the Hedgies.

So one thing to do to keep the stock down is to just sell shares.But they have no shares.So they can borrow shares (Shorts) and sell those.But there are barely any Shorts left to borrow.So they buy puts.

Puts are the opposite of Calls, a call bets a higher price can be reached and a put bets a lower price can be reached.If the target is reached, you can buy the shares for that price that you set.

Now, in order to be able to give you the shares at that price that you set, the closer the stockprice gets to the strike price, the more shares are bought by the other side, in order to give you the shares, once it reaches that strike price (very oversimplified).So it pushes the price down a little.But here is the main kicker why the Hedgefunds do this:

If a Pro wants to analyze a stock, in regards to wether it goes up or down, they will look at the ratio between Puts and Calls.If there are more Calls than Puts, that means many people bet on the stock going up and in order to ""hedge"", there are shares bought, which drives the price up.So it looks like, and is, an attractive stock to buy, driving it further up.The HedgeFunds do not want to let that happen, so they need to stop that momentum.

In the same way, if the ratio is the same, it is assumed it might stay at a level.

If there are more puts, it looks like there is a downward trend.

Now the hedgies do not have a lot of ways left in order to push the price down, so they try to obfuscate how many Calls there are by buying a whole bunch of puts.At the same time, that may push the price down a bit.

It is unlikely, that their price target is reached, but they make it look like people have lost faith in a stock, even though it may be stronger than ever.Hedgies are getting desperate is my guess.",6,0,1614772316,Starhammer4Billion
