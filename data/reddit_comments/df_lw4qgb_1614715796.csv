9,gpgh7ek,"To be fair $60 is a fair value if we go according to history of this company. 1) RKT was around $20 at 5B revenue. If they have $15B in rev, they should now be $60. Currently, I would buy calls until above $60. And then puts if it goes tooooo high above that range.

36,gpgz49r,Okay so maybe someone can do the rest of the research for me and make a sub but since so there are so many call options out and everyone wants to receive the divedends since that has to be done before March 5th. I read that when someone excercises there call option it leads to a significant increase in price so since there are so many contracts out there. I believe the 60* Target is valid in that respects.

55,gphe8ui,Not sure if you're being serious. Really not sure why you're choosing this random comment to ask.

56,gpher3y,"I'm sorry if it is a random question. I saw that you posted your comment a few minutes ago so I decided to ask you since you're more likely to still be online.

I'm being serious, I'm new to the game and have no idea about the terms/phrases being thrown around.

OK so if I have this correctly, the other guy said he thought the news of the special dividend payments was already taken into consideration when the price jumped from 20 to 24 i.e. He thought that the 4 dollar jump was likely already aided by the news of the dividend payment?",5,0,1614734290,Recipe_988
57,gphfv32,"Ah ok. Honestly I forgot the guy above even used the term ""priced in"" so I was confused. 

Yeah, basically he was saying that he realized there was hype around the dividend idea, which is what made it go from 20 to 24, and he was assuming that's the only affect it was going to have. Then he says ""boy was I wrong"" because obviously, it seems to have had a much much much larger effect (assuming it's just the idea of the dividend and nothing else behind the scenes). 

I saw the term ""priced in"" being thrown around a lot last year with jobless claim numbers being released on certain days, vaccine news, election news, etc. For example, news could be reported that jobless claims were higher than expected and the market didn't really react because it was ""priced in."" It was kind of assumed that unemployment would rise and the magnitude didn't really matter to the larger investors.",4,0,1614734856,red-bot

Otherwise, you might think about holding until the $1B buyback.  Not sure when that is though.

Edit: No need to downvote here.  I am not against this one at all, and may jump back in late today, but I don't want to be on the wrong end of another silver, pot, etc stock.
