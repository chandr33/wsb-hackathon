I can go short all the way today, and the worst you can do to me is take a few grand and my house (not really since the house would go first to my bank and then any leftovers would go to you). 

So people hyping it up, that's fine. It might hit that rate, but even if it does. When the funds don't clear because they hit their own margin limits, well then the share price will quickly drop. Back to 5$, it should but probably not. 

The big institutions that borrow this money for people to play around on margin, well they will be hurt and so will their shareholders, but again. They are probably insured so they may hit limits and have to stop transactions, just like Robinhood. 

Economically, I suspect a lot of shares will be sold in other markets to cover money owed for these shares. And as people pile on, on both sides, you will see a general market crash. Since the none diamond holders of companies that don't have profits, well they will sell, so expect shares of Tesla, Uber, Doordash, etc, all start crashing quickly and heavily. 

The institutional investors will try moving into a safe haven. I suspect gold, since it really hasn't performed like other commodities.

Similarly, shorts can't cover super fast without mooning the price, at some point, the mark-to-market difference in the short positions will require so much capital as collateral with their clearing houses that they'll be liquidating large holdings in other securities and that will cause a severe downturn/crash in the overall market, and that's when the powers that be will shut everything down. They might have to literally close global markets for days to unwind the mess at some fixed price. There will be lawsuits, liquidity will be scarce, your money might be tied up by emergency orders from judges for a while. That's IF we get there, but I see that as happening by around 10k/share, ESPECIALLY if people are right that naked shorting has lead to 100s of percent more shares sold short than there are in existence bc of the lack of a hard locate and hold on actual shares when short positions are opened. See the total liability won't be the market cap if there's more short obligations than there are shares outstanding. The total liability will be share price x short positions. So if shorts have actually sold 500% of the float that's still like 400% of shares outstanding, meaning a 10k/share pricepoint yields about a 700B x 4 liability of 2,800B or 2.8 trillion with a T. Once you start pushing 1T liability, you're well into the ""market crash, global depression, millions and millions of lives lost, worst possible scenario given current unemployment and financial distress as we're struggling to get through the pandemic"" ... you see where that logic is going. The Gov will absolutely fuck everyone, undo millions of transactions, when the same ""smart people"" at GS who explained why they needed to bail out the banks in '09 explain that this is ""so much worse"" ... maybe they just print a bunch of money and hope it doesn't collapse the dollar. Certainly seems to have worked during the pandemic (money printing), but all that money printing was done for ""rational"" reasons, and this ""market craziness"" will be spun as ""gangs of thugs spending their government checks on market manipulation."" Just look at the media, we're not the ""good guys"" and the Joe Bidens of the world are not going to understand that it's insufficient regulation of short selling that got us here in the first place. Too much money is made on HFT for hard locating to ever be enforced, so this synthetic shorting and failure to deliver problem will continue.",15,1,1615325931,ilosemoneyz
