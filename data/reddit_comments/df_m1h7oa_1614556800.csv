second biggest error was assuming that Vol(Event 1) = Vol(Event 3), solving for amount of volume to go, and basing your PT for Friday on assuming that there's gonna be 150M shares traded PER DAY over the next 3 days.

A simulation would be the way to go to even have some accuracy, and even then, you would have a range, not a single data point as your estimate.
