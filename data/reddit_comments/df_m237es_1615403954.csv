You need to understand that these people aren't hypocritical, they are gaslighting and manipulating you.  


When the mafia decides (or did in the day anyways) to murder somebody, a hit if you will, they generally play friendly or create a situation in which the person getting whacked believed they were about to have something really good happen to them by their trusted friends up until the very moment that they died.  


Try to apply that sort of warfare to what you're referring to here. They don't even think they are having a dialogue with you in which they can be caught up being hypocritical. They are just straight up attacking your mind with words. That's all it is, an attack.
