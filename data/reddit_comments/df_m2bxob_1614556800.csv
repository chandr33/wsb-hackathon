If I was a whale, or a few whales,that wanted to start the squeeze, what do I need to overcome to get there?  Shorts maybe?  And how do I stop the shorts?  The easiest way would be to sell a bunch of stock today all at once, dump the price, and in doing so get GME onto the Short Sale Restricted list for tomorrow. Drop a FAT fucking order tomorrow morning.  Boom, squeeze initiated.  That could be why it's trading flat tonight as well.

At this point tho, the question I‚Äôm looking at is WHO was paid off here? I‚Äôm leaning toward the reporters taking a pocket bribe without telling their superiors, and selling prime access for a premium. 

Two main reasons I‚Äôm thinking that is because:
1. The marketwatch article, both of those reporters‚Äô Twitter accounts were suddenly set to private today. I‚Äôm thinking that was the company that did that, while they further investigate internally. Could be wrong and the whole organization is part of a conspiracy, but that would make things very complicated.

2. The CNBC article, if you go to that guy‚Äôs Twitter, he clearly completely forgot that his article was even published at 12:41, and he retweeted about the GME drop clearly like he never even knew the article existed.
