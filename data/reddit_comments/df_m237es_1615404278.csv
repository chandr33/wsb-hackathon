Steep incline, large selloff.  Shift in sentiment, momentum stifled.  Who facilitated the initial large selloff?  Not retail.  If retail is largely populated by apes now, what might be the objective outcome of the above scenario?  Price is correlated to sentiment.   If what we believe is the price is the price... fear mongering benefits who ever stands to gain from the price being lower.",1,0,1615404279,angstypoo

Borrow 500k shares of GME, and other longs, bundle them up with those longs, then sell the corresponding basket as 1,000,000 shares of an ETF named XRT.

You can't look at that price action for the two and not come to that conclusion.
