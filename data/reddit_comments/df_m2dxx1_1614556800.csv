3,gqikstx,"It's how much people are willing to pay and how much risk they are willing to take. Who's going to be seriously considering buying Gamestop over companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, even Chewy when Gamestop is at $1k+? People that don't know what stocks actually are.",2,0,1615424377,ChadSMASHya
4,gqikxmr,"If the market cap is currently $12.6B at $256 per share, then it would be nearly $5 trillion at $100,000 per share unless my math sucks. Apple‚Äôs market cap is $2 trillion. Amazon is $1.5 trillion. Do you think that sounds realistic?",21,0,1615424449,ohhellojones

6,gqil20p,"Theoretically, nobody‚Äôs ever posted real evidence for anything over 10k really. The rest is just euphoria. First squeeze in Jan, thousands for sure just based on momentum aligning. 

When you see someone say 100k is not a meme, ask them why. If they say Berkshire Hathaway, they‚Äôre retarded. Find your risk but do not be delusional.

10,gqilch6,Or based on the news with gamestop recently. I swear people are not seeing the bigger picture here when we say WE LIKE THE STOCK. Do you think it is just gonna be a mall retail store in the next 5-10 years? With how huge esports is growing and just the basic common fucking sense that is going on right now with the ryan cohen move.,3,0,1615424668,arteagad14
11,gqilldw,In 5-10 years you'll be able to connect to an esports game from your mom's basement. Connectivity and communications are the better plays. Gamestop is better off trying to be a middle man between producers and scalpers,-3,0,1615424801,ChadSMASHya

16,gqim1hk,Nope. The definition is that it‚Äôll spike until it‚Äôs over. The VW example was a very large company becoming very larger. No piece of evidence has ever said when this squeezes it will de facto become one of the largest for a time.,0,0,1615425038,JinnPhD
17,gqim2jv,"You already have places like ""Contender Esports"" for example, popping up everywhere. Sure, Gamestop could try, but then it comes down to actually pulling in consumers.

19,gqim97e,"This has nothing to do with market cap. The price of a stock is the one people are willing to pay to buy it. And, this is all about short squeeze. Price of a stock during the SS is NOT calculated by market cap formulae.",3,0,1615425152,myuserid4

21,gqimdls,"I‚Äôm not trying to knock people who believe in a short squeeze. That‚Äôs fine. But I seriously doubt the market price of GME effectively gives it half the market cap of gold. Besides it just being an absurd number and unpayable, even for hedge funds, I can‚Äôt imagine any hedge fund hasn‚Äôt prepared at least a little bit for this type of price action. They had a multi-week span where it was in the $40s. They aren‚Äôt going to get squeezed into oblivion. Maybe I‚Äôll be floored, but I just have serious doubts. And I don‚Äôt want people to lose their whole life savings based on poorly supported speculation.",1,0,1615425216,ohhellojones
22,gqimfw1,It may be a short term play but it's not a long term play. Idk if you are a hedgie intern or just some kid high off of tendies but you aren't helping yourself or others looking to make serious long term investments by making speculations while still high.,1,0,1615425249,ChadSMASHya
23,gqimjr5,Lol it is literally THE long play. Im good on this convo,1,0,1615425305,arteagad14
24,gqimtz1,"Right. I guess I just meant to illustrate with the highest market caps in the market that 7000 metric fuck tons of money would need to be dumped into GME shares to drive a price to $100k. Even with a short squeeze, why wouldn‚Äôt a hedge fund tap out and declare bankruptcy well before that price target? They‚Äôd surely be broke in the low thousands? I‚Äôll gladly watch the show and see how it unfolds, but I don‚Äôt think hedge funds are going to get hit the same way as the first wave. They‚Äôve had weeks to prep.",2,0,1615425454,ohhellojones

27,gqin1ut,"Personally I don‚Äôt see it capping over 20k at the highest. I‚Äôd be happy to be proven wrong as I‚Äôve been holding and adding to my position since January. Realistically I‚Äôd say anywhere between 5-10k. Institutional ownership is much high than retail and nobody wants to admit that. 

We are along for the ride and even though we have some big players ‚Äúon our side‚Äù for right now, don‚Äôt think they will hesitate to leave us as the bag holder when they decide to cash out.",4,0,1615425570,large_block
28,gqin5yz,"VW was the most valuable company in the world for a brief period during its short squeeze.

The GME situation isnt anything like the VW situation, but it just shows what is possible.

What matters with GME is the financial institutions not being able to pay out.  This happened in 2008.  The credit default swaps were worth a lot more after the crash than people were selling them for, but no one could afford to buy them for what they were worth.  So the price had to come down.",1,0,1615425628,PuWahWah9

31,gqio5ub,"I am not disagreeing with you. My point is, things may get really wild and no one can tell today, based on any formula, the price and the market cap of GME when it reaches it's peak.

Yes, HFs can declare bankruptcy but it's not that easy for a HF to do that. Looking at the client assets, loans, credits, clients contracts, lock in periods etc. I am sure they must have thought about it. But declaring chapter 11 just because they could not handle a short selling cycle for a stock that that is being traded by bunch of retards on reddit will also not look good on them IMO. So they are playing games to come up on the top at the end.

I positively feel that SS is going to happen because if HF would have had so much pull, control and winning strategies then they would used it already. They would have never let the price of the stock go 40+ after Jan 2021.",1,0,1615426144,myuserid4
