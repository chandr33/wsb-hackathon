2,gpofkrp,"For those who have still yet to switch, I started a rh-&gt;fidelity transfer on 1/23 and everything was completed on 1/26 (beware tho, in the middle of the night all my rh stocks disappeared from rh and didn't appear in fidelity till open, almost had a heart attack)

I only had (whole, not partial) stocks on rh, which probably made the process easier.

Also, as for the $75 fee for Transfer Of Account, I haven't seen it requested from rh or fidelity. Anyone experience this or already paid the fee?",8,0,1614881138,Ph0enixF0x
3,gpognvo,"Fidelity tends to pay off any fees for you (although technically, you should be phoning Fidelity first for this kind of offer). With small accounts, Fidelity might not but generally, Fidelity is a great brokerage.",5,0,1614881599,Fwellimort
4,gpohxsz,Just started but they said it would take about a week.,1,0,1614882127,philoponeria
5,gpoj3c5,I left $78 in my account to cover the fees just in case and put the rest in basic bitch stocks that aren't going anywhere.,2,0,1614882607,philoponeria
6,gpojijw,My transfer took about a week as well and the rep I called regarding linking an account was very happy to help someone who didn't yell at them. They'll go the extra mile of you treat them like humans.,4,0,1614882786,Favored_Terrain
7,gpokhvh,This is generally true of many Customer service folks. My guy said he would watch it and call me once it's done or if there were any other bumps.,6,0,1614883199,philoponeria
8,gpom2dt,I gave them a call and the rep skirted around the subject when I asked if fidelity would waive the fee for me. Was worth a shot tho.,2,0,1614883856,Ph0enixF0x
9,gpom65u,I'm hesitant to ask rh if they want me to pay them $75 because you know they'll fuck you any chance they get.,1,0,1614883900,Ph0enixF0x

11,gpot5k6,"It took a month for my transfer from RH &gt; Fidelity to complete; it finalized this week. The delays were because they didn't know what ""All"" stocks meant. I resubmitted my request with exact shares.

Some things to keep in mind. Only whole shares transfer. Any partial share gets sold off at market value and transferred as cash. Fidelity will only waive the $75 fee for transfers over $25k; so keep $75 cash available in RH to prevent delays.

Fidelity is backed up to all hell right now, so make sure you put in the request for options trading immediately, if applicable. It's been a month and a half and Fidelity has not been able to review my request yet.

I wish the best of luck to you all.

13,gpovan0,"This is incorrect. As someone who bought all her shares before upgrading to gold, then upgraded to gold while everything was still pending back in Jan before it al popped off, your shares are NOT on margin. 

Your instant deposit is on margin and they can disable your instant deposits until everything clears up. Dealt with that mess months ago.  But your shares are not on margin. 

In order to buy shares on margin, you have to enable margin buying in the menu. 

See [this here](https://i.imgur.com/ZxG92A4.jpg)

Secondly, if you upgrade to Robinhood gold, you get access to the instant $5k deposits. But those deposits are still on a margin as your money still has to come through. 

So if you deposit $6k into a RH Gold account then you get immediate access to $5k while the remaining $1k is pending.  But again, your shares bought on instant deposit are not on margin. Until you turn on margin enabled buying you aren’t buying on margin.",3,0,1614887654,Paige_Maddison

16,gppebds,"I'm curious what your statements say. I utilized the instant deposit monies and ensured there was money to pay for everything I was buying. My statement still says my account type is margin and all my shares are margin.

It was also reinforced when everything transferred to Fidelity marked as margin.
