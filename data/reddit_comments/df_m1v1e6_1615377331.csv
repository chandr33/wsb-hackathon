54,gqfqim0,"Dear Netflix. This should be the plot of the GME/WSB movie.

Cohen invests in GME. DFV invests in GME. Everybody laughs at him. The squeeze starts happening. DFV makes millions and secures money while diamond holding GME after (the plot twist) ROBINHOOD blocks people from buying GME. Squeeze goes down, is heavily shorted again.  People are being laughed at. DFV doubles his position. MOASS happens. The good guys win. TADA.

But Im  a gay bear so it should continue as follows: MOASS happens. People are millionaires. But some people still hold and when DFV sells they call him a paper bitch although they only know about GME and trading for a month now. While many make large sums, many still hold and yell 10 WORLD GDP is not a meme. This was not the real squeeze. Melvin has covered. Many will baghold. Many will sue DFV although he never gave any financial advice. He wins in court but one salty bagholder picks him off with a sniper. DFV is remembered dearly. Shooter dies in a shootout. People start idolizing DFV as their messiah. 

P.S. I just like this movie idea. I dont want DFV to die.",1,0,1615377433,magorianworld
