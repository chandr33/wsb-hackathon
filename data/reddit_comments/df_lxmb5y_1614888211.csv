8,gpp1wgp,"Wow, this has a lot going for it - grand slam potential here.  I've watched this stock for a few years now and think I might be convinced to finally pull the trigger on it.

1) Growth: Obvious deal with Amazon / Whole Foods extending a business they've been running for a long while now.

2) Value: This company historically prints cash, their losses in the last year or so were due to one time restructuring write offs after merging with the SuperValue chain.  

3) Inflation: commodity, and especially more high end foods (think about the sort of person who buys from Whole Foods - they're doing great in this market and will continue to as long as the feed is keeping rates low, which it looks like they will)

4) Short opportunity?  I think there is a lot of price suppression going on with this stock, particularly as retaliation from the big investment banks because *they had the balls to sue Goldman Sachs* when their bonds for SuperValue ended up being priced too low.  Currently 13% of float on loan.

I have no positions yet, looking to add a few calls but mostly shares as this looks like a long term play to me.",33,0,1614890445,jaycrft
