So what if teenagers  grow out of it and move on, they‚Äôll be replaced with new kids , it‚Äôs not like new kids aren‚Äôt born every day . Plus when the current players grow up and have kids of their own they‚Äôll have that nostalgia factor , similar to GME right now.

The kids aren‚Äôt all begging for money, they‚Äôre doing chores and be rewarded for good grades . Xmas , Bday, and Holidays they all want one thing Robucks , and there are 150 Million users !!!

My parents dismissed video games as a fad when I was I kid .  I‚Äôve learned that you can make a ton of money investing in what interests the kids . It seems the the millennials on here are having a very boomerish opinion on what the next generation is into.",1,0,1615463776,Rahawk02
