6,gqkbhhy,"No they're coming after both sides when they inevitably lose because it exposes naked shorting. Naked shorting ""is"" illegal but isn't (because it's not enforced). It requires margin, ALOT of margin and only an mm can do it. The level of margin they're using now must be on system collapse levels, I mean this is getting absolutely reckless. The hubris of these guys fuck. The only way they're still keeping this down and playing this game is if they have a thumbs up from the fed. Promises based on promises based on promises. Once you accept they're naked shorting, you realize they quite literally can control *ahem* ""make"" the markets, how many shares yah need? 1m? 2m? 50m? Fuck it the shares aren't real neither are the dollars. I suppose that's why the market always seems to drift to the max pain equilibrium on Fridays (most of the time). This is not a free market you're playing with, they've shown that to us over and over. The one thing that terrifies them is when cohen calls for the shares and they do a recount. I have some faith in institutions like the sec. Come on Gensler, they're trapped. You know it. We know it. Soon the world will know it. I believe they'll use this to clean up the game and make it more fair. I also think they're going to use this to tax the hell out of retail traders. And thirdly I believe they will disallow retail to buy/sell options. Hence the forbes article(s). You think a bunch of retail holding 5 shares are buying deep DEEP in the money calls? It's a trap by the bullish whales, it gives citadel the liquidity they need to fight today, but is a ticking time bomb when these guys spending millions on options exersize them later. But the more they try to fuck us young guys, the more we'll realize there are alternatives, and they lose their monopoly on promises, it's a hell of a tough spot the people at the top are in right now and I feel for them, but game stop and us for that matter will not go silently into the night. In this game you vote with your dollars, are you willing to risk everything to clean up the game? I sure as fuck am.",1,0,1615463765,dajcoder

21,gqkgbbq,"Stock goes up over the course of a month or two. “This was a coordinated attack by a redit page”. Stock drops 40% in 20 fucking minutes “oh that’s just the market correcting itself it’s a free market”. Here’s the rub everyone on this sub is out for themselves. We all hope we all succeed but at the end of the day if I walk away at the peek and someone buys at the peak and sells at the bottom we’re both posting shit and this sub congratulates us both. Most “numbers” floating around there’s a spectrum of users thinking between “that’s the exact number I want” and “that’s a retarded number and they’re gonna be holding the bag” we buy at the time that suits us “hopefully” best as each individual investor and sell at the price that “hopefully” suits each individual the best. You may see spikes from “hype” of a guy eating crayons or drinking Pee or announcing he’s not a cat. Put that on an official document saying you think constitutes as coordination on the record and look how fucking retarded you sound. “Uhhh were launching this investigation cause this guys not a cat and this guy munched down on a broccoli stem green Crayola and we think they manipulated the free market” you might as well be sipping a cup of your own piss while you said that because you couldn’t look anymore retarded and you like the taste and it’s sterile. 

But sure let’s not mention that the stock dropped from 340 to 198 in the matter of 20 fucking minutes. Sure some of that was margin calls and stop losses but chances are if you were paying attention to the stock and had a stop loss or got margin called you have a free stock and $134 worth of GameStop in your Robinhood. You want to know where the manipulation is? You want to know who’s coordinated and as a collective group is working as an individual entity being able to manipulate a stocks value by 40% in 20 fucking minutes?

28,gqkjhxu,"Thank you. To add, I don't just like the stock and I believe most of us here go beyond liking the stock too. Gamestop has a bright future ahead of it in the e-commerce and e-sports space, especially with Ryan Cohen taking the helm soon.

Yes, we're a rowdy bunch. We're not always PC. We shitpost and bullshit while trading and working our day jobs. We like the memes and joking around! But the true members of the community support each other through losses and while we bitch at paper hands out loud, we're also happy when others come out ahead in their trades. We don't wish ill on anyone or their trades.

Participation in the stock market doesn't need to change for the retail investor, aside from maybe relaxing some restrictions. Yes, it's easier to trade than ever before, but brokerages should make the risks more clear, and the manipulative activity by hedge funds and other institutional investors is what needs to be investigated. We don't need a 21 age gate on investing, we're adults at 18. If I have to sign up for selective service at 18 then as an 18 year old I should be able invest in the company I believe in.

The stock market is not a casino, but day trading and swing trading are real strategies that the SEC accepts and the outcome can be riskier than long term investing. Retail investors understand this and don't need any government handholding here. We know it's not free money and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. What seems tk have happened recently is that for once the institutional investor was caught on a major downside of the inherent risk in the market, and it seems to much of the focus here is to ""prevent this from happening again"". Well, they understood the risks of shorting a stock by 140%. Why is the government involved only after a hedge fund loses? And will the bad actors Melvin, Citadel, and Robinhood receive a proportional fine to the tune of the money saved? Today SEC fines are just a ""cost of doing business"" to the institutional investor and this in my opinion is what needs to be solved, not the participation of the retail investor. 

Much of this investigation has (from what I've read and listened to) centered around age gating trading to 21 and regulating communities like ours. During the senate hearing yesterday it was even suggested to put investment learning materials and any kind of due diligence behind a ""high value"" pay wall. This is not the way. The stock market was hard for the retail investor to get into until recently and we shouldn't regress into how retail trading worked even just a few years ago.

Yesterday's senate committee heard at least one opinion that trading ""should not be done through an app on your phone"". Well, why not? I can finance a car through several apps. I can do my general banking through my banks apps and even apply for various loans. I can buy a house through an app. I can order food or other goods through an app. I can hail a ride or get paid to give someone a ride through an app or even decide on a whim I want to deliver food fod a few hours. I can even accept credit card payments through an app. There is no reason why investing can't be done through advancing technology like our ever-evolving personal devices, and considering a baseless restriction like this shows that committee or its experts may be out of touch with not only the modern retail investor, but the modern citizen in general.

I could go on but I have to get my kid ready for school, and get ready for work. But I hope someone from the House, Senate, or SEC reads this. We are not a bunch of ""absolute mongs"" nor do we disparage the differently abled. We are a quirky community with a different vernacular who supports each other in the stocks we like and through the inevitable loss all investors experience at least once.
