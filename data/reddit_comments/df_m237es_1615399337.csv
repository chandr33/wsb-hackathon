My question is, right now if you wanted to capitalize: 

I buy to open, select call as my position. What would you set your date and strike price at? And must you own a bunch of gme to do this to make a profit? What‚Äôs the risk in doing something like this, is it just the loss of whatever you paid for the call and that‚Äôs it?

I know these questions are rudimentary but I appreciate any knowledge anyone wants to pass on. Good luck with this guys I hope you all become millionaires off these fucking hedgefunds pricks.",2,0,1615399344,st00d5
