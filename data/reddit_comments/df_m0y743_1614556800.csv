2,gqazreb,"I do agree that ""investment"" for reactionary politics of related events is foolish, or 'on brand' for a true retard.

That said lets say that given market environments Apple starts selling so much product they slaughter evwry single projection, quarter after quarter, their fundies are on fire and they have massive cash on hand literally burning holes in their pockets. They start buying up smaller competitors in the midst of this fire storm, when their competitors could be making bank on the scraps. Not only that, their fan base promises to buy every single IPhone accessory, no matter the price for the next fee years.

You would buy shares right?

Thats why I think there is a very important distinction to be understood here. Certainly anyone running into firearm related stonks at the first hint of legislation, shootings gun control is real smooth brained, no doubt. When it comes to a company like VSTO, I remain quite bullish because there is an environment surrounding it that strengthens a growing financial foundation.

Understand that such a company isn't fundementally strong because of gun control sentiment, its steong because they have literally capitalized on ehat they recognize is a very temporary environment. If the next admin is all Red certainly that sentiment disappears, what is different here is that they have basically captured the majority of the ammo market by purchasing other competitors in the same space. 

They literally have set themselves up for an environment in which gun control isn't part of the dialogue. They have reduced debt and significantly increased revenue. They smartly decided that they would also be raising prices April 1st this year. Did they need to? Absolutely not according to past quarter earnings, but they aren't focused on these surges in droves of emotional comprised foolish ammo hoarders. They understand they must prepare for lower sales and they have postured themselves to do so.

TL:DR yes investing in momentary reactionary politics of anyone is a quick way to lose a buck, but specially for VSTO, there is much more than politics in play. Look at their fundementals and their recent actions to understand why that is the case. In the end its always been about money, not politics.",1,0,1615274667,Siceless

4,gqbpo0u,"With Vista, yes, there's good potential right now purely because they're expanding into a market which recently experienced the loss of a major player. But, if the patterns above hold, they're unlikely to benefit at all from any momentary surge in buyers as a result of the threat of legislation. If anything, it'll be the same as it usually is, a momentary hiccup before resuming the same or slightly less upward trend than before. This can be seen in the final graphs where Vista was the only one of the three to have an upward trend at all after the issue with the ATF going after pistol braces cratered the growth the market was seeing.   


The point here is to solidly disprove the notion that the value of stocks in gun companies will for some reason soar any time there's a surge in buyers related to legislation, whether it's passed, threatened, or merely speculated.",1,0,1615296653,Redtail_Defense
5,gqby6zj,"I would for sure agree with that. The earnings multipler of surging sales doesn't translate into high stock prices in the short term, it takes a good long while for the numbers to pull in investors. Long term if those days are being reinvested by the company well it is a good indicator for the 1-5 year outlook. 

For those reasons I wouldn't recommend anyone invest into Smith and Wesson looking at the long term. Its feast for them now, but they haven't seemed to be reinvesting into expansion of their brand much. If anything they just appear to be reducing debt, which is good, but IMO not going to protect them longer term since their momentary higher sales literally aren't tied much to anything tangible they're currently doing.",1,0,1615301034,Siceless

7,gqfypfb,"Not for the same reason though. The trend was already happening that day well before anything violent happened.   
Even if someone managed to catch it right at 1PM, literally minutes after the rioting started, they would have missed the bulk of the upswing, and then within two days, everything they made would be gone.",1,0,1615383004,Redtail_Defense
