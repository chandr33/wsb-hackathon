Make sure you also sell when the stock over extends on this same chart and you should be good locking in profits. Wait for it to drop a few days a few days after the high and then go back in. This way you can ride the waves.

Stocks always pull back after a run, so wait for the dip and be patient. Also place a stop loss at you purchase price so you get triggered if it drops below your initial price.

If you have a long term investment (more that 1 yr) just buy the dip and hold for a year+
