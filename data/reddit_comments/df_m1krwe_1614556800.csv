2,gqe7rwd,lmao you forgot to mention net revenue of largely negative with it's largest increase at 31 mill in the last 10 years lmao. with a share holders equity of 1.6B even at 3B its seriously over valued...,1,0,1615337390,blakes5353
3,gqe80ov,Net revenue negative? I’d go back and read the 10-k because that’s incorrect. And also the diagnostic division only joined OPK 6 years ago and is their largest profit provider so it’s a completely different company from ten years ago,0,0,1615337521,idiotmike69

7,gqe8zuv,"I thought you were stating net revenue was negative in fiscal year 2020. I did mention in my post that 2020 was first profitable year for $OPK so going back to your original comment, I did not forget to mention that $OPK was operating at a loss prior to this past year",1,0,1615338040,idiotmike69
8,gqe93te,Need to read into him more...wrote many books on weed/pear control...how does that tie into OPK?  If the chart repeats I’ll buy some cheap options in about two weeks for the shits of it.,3,0,1615338099,wagman551
9,gqe9kae,"Yeah but you said “1.44B in revenue” and that’s it. 

You’re clearly just not mentioning the net revenue while mentioning a revenue to make it sound like they made all this money when they didn’t at all. Which is some BS",1,0,1615338344,blakes5353
10,gqe9vzj,I don’t know how familiar with accounting terms but revenue is the top line item of an income statement. I didn’t think anyone would confuse revenue with profit (net revenue) but I am glad you pointed this out. I will try and be more deliberate with my DD posts next time,1,0,1615338514,idiotmike69
11,gqe9z4s,I was using top line revenue to point out how low of a multiple their market cap is to their revenue,1,0,1615338562,idiotmike69

15,gqeai0s,Haha to go back to the original question I don’t know how that ties into $OPK but Frost is an MD so he probably has written many medical journal entries,1,0,1615338844,idiotmike69
