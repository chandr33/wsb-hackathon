10,gqhzuwj,Look at all the news today when you open the app. Any article that mentions GME doesn’t show its ticker or its gains. 🤔,2,0,1615413779,Colt45W

13,gqi042e,"I’ve noticed you need to close the app and re-open to refresh Volume stats, can’t corroborate your experience.  I think they updated the way users sync database information.  I don’t think misleading volume statistics is in any way trying to manipulate you.
If you don’t like the app, go elsewhere.
To my knowledge no other brokerage is going to give you the flexibility they do.  Instant spending on trades is huge, who wants to wait days for funds to settle after selling a stock.
I also kindof understand the need to place restrictions, it was unprecedented, and the majority of us retailers using Robinhood day trading like fools.  All that cash needs to be floated until it settles... no one has that kindof liquidity.",1,0,1615413894,riskrunner10
