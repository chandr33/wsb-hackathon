45,gqga5v5,You bought GME at 10? Don’t get down on yourself. You made gains. That’s all you can really hope for. No one knew what would happen and you got out making a nice profit. I sold in the 90s when I bought at 86.99. And right after that is when it rallied (and still is). I sold at the absolute worst time possible. I still made money so I’m not going to beat myself up too much about it.,1,0,1615388786,InSixFour
