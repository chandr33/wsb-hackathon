0,gqectju,"It’s been that way since the beginning of the 20th century (longer maybe, idk). Everyone and their mom traded on margin and the market only went up. Till it didn’t. Not saying there’ll be a decimation of the market; I think we’re due for a correction soon enough.

I am concerned about my friends’ financial decisions though. I threw a small chunk of my money at GME fully ready to lose it, but I got a buddy who’s exclusively dealing in memes and alternative currencies.",1,0,1615340085,AlmondBoyOfSJ

Usually, winter is a slow time of year and it gives the suppliers a chance to make the engineered materials but now they aren't getting time to get ahead. Some fuck ups in Texas with resin production is contributing as well.

A few companies are traded. Some are WY, BCC, XME, PICK, WOOD, LPX.

Lumber also got greedy as fuck last year and raised their prices anticipating a recession which never happened with never touched them and then there were some issues with the forest fires in California ruining equipment. They also just thought fuck it, we'll keep the prices high because the demand is so high.
