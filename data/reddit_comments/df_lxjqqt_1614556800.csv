34,gpnf4o7,"Okay, I like this because I've been looking at this too. GME and AMC available shares to borrow vs SI% are extremely telling looking at the 3 month graph. 

You basically see a huge level of SI%, a almost non existent level of shares to borrow and then you see the squeezes of both. After the squeeze, the SI% PLUMMETS to nothing and the available shares to borrow SKY ROCKET.

RKT is not looking like that yet. The SI% is extremely high still and the available shares to borrow is extremely low. We are still in for a squeeze.",26,1,1614864517,Altnob

49,gpngn7k,"One company is the leader in their industry, insanely profitable and with nothing but positive outlooks, and the other is GME, with a bunch of bloat and needing to pivot to stay relevant and even then, most gamers once they have their system will just be buying games from the game system's online marketplace. Their current business model is dying similar to AMC's. Maybe Cohen will change things and save them, and even then doing everything right moving forward, they MIGHT be worth what their current price is.

GME's short situation may be different, but you can't possibly say the current price isn't laughable for it. It's an absolute lotto play for a mega short squeeze while RKT should actually be worth tons more than it currently is.",6,0,1614865358,SunriseSurprise

64,gpnj15l,"If you look at GME and AMC's charts you can see there was a dip in SI% in both just before the spike. It's my conclusion smaller HFs covered at these points to get out ahead of the storm which spiked an increase in price leading to the momentum everyone needed to hop on.

Using that, I like to conclude that the massive spike in RKT's price on Tuesday was the same thing. Only some shorts were covered leading to a spike in price and the momentum everyone needed to jump on. 

Now we just have to show the rest of the shorts we're here to stay.

I currently hold no positions on RKT but I read some solid DD about a month ago and had a few calls. I sold Tuesday. I'm debating getting back in but not exactly sure what to do.

forgot about my 3/5 positions (they're like -800$ right now kind of wrote them off) added to the post below.",4,0,1614866618,Altnob

69,gpnkkhi,"Lets talk about the option chain for a moment.

On Tuesday it was capped at 36$ with about a 8$ cost so a b/e of 42$ on 36$ calls. Shorts had to hedge calls based on the call options which capped at 36 making the price close around 42$ (starting to make sense?)

Now that the option chain was increased to 60$ and the call volume for 36/40/50&amp;60 is there they've to hedge against 40-60$ calls which will push the price up further. 40$ calls hold the most O/I the B/E on 40$ calls should be around 52$ at this time. 

If the momentum gathers we could definitely see 60+ EOW as everyone jumps on this. 

Plus, the fib is bouncing right at the 61.8% mark (28$) if we add the fib extension to that mark it brings us to a 67-70$ PT EOW.

This is exciting. I have a 45$ &amp; 50$ 3/5 call thinking about adding some lower calls if the price rockets at opening. I think today is the day. As far as I'm concerned, validating my belief of this price increase will be a win for me.
