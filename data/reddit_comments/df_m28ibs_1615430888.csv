 1.) Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot 📄 🙌🏻 for you?

27,gqj0e1l,"I set a stop loss sell for 290. It was hovering between 330 and 340. I knew it wouldn't hit the stop loss unless there was some major market manipulation that happened and explicitly said so. It wasn't going to fluctuate below 297 or so at worst. It was cruising up. 

Then BAM. Of course some bullshit blatant market manipulation hits causing a 42% drop in a day of super gains with a 20 minute period. Not only did it trigger the stop loss, which I didn't think would even trigger unless something blatantly manipulative would happen, but instead of selling at 290, where it was supposed to sell at market price after dropping below the threshold. It sells at 264. Not cool. Still don't know what even happened. Who has the power to nearly single handedly tank a massively traded stock nearly 50% in 20 minutes?
