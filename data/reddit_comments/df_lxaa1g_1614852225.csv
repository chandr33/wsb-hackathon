29,gpnf06b,"have you not noticed the HUGE rotation from growth stocks into value/dividend stocks the past few weeks? Well that is EXACTLY what is happening and it was expected. Under a Trump administration, growth stocks thrive. Under a Biden administration, Value/dividend stocks thrive.

This whole year most dividend stocks DIDN'T MOVE IN STOCK PRICE. They are truly an undervalued sector you'll rotations into this month. While your growth stocks are red, value will be green.
