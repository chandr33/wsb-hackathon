$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! 

I have been watching 🤓 the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. 🧐

How will 💩 shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.

1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.

2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. 

Well you heard of interstellar 🪀 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.

How does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. 

The theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud 🥔 how do they do that? Well.. 

Most people are getting a $1400 💰 check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. 

Effectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? 

You first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. 

Now how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.

Queue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. 

FOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. 

Considering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. 
If you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.

Im no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. 

Shitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.

JDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.

Tl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? 

Gamestop, VXX, and puts on “insert favorite boomer stock here” or SPY.

The transfer went through to my fidelity account and included those shares I already sold. Robinhood was showing I had the cash from selling those stocks available so I bought more GME than the cash I actually had so they sold a portion of my shares to cover that. Why would they even allow me to spend the cash if I didn’t truly have it in my account? They shouldn’t be allowed to close on my behalf at a loss, especially when the stocks rising. I could see if they just reversed it and I didn’t take a loss but for them to pull the money and fuck me over seems crazy to me.",1,0,1614702075,Hootananie
