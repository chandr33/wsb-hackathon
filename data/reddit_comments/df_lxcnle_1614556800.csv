10,gpmduy4,Why wouldn‚Äôt you do TLT instead?,3,0,1614834092,Brandowafflz
11,gpmeafh,TLT targets 20+ year treasuries. I just happen to know that everyone is freaking out about the 10 year - if you expect 20 year to get YCCed then TLT will be great.,4,0,1614834370,thehivemind5
12,gpmec38,"You are right, OI is really high. Your thesis sound good, will look into it tomorrow morning. It's a least worth a shot. Played TLT with some success this summer, fundamental plays can be steady gainers",1,0,1614834400,cravingcarrot
13,gpmes5x,Thanks for the DD! Great point about the super low IV for these options. I think I'm gonna play a straddle on this with OTM calls and puts so I can take advantage of volatile movement either way,1,0,1614834689,_reeses_feces

22,gpmk8un,"Great DD but why are you thinking JPOW will/can do anything to curb the yield bump? The market is pricing in inflation. And JPOW can‚Äôt raise rates to signal that he‚Äôs going to do anything about inflation because he can‚Äôt. 

I think JPOW is running out of ink. If he stops printing and increases rates it‚Äôll collapse the market. If he doesn‚Äôt, yields are going to go up because people will inevitably price in inflation. 

So what exactly do you the FED can do to send yields lower right now?",6,0,1614838532,MultifactorialAge
