3,gqet71y,"Back to this point.  Check my post history for my thoughts on apes vs non-apes.  The major issue has always been the fact-denying, conspiracy theory dependent tomes apes wrote that had no basis in reality.  There was a short squeeze.  It happened.  People lost money because they didn‚Äôt listen and got caught up in the hype, and then robinhood et al shut down buying to let shorts cover.  People and thought it wasn‚Äôt fair, and made up reasons that they were cheated, and then spent the next month moving the goalposts on why it would go back up.  In the end they were dependent on DFV buying more and some unknown entity, perhaps GameStop corporate buying an enormous amount of shares following the CFO getting fired.  These weren‚Äôt events the apes promised would occur, lol.  They just worked in their favor.  I can tell you with complete sincerity, all us non-apes were happy people were making money, but the obvious side effect is this subreddit is forever changed.  It‚Äôs not going back.  That‚Äôs the part where we are struggling to accept reality, for our own part.  It sucks.",1,0,1615349206,OlyBomaye
