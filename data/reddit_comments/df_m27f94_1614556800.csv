You haven't lost anything unless you sell. The value will recover, and quickly. We're likely to close higher today, despite the fuckery.  

If needed, take a break and come back in a few days. We'll still be here! Gamma squeeze is unlikely to happen before the changes on short collateral goes live on 3/19.",2,0,1615407866,Magnus56
