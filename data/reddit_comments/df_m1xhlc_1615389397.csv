3,gqgbjej,"keep working hard and spend your drinking or gaming or vice money one long smart picks that you seriously leave for a year at least while you are new...your capital gains tax rate drops dramatically after you hold an asset for a year.

You're also more likely to make impulsive mistakes early, and drop something that you had smart thoughts about just because it moves in a crappy way for a month or so.

There is a LOT to learn. Check out the investing subreddits too because understanding fundamentals and things like price/earnings are important for future plays so that you aren't caught in a bad wave. You will also play a lot of cards wrong. It's the nature of gambling.

Good luck...I'm just another shmuck, so get real advice from good people and temper it with your own angle on what is true and gonna be the future as well.

Mainly just keep working for that money to invest while you can, and work good and hard so you can ask for regular raises and don't ever get complacent or stick with a company just because it is the rut.

Keep learning new skills too.

Also some non-profit dental places exist that do certain work for free once a week or two, and some non-profit hospitals do forgiveness if your income is below like 200%-300% poverty level. Look that stuff up because my teeth are like the roman colisseum and it would have been nice to know 15 years ago. Make sure you find it in print and do whatever else to verify...I'm not qualified to teach you the details.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm at it, you can relieve tension headaches if you learn how to tell your muscles to relax completely and apply that to the places in your scalp and neck where things get tense. I practiced first by letting my breath go lax while dropping my arm over a pillow. You have to do it without any hesitation of fearing the impact which is why the pillow. Also the old let it go while dropping shoulder tension.

But one day I kept getting these headaches and was like ""WTF, these are my damn muscles and I know there is a way to tell them to cut it out!"", so I started working on it and you have to apply that release command to anywhere you can on your head. It helps to work up your neck or if you can flex your scalp, go multiple layers into releasing those muscles.

It is hard, because your natural command is to tell them to clench, so every time you make contact at first is sending a clench signal instead of a release one, and the release is like saying nothing or a negative non-message.

Also if you notice a funny feeling in the sinuses or top back of your mouth that is your prewarning to a cold, spit every bit of stuff out before it reaches your throat, and sleep with your head over the bed edge spitting into a bucket or something. I fill it with paper towels so it's less nasty. Also drink loads of hot fluid and take hot showers to give you a pretend fever boost. If you take it seriously on day 0, you can avoid your throat ever getting messed up.

Hope you have a good life.
