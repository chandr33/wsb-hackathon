0,gqfrg90,"New rule enforced? Did you read the same thing anyone else did. It‚Äôs a PROPOSED guideline and they are getting feedback first.  Then if it passes the review and feedback the guideline goes live in whatever amended form it takes. 

The rule doesn‚Äôt change anything for the big boys since they can still roll things and have more credit / liquidity than you",1,0,1615378164,Tyr312

12,gqfs5z4,"I kind of don‚Äôt understand it but here‚Äôs from what I can gather. Essentially AMC is shorted because hedges thought they were gonna eat shit due to covid, there‚Äôs more shares shorted than exist which is similar to the GME Situation. Hedges borrowed shares and loaned them to other people for shorting, but now all the shares are going to be called back to their owners due to a stock holders meeting, which could cause a short squeeze. Something along those lines",1,0,1615378690,Little_Tony_Danza
