2,gph6rwm,Ummm as someone who bought into gme at 250 on the way back down I'd suggest you look at three fundamentals and see if you think it justifies the price. Rule #1 dont invest what you're not comfortable losing.,2,0,1614730175,ResponsibleNinja56

4,gph72ri,"If it dips to $35 or less I would say go for it. I think it will hold $40ish till March 9th and the special dividend is awarded.

I wouldn't buy in $40+ as you might make a marginal profit at best. Also, a $1.11 per share dividend is not worth risking ""bag holding"" over. 

It could go to $100... personally I think most of the shorts covered today.",1,0,1614730327,sadus671
5,gph7rnk,"This will not spike as high as GME did..  imo. 

Is there still a window? Honestly don't know.. I knew that Monday morning was my window got in on a call for 20 bucks and it's riding at 3500% right now. 

Also bought a couple stonks too for the long play to build on after this event.. mini squeeze... Hedge trimming.. whatever you want to call it. 

This company investment wise for at least a year I don't think is a bad play considering interest is still really low for the next year. The company has good fundamentals.. of course do your own dd on it. 

Call wise.. not sure .. prices are all really steep.. my long shot 50 call  for 3/19 on Monday was .20 or twenty bucks for the premium... Now that same premium is around 750 for one call. I'm only 10 otm on only my second day of this contract.. if this stock goes past 50 it'll gain some real legs and possibly hit as much as a hundred. But that's a big fuckin IF. I could get clobbered tomorrow and be out 700 bucks.. well really 20 I paid for the premium.. but if this does keep it's legs to 100 I'll be making literally thousands off of 20 bucks! God I love this game.. win or lose",1,0,1614730682,Tonemarley23
