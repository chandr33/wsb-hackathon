I personally like stocks exposed to the airline industry at the moment (not necessarily airlines) as I believe they will have a good year of recovery after being beaten down due to covid.

72,gqernmu,"Hosting egaming leagues + selling hardware and software both in stores and online is a lot of potential.

The league sets peons all across the map. Just like parents pay for their kids to play in hockey leagues,  theyll pay for their introvert kids to be new option for gamers to mix social interactions with gaming. They will love to go to their weekly matchup against the other local teams or play against rivals, then scaling up the brackets to national level. Put that on a massive scale with multiple games and leagues all hosted by gme, who now also sells your hardware for your home gaming needs, and can partner up with many brands, you have already a killer combo. The league itself would generate a lot of subscription revenues as providing visibility and catching interest. When enough kids in school talk about it, itll snowball. Then gme have customers coming in stores on regular basis. They are streaming the events which is a lot of advertising and partnership potential. They can push their ecommerce platform through it, doubles the potential. They can even put some incentives for people to join the league, like offering a discount on products for people in the league, which will make people join and boost their sales. 

I really think you underestimate the turnaround potential they have.",1,0,1615348271,jfwelll
