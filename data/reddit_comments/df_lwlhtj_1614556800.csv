Novavax? No problem. Ceo qouted as ""its a problem we are built for""
Nvax isnt the only one built well for variants
But we need multiple companies to meet demand. And most the well suited for adaption variant vaccines seem to be smaller companies. Nvax despite its smallness is projected to manufacture 150 million doses a month.
Anyone saying novavax is gonna own the vaccine market is a pumper. Anyone saying the markets full is a short. Theres room for alot. And novavax is next.
