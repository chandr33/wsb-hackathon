3,gqd2k31,"We'll say APHA (around 16$ cost basis), Premium for a 1$ covered call for Jan 2023 is 16.80 (1680$), which profits me a net total of around 180 bucks, which is a super limited upside. Tbf I'd make the same money if not more if the price jumped 2 $ (which it will, so maybe APHA is a bad example.) 

I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to profit off of options and curious as to how one manages to make conservative but pretty much guaranteed gains out of it.",3,0,1615317865,Paladinspector

11,gqd3ehl,"A pretty basic options strategy is to sell OTM short to medium term covered calls. You're likely to just keep the premium, but even if the stock moons and your shares get called away, you'll still make decent money.

21,gqd46ds,"To continue using APHA as an example:

I have APHA at $14/share, I sold $30 strike October calls for $4.40/share, so I get $440 per contract premium, and also a good profit that I'd be happy with if they get exercised. Also if they don't get exercised, its a stock that I also don't mind having/holding at the expiry time either. 

Sure your way might be ""forsure profit"" but the profit is so limited that the time spent on it wouldn't make any sense. Doing OTM calls could be seen as essentially reducing your cost basis of your shares if they don't get exercised, but also taking nice profits if they do get exercised.",2,0,1615318596,The_Moisturizer

54,gqd6nf8,"Aye, selling a covered call OTM has the chance of making me money on the premium AND selling for a desirable price that makes me some profit.

55,gqd6p4p,Yeah except those calls are going to always cost more than your earnings on the stock because of the time value and you are selling ITM calls. So you would spend more to buy back the calls than it’s worth...,1,0,1615319731,rayjensen
56,gqd6vjo,would selling a Deep ITM call count as a 'loss' for capital gains on the actual sale of the stonk?

57,gqd7b1l,Yes you’re right. But again you would be buying back the calls since you would want to hold the shares assuming it still has great runway ahead. But yes the price would be a great loss.,1,0,1615319999,Satoujune
58,gqd80ab,[removed],1,0,1615320315,[deleted]
59,gqd8u08,"Ok let me see if I can break it down for you.  The reason. You don't sell long term itm covered calls is because you are forcing yourself to hold an asset for the duration of your covered call and have no upside potential.

As an example you have a $100 stock and you sell a $100 call with a 2 year expiration for $10.00.  you just made $1,000 great right?  Wrong what you are getting is $110 per share in 2 years.  So if that stock ever goes above $110 you just lost all of that growth.  So if your stock was at $150 in 2 years instead of making $5,000 you are still stuck with only $1,000.

The other issue is the capital you are keeping locked in that investment for 2 years with no flexibility to reallocate it else where.

Using the previous example with the $100 stock you have $10,000 just sitting there for 2 years.  You have no ability to use that to make anymore money since you have already collected your max profit of $1,000.  So if another opportunity comes along you miss it because your assets are locked.  If you want to be successful you need to have fluid assets that you can get into and out of quick to react to whatever is happening in the market..

If you are going to sell covered calls personally I would recommend 1 month out, 2 at the most and to sell calls that are st or just past the expected move for that time frame.  That way you are keeping your assets semi liquid while reducing you cost each month which increases your potential to make a profit and provide some downside protection.

So with the $100 stock if the expected 30 day move is +-$8 sell the $110 call for maybe $.75.  now $75 isn't as sexy as $1,000 however if you are able to keep that average for 2 years it is $1,800 instead of $1,000.  Also you are only locking your position for a month at a time and readjusting you call price each month so you aren't limiting your upside unless the stock goes beyond the expected move in any given month. So if after 2 years the stock is at $150 and you sell your net gain for the two years is $6,800 instead of $1,000.",2,0,1615320689,Mangy-Panda
