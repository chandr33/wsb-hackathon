90,gqh3tcu,"Understanding Max Pain
According to the maximum pain theory, the price of an underlying stock tends to gravitate towards its ""maximum pain strike price""â€”the price where the greatest number of options (in dollar value) will expire worthless.

Maximum pain theory says that the option writers will hedge the contracts they have written. In the case of the market maker, the hedging is done to remain neutral in the stock. Consider the market maker's position if they must write an option contract without wanting a position in the stock.

As the option expiration approaches, option writers will try to buy or sell shares of stock to drive the price toward a closing price that is profitable for them, or at least to hedge their payouts to option holders. Call writers sell shares to drive share price down and put holders buy shares to drive share price up. The max pain strike price exists somewhere in the middle.",2,0,1615400248,glitterpile12
