I honestly couldn’t care less/more (depending on if you butcher the English language or not) about Johnny Come Latelies whining about other stocks being a distraction.  It’d be so fucking boring to just stare at GME all day praying that it’ll squeeze.

32,gpjzhxm,"I know correlation does not equal causation, but 34-35 days ago was when we started seeing RKT.  That would be January 28-29.  Significant dates.  And then you have the CNBC Emoji montage while playing Rocketman this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, people have posted gains and others have claimed gains, but that is like people in 2005 making a profit off of flipping houses and trying to sell the same idea to someone in 2007.  

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, I am happy for people that got gains, but I do find it suspect.

Is it undervalued?  Yes it is.  Is it way undervalued?  Yes it is.  IMO it should be 80-100 per.

People are all over the place for why they are hoping in though.  You have FOMO, which really not close to what we saw before.  They are not a struggling Brick and Mortar.  You have people that are shouting it will go over 1k.  You have people that are saying they are just in it for the Dividend.  

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy a good ride up, but realistically people should invest with caution and people should not be blatantly be telling people that this is the last time you will see the price under a specific price.  This is a casino and everyone is out for themselves, but even the Casino will step in if things look suspect.

Now, if rocket was treading like this a year and a half down the road, I would look at it differently, not now though 6 months out of their IPO.
