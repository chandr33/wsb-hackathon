19,gqg1ja0,"This made me tear up. I'm currently living with my pops after going through one of the most difficult years of my life. I watched him hospitalized in 2005 and 2008- the first time after being laid off from his company of 30 years, the second time after being laid off from the shop he spent almost 3 years searching for. I was in college around this time and didn't realize that he was sacrificing his 401k for my and my brother's tuition.   
In the last year, after suffering from a few ischemic strokes and undergoing heart surgery, I watched how the stress of trying to keep up with everything by ""doing everything right"" as far as ""the American dream"" goes- took such a massive toll on his body and mind. The day after his FMLA ran out he was supposed to return to work.. but was informed instead that they had already replaced his position (they had found a legal way to do this without any severance). Of course that meant for him a gap in health insurance, and him scrambling to figure out how he was going to pay these bills.
