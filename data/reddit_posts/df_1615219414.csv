5,m0iw95,"First off, glad to share the fields of battle bois, you all are fucking grate.

So by now we all or at least WE should all know that you need to move your account out of RH. I've had a Fidelity account open for a few months now, but haven't transferred yet for the reason below.

Those of us that haven't left RH yet, Its because were afraid of missing the squeeze while out account is in transit to our new broker. I've gone back and forth between pulling the trigger and just getting the move started, but with a once in a lifetime chance with the stock here I just cant bring my self to go until its done. A lot of you have moved to other platforms, and I haven't seen a thread like this made yet, so lets get some insight from others here.

Those of you who have moved to other platforms, how long did it take you? If this is a process that takes like 5 business days, I'm not sure I can take that risk. Comment in here and let us now how long your transfer took, or an opinion on just getting it started or not. I see comments all throughout the subreddit about this but never a dedicated thread to bounce ideas and actual experience off of.

&amp;#x200B;

Discussing this with wife earlier...

Set up a GoFundME/CrowdFund project with the sole aim of raising brand awareness of Meme stocks(AKA Over Shorted Stocks specifically GME/AMC/BB/Nokia)

The funds would be used to purchase and install (professionally) Gold Chrome Wrap on each vehicle. 100% fully wrapped.

&amp;#x200B;

I have access to a few high end vehicles within my immediate circle of folk we know and we too have some very nice high end vehicles and reside in DC/VA. 

Our idea is to wrap the cars Gold Chrome With Meme Stocks on them with various phrases and emojis we use on reddit... We also wanted WSB to submit their designs of the car wrap designs and for WSB to vote on which ones get picked.

The list of guaranteed cars we can put a full wrap on for 1 year.

\- Tesla Model X( the one with the Falcon Wing Doors)

\- AMG GTS

\- C63 AMG

\- Porsche Cayenne GTS

\- Tesla CyberTruck (Pre ordered first batch delivery hopefully)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

I have a few decent cars I'd be willing to get a complete Wrap done depicting a design(s) submitted by WSB users and those designs MUST be voted on by WSB for said vehicle(s)

The Gold Chrome Wraps for the vehicle(s) and the install will be crowdfunded online and to the wrap job should be done within 10-14 days of funds being paid to the Car Wrap shop.",Would Y'all Be Down To CrowdFund Meme Stock Awareness?,1.0,1615219557,Oh_FuFu

Everyone is losing their minds..

Oh no. The internet is taking over! The stream wars is upon us! Obi One Stay Homie because of the pandemic...

Yeah yeah yeah.

Your forgetting key fundamentals to the current film industry though!

You see. Movie theaters....
They sell you an experience!
You wait in line with a bunch of ganja scented slackers in front of you and that weird guy with his mom behind you. You get your 🎟, and immediately your babe is like, I want popcorn and raisinettes. So you spend $40 on some snacks and drinks and you go in this super dark room with a bunch of strangers and nothing but a kid with a broom and an endless supply of gun for security.

You, hopefully, were smart enough to pick out some dope seats. You watch some movie theatre exclusive commercials, and you enjoy watching the movie and reacting with the crowd during scenes where gasps and laughs are acceptable. You finish, stick around for post scene credits, and leave your shit on the ground like its your first time getting laid.

What am I getting at here?!

Lets take a worst case scenario. Disney, Paramount and everyone else in the world says 'go screw yourself"" to AMC. They get no new movies. Ever again.

""Yo, general public!"" Shouts out AMC! ""Were hosting a Marvel Avengers marathon for the next 35 days! Every fucking movie released by Marvel since 1913, we are playing, come check it out!""

You like the Dark Night? We got that.

Ever wondered why Frozen is just the Lion King rehashed into a Disney Princess for the fan girls who don't give a fuck about Mufasa? We will play them back to back with a live rendition of Macbeth an enlighten you to the truth!

AMC has so many movies, they couod create a monthly subscription for you to go out and watch old shit on the big screen and rake in 50 times the profits they currently do for the next 1000 years!

What I do not understand is why this thing keeps getting shorted? Does someone understand how a foundational company like this can continue going down while everything else spikes?

Just goes to show that these slimy firms dont understand that this community still remains a bunch a troglodytes (in the best way) let me explain:

Firstly we cannot be reasoned with. 
""Oh so my 12k investment just became 4k? So what your saying is the stock is cheaper to buy"" is a common mentality. And somehow it fucking works. 

Secondly the concept of loss to them is something negitive. But not this community. This group thrives on masochism, the red gives the same, if not more pleasure than the green.

And lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY 
At the end of the day, we dont care about money or fame. Even though ive been lurking here since I got onto reddit, I know that WSB is a community of people who share in each others pleasures and pains. Laugh together, cry together, mostly laugh but through it all ive never seen such an amazing group of people. On what other subreddit can some new piece of meat to join and say something as brave as ""if this stock hits X amount im gonna tattoo the logo onto my butt"" and to not only do it because someone marked it down but for everyone to congragulate them on it.
