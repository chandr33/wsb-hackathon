The automobile is obsolete for the purposes of the everyday man, and honestly, the whole concept was dead before it even hit the mass market. Horses are the superior solution. **You should be investing in horse**

Now, before I go any further, I'd like to clarify that I'm not a horse nerd. There are no horses in Trigun so they can't be THAT important. They're not my favorite animal, I don't really have a top 10 favorite animals but if I did they probably wouldn't be on it. I don't know any horses irl, I haven't studied them or anything, I probably know more about any random breed of dog or species of bird I've been around in everyday life than I know about all horses combined. There are anime I haven't seen that I might know more about and care more about than horses if it weren't for the economic importance of horses as a mode of transportation. The point is there's no personal bias behind this belief, it is all logic and math and rationality. I love cars too, but car people are objectively wrong and always have been and we need to accept that. ~~I am secretly a horse.~~

I'd also like to clarify that this post is not satire, I sincerely believe in this thesis even though I recognize that it's funny. It's also funny to me that no matter how I try to drive that point home some people will still insist it has to be satire, so I'll just leave it at that.

#The Horse of Christmas Past 

Horses were here before us. Humans evolved over the past few million years, becoming today's species in the past few hundred thousand. Horses became what they are today 5 million years ago, after refining similar prototypes for 50 million years. Their evolutionary tree advanced more quickly than ours due to shorter reproductive generations. In some ways, they are still more advanced than us because of this and will continue to be until we master genetic engineering. Humans are only the most evolved species by certain key metrics, and because of that many foolish humans underestimate other species. 

While we were adapting to live in dense forests climbing around in tree canopies and visiting the ground to hunt and forage, horses were adapting to the ground. While we were adapting to eat everything possible and kill everything possible, they were adapting to live on sparse vegetation and just chill and try to avoid predators. 

But they couldn't avoid us. We started figuring out how to navigate wherever the fuck we want so we weren't just limited to the dense forests. We got more and more nomadic coming down from the trees to chase more and more difficult prey as our ancestors developed the peak levels of a skill nothing else on earth could ever achieve before or since.

Horses must have been a supreme challenge for us from the first time we encountered them in the plains. We were so used to chasing down such beasts by then, yet they surprised us with how difficult it was to catch them. We couldn't always predict their actions. They would sometimes be smart enough to fight back before getting exhausted, which was a problem for us when we didn't have guns and didn't have a chance of killing such large prey without exhausting them before the physical engagement. And it took forever to exhaust them. They could outrun us so badly over a short distance and they have instincts for avoiding tracking. We could kill anything we put our minds to, yet they became one of the few animals even our most capable ancestors saw as too difficult to be worth attempting to hunt if any other options are available. 

So our two species developed a relationship of mutual respect. Humans weren't like this with many species back then. And humans continued to advance and like 10,000 years ago we got to the point where we have agriculture and we can start choosing which species to hunt based purely on preference. I guess sometimes some crazy horse must have actually let someone get close to it without expecting to get killed, and the crazy person it happened to must have been like ""I'm gonna climb on your back now pls don't kill me"" and at some point around 3500 years ago someone in Asia did that without getting killed and everyone thought that was cool as fuck so the idea of trying to get close to horses and climb on their backs caught on. 

Next thing you know Mongolia was like ""we have horses and we're pretty good at dealing with them, let's breed an absolute shitton of them and come up with creative ways to use them for warfare"" and soon they were taking over everything on the horizon of their sphere of influence by doing drive by shootings with horses and really powerful bows and arrows that no other military at the time could do jack shit about. 

**The mistake those militaries made was they underestimated horses and fell behind in cultivating them as a resource.** Also helped that they made the same mistake with ranged weaponry. Does the US military have enough horses today? I don't think so. We just overcompensate with ranged weaponry and it's pretty gay. Mongoloids can still fuck us up any time just in a different way from how they did those ancient militaries. 

Horses continued to grow in prominence as the preferred method of transportation. Humans worldwide grew into the lazy species we are today, incapable of hunting without artificial assistance for our lack of cardio. Horses grew into a staple of the shared global culture of nations and the abuse and neglect of horses that was deeply ingrained by the militaristic history of their domestication also became embedded in human social culture along with them. Life with horses was easier for humans, and less healthy for our bodies and souls. We committed deadly sins and poisoned the well of our collective timeline on this planet. Greed. Sloth. Gluttony. Rage. Some British royalty even went as far as lust. Our relationship with the horse couldn't get more fucked up.

Or could it?

#The Horse of Christmas Present 

The new Bugatti has over 1000 horsepower. The horses on the plains are last year's model of cars overflowing from the parking lot, remainders from what didn't move in holiday sales. The new Model S measures its horsepower in watts, and it can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 2 seconds. 

The anthropocene extinction event killed the last surviving member of yet another species in the time it's taking you to read this.

We were set up. The bank will give you a loan for a car. They won't let you finance a horse. 

Henry Ford knew you'd think this shit is cool. But how would you justify the cost? The car had to get cheaper than the horse. Someday it would have to reach the people who couldn't even afford horses in order to outcompete them. But it couldn't do it on its own. For this to be accomplished, the car would have to get cheaper, *and* the horse would have to get more expensive, relative to what people could afford in terms of both time and money.

Fools said Ford's business prospects were impossible. Too contrary to the realities of the market. But Ford was no fool, he knew which way the wind was blowing. The world was being taken over financially by oil barons and confidence was fading regarding the ability of the gold-backed US treasury to maintain economic control and stability. Oil was becoming the new backing of the US dollar and Ford was betting on it. 

Others didn't see the market forces that would require this to happen. Sure, the working man might not want to say goodbye to his horse, but the industrialized world needs him following a strict routine and getting to work on time and he wants to get home in time to relax a bit without having to clean a horse stable. With this new form of industrialized poverty subtly squeezing the average family's wealth and freedom away from them with promises of a better future, all Ford had to do was offer a vision of that future he could materialize and he'd have the support of the ruling class and their underlings alike.

We are on the verge of a blue ocean event. Oil is becoming difficult to produce and transport to consumers at the scale of today's demand while the most easily accessible supplies run dry and we turn to more and more difficult sources. Global agriculture is at war with an ever-intensifying barrage of freak weather events. Those in charge say it doesn't look like anything to them.

To understand what's happened here, you have to look at it from the perspective of someone who had a horse before Henry Ford, and did not have a horse anymore after. Most people liked their horses and wanted to continue having horses. Cars were less refined at the time and didn't do as good of a job of hiding their drawbacks, and people not being used to them weren't going to hide those drawbacks from themselves too eagerly either. They were more complicated to deal with than horses, with machinery that could need repairs instead of biological ability to heal. They were large and powerful and metal, with no minds of their own, and could thus be used by idiots to get in terrible car accidents endangering everyone else, especially pedestrians. They caused pollution. They got their fuel from gas stations very particularly instead of a wide array of potential sources. They had obvious benefits and they were obviously cool but a lot of people hated them and even people who liked cars wouldn't think horses were totally inferior in comparison. So how were they convinced to not have horses anymore, almost universally? If you realistically imagine being alive at the time and going through it yourself, it's clear the benefits of the car were made more important than the drawbacks by factors outside your control and you were forced to choose the car over the horse. Maybe you were an early adopter or maybe you were one of those people who hated cars, but either way, society shifted into one that expected you to have a car and not everyone had money for both a car and a horse. 

The new Hellcat with over 800 horsepower is the perfect gift for a loved one! Look at this relatable commercial of a car in a driveway with someone crying about how surprised they are at it! Don't drink and drive 😉🙈🙉🙊

Whoever said people would have wanted a faster horse, they were wrong. People were already faster than horses over a long enough distance and span of time when we discovered horses, though not by much. We got slower by switching to horses from our own feet. But we got a higher top speed, which is why we did it. And we'd have adopted cars for fun if they had a higher top speed than horses while being slower over long distances, but poor people still would have used horses for that long distance capability. The ruling class are the ones who cared about the time cars could save us rather than the fun that could be had with their speed. They wanted us to switch from horses because they wanted us to be faster over long distances to make the economy work the way they wanted it to, not because they knew they could make bank on how fun we would think it is to go zoom zoom. Hence cometh the pressure to adopt the automobile. Understand this. 

And while Henry Ford wanted horses to be seen as obsolete for the sake of his business, the masters of the economy wanted horses to be abandoned by as many people as possible in this transition to the automobile. If they made sure nobody was poor enough to be forced to choose between a horse and an automobile, then nobody would be forced to go to a gas station, ever. It would always be optional. If gas got too expensive, people would just take their horse places instead of their car until gas was worth paying for again. Oil barons would have to do actual business. That's not how they do business. They needed the masses reliant on an oil based infrastructure and economy.

Now here you are, surfing WSB and reading what's probably just a massive shitpost to distract yourself from how depressingly difficult it is to escape poverty. 

How much horsepower does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll pop?

How much horsepower does it take to move a skyscraper-sized cargo ship run aground in the Suez Canal? 

How much horsepower does it take to dominate global militaries? A lot more than it took in the time of Mongolia. 

We can't afford all this horsepower. Nature did not intend for it to be wielded so carelessly, so she's sent the repo men to collect it from us. We've been in a car chase trying to get away for a while but it's not going to happen. We're going to run out of gas and we know it. 

Cars once seemed worse than horses because they were big metal machines with no minds to stop idiots from crashing them into things. Now a Tesla does have a mind of its own and it convinces idiots not to stop it from crashing itself into things. 

Everyone is piecing together their plans for what to do when it's over. Some people are trying to go to Mars with Elon Musk. Some people want isolated off-grid self-sufficient defensible properties here on Earth. Some people want multifuel military trucks or engine conversion kits to run their cars on biodiesel. Some people are struggling to accept the bad possibilities facing them and start planning for them at all. I want a horse.

The descendants of those global oil barons have bunkers and nukes. 

We have billions of humans who don't want to be ruled by criminal psychopaths.

How terrifying for both sides.

The arctic is the most powerful weapon humans have and it's already been activated in this tension. We fast-forwarded to the end of this ice age and it's upon us now.

The ruling class have been planning for it ever since they started getting good at climate science, about halfway through their first century of global dominion. This transitional period is doing most of the work for them in culling the growing rebellion worldwide and most people might not realize what's going on for quite a while. They're hoping the remaining populations will be easier to dominate and control. They want as many servants as possible remaining in the end so they do try to give everyone a chance to survive. The extent of the culling is up to the reactions of the populace. After a certain point their protection just runs out and you're on your own because they can't afford to control this population anymore and they've chosen to risk the fate of the planetary ecosystem itself rather than risk being overthrown so they're not going back on that. Metal as fuck, mad props.

They even spread a myth that humans are overpopulated, as if it has nothing to do with people using vastly more expensive resources than necessary to accomplish basic tasks in maladaptively unnatural ways. They try to convince you they're being perfectly reasonable when they keep death rates close to birth rates to do ""population control."" This campaign has been so successful some people are cheering now that the death rate starts to exceed the birth rate and life expectancy goes down. It's eerily similar to people who insist they have to use crude oil to avoid being controlled by the ruling class, somehow.

Horses were our friends and we didn't deserve it. We shouldn't have betrayed them. 

It's ok. They'll forgive us. They're fucking retarded too.

#The Horse of Christmas Future, or: How I Learned To Reject Society and Return to Monke

^(The soundtrack is now ""Civilization"" by Danny Kaye.)

When the oil infrastructure collapses, people will need horses again. 

But not for transportation, since we'll probably be doing plenty of cardio all the time and at this point we've invented the bicycle.

It's their industrial output that can interfere with the plans of the ruling class. We're not supposed to be in charge of our own freight transportation when gas stations are out of gas for good. The intention of giving everyone vehicles that are difficult to power independently is to ensure that. Horses fuck that all up, the ruling class would have to nuke all the grass to stop us from fueling them. 

Those who have horses will be in a good position to survive because of this. When everyone else runs out of gas, horse people are one of the options they'll turn to for transportation of goods. A horse and buggy carrying produce will be a regular sight to see. Their services will be in very high demand and they'll be paid well and they should be able to handle their own security too. They'll be glad they own horses. 

People who don't own horses will be glad others own horses for the same reason. They might become the thing keeping your grocery store alive. If so, you will wish more people all over the country had horses so stores could have more stuff in stock instead of struggling with such a downscaled supply chain. And you'll definitely wish you were one of the people with horses. 

Living in an area with low population density and high horse population density will be good, not just due to the correlation between wealth and having horses, but due to the cause and effect of horses being useful. 

But this won't protect us from crop destruction or nukes. It only helps you stay alive longer. It lets you avoid having the collapse of the oil based transportation infrastructure be the thing that kills you. Owning a Cybertruck and a renewable power source could do basically the same thing for you. No big deal. 

The effect gets a lot more interesting with a critical mass of horses. And the possibility is so interesting because unlike Cybertrucks, horses are self-replicating, so it's plausible we could have that critical mass of horses. 

If everyone had a horse right now, this whole transition could essentially be stopped in its tracks. The next stage of the plan the ruling class are following wouldn't work and adapting on the fly would be difficult for them. I guess that seems like a moot point or a catch 22 since it's the reason they don't let everyone have a horse, but think about it. 

Let's say life gets a lot darker one of these days while we all have gas and electric cars and the people of California decide to secede and start a civil war over the crimes of the ruling class because they're starving to death. The ruling class can just cut off gas and electricity in California and make a powerful example of them. 

If everyone had a horse in addition to their gas or electric car, it wouldn't make such a powerful example for the empire's side. If anything California would make it better propaganda for their side by Frankensteining together a new mix of an industrialized economy with horses doing industrial work and inspire other surrounding states to do the same. Using horses for freight would free up a lot of off grid power sources for factories and stuff to keep operating. Maybe some gas could even be conserved for emergency vehicles.

And what are they going to do instead, just use the nukes? Kinda hard to do that reliably without a bunch of escalation and fear mongering leading up to it. ""Nuke california the moment they threaten secede over starvation conditions"" doesn't have a great ring to it. They have to abandon certain policies and come up with a better plan.

Obviously, the idea of everyone having horses is unrealistic. But it doesn't take everyone having a horse. 60% of people suddenly having horses within the next 5 years would make a huge difference. That's closer to realistic. Hopefully what can realistically be done is enough to make a dent. Right now there are areas with enough horses and areas without enough horses, and investing in horses at least has very realistic potential to shift an area from not enough horses to just enough horses for when shit gets real. Increasing the land mass controlled by people with enough horses helps the whole planetary power balance.

Horses aren't the only thing like this. There are lots of things the ruling class don't let too many people have because they can foil these plans so bigly if everyone has them. Investing in any of those things can make a huge difference. 

But horses are special in this category because they're self-replicating. If you spend the next few years dedicating your life to getting as many horses made and distributed to citizens as possible I think you'd have more success than trying to do the same with Cybertrucks or self-defense Predator UAVs. Timmy Horsecum could make Johnny Appleseed look like Jim Eagle.

The more money you put into horses, the more you'll be glad you did when the horse vs oil arc gets closer to its conclusion.

Horses offer the potential for a future where instead of going extinct or entering ages of depression after running out of oil, humans just go back to being the best long distance runners on the planet and we overthrow our shitty ruling class and we build a society with all the greatest strengths it can have. A world where you trade some silver for a physical copy of a video game and then walk out of the store and jog home past farmers hauling produce behind their horses. 

This could even convince the ruling class to just stop culling people by easing the tensions that drive the conflict. They get less control, but they're also less threatened by people who are content with a healthier lifestyle than their own unnatural luxuries. Maybe seeing the losers of the rat race break out of it and find such a wholesome way to live with less luxury could even convince them the rat race is pointless. Lol nah

If Elon Musk is serious about making Earth sustainable and preventing climate catastrophe, he should be investing billions into horses all over the world. He should be saying donkeys will be used on Mars for certain work until it becomes feasible to bring the mass of horses there for more serious work. Cybertruck can be the official truck of Mars, but if there's ever any kind of economic crisis on Mars that impacts things like factory output or electrical capacity people will be glad they have self-replicating self-healing haulers called horses as an emergency backup for stuff like tilling crops or hauling ores. 

Horses in space. I wonder how fast a horse could run on the moon. What an astonishing era of progress and development we could be on the cusp of.

#Horse through the lens of top-down analysis 

Some places are better for business than others. The same countries that are best for business are usually also best for horses. 

Examples:

* America is a decent country for horses because of its wealth, which also makes it attractive to investors.
* Venezuela's inflation crisis hurt financial performance there tremendously, and also likely made it a worse place for horses. 
* The covid crisis made Earth less attractive to investors and made Mars travel more attractive to investors. The covid crisis probably killed horses on Earth via supply chain issues and stuff but did not hinder any future potential there may be to get horses to Mars.
* Places with very fair weather are good places to be a horse, good places to own a horse, good places to run a business, and good places to own a business. Erupting volcanoes are the opposite end of the spectrum by all these same metrics. It all scales proportionally. 

So, whatever market you choose to invest in, it is probably bound to be a good market for horses. GDP growth and such metrics are surely causatively correlated with horse health and the economics of horse ownership.

When assessing different sectors within an economy, horses are relevant to the most important sectors of every economy. Freight is important everywhere and they can be used to power it over land (while sails are ideal for the seas, but that's a whole other post). I'd argue current global market conditions make freight important everywhere. And in countries that are in economically strong positions, it's easy for horses to compete industrially in those economic climates because those are the countries that can afford to implement things like the carbon tax to reduce any undeserved or unnatural economic advantage the oil industry's infrastructure has. Work horses exist on earth but they are so underutilized in the developed economies where they could be most competitive that people in developed economies forget they do even exist in the world. It's a huge gap in global markets and it could be an absolute money printer. 

Sector-by-sector, freight isn't the only place where horses can be useful. Take agriculture for example, it's another very important industry in every market worldwide right now and another industry horses are actively used for in parts of the world today. Let's make that more parts of the world.

As far as I can tell, top-down analysis should lead you to see favorable environments for horse investing all around.

#Horse through the lens of bottom-up / fundamental analysis 

Horse is one of the longest-standing investment vehicles and there couldn't be a better definition of buying something at the bottom. Fruits and veggies are the absolute oldest investment, but they have had steady growth all along while horses have been pushed back so heavily by central bank meddling that they're at least as primed for a short squeeze as silver. Horses haven't been as undervalued as they are today since before the foundation of Rome. Yet they've survived that whole time without going bankrupt, and they're primed to explode in value. Horses might seem expensive right now, but when you adjust for inflation and consider that the people who first domesticated horses were risking their lives to do it, we're actually way below IPO price. The share price might have been lower even adjusted for inflation back when there was more dilution but I doubt the market cap of horse has ever been this low when you account for the total float of outstanding horses. 

**Management:**

The CEO of horse is mother nature, the most badass CEO of all time. The other C-level executives are all horses, the most retarded executive team of all time, so management is a mixed bag in terms of credentials. But while their competence is questionable, they have survived in virtually every market on earth for thousands of years without any operational interruptions, and this is still the same CEO who pulled through all of that with the same retarded horse executives, so I have faith in horse's execs to keep the company afloat for the foreseeable future and do the best they can with the realities of the market. I do think it would help if activist investors would get involved and bring what they can to the table when it comes to executive direction. 

**Financials:**

Horse has $0 of debt and $0 of cash on hand. Liabilities are in the thousands of dollars per year per horse and revenues are dependent on utilization of each horse and market conditions. There will never be a year where horse reports negative EPS, because horse doesn't report EPS; instead, every year, the most profitable horse investors make money and the least profitable horse investors lose money. All you have to do to guarantee good returns on your horse is actually use it for something profitable instead of just keeping it as a pet since that's all the average horse investor really does. Horse breeding, for example, is a profitable business with good revenue.

**Market Valuation:**

The current market cap of the horse industry is less than a trillion dollars worldwide. It's not even as big as the market cap of agricultural equipment. The auto industry is worth well over a trillion dollars. When horses are more useful than cars and tractors again, the horse industry may be worth multiple trillions as it consumes multiple other industries such as these. 

The common opinion right now is that horses will never overtake these other industries again. This false assumption is what leads horse to be undervalued. There can essentially only be upside for horse's value in this situation because if the market is right, the value of horse doesn't go down as they continue fulfilling the role the market expected them to have, but if the market is wrong and horse does become the new way to get to work, the value of horse can be expected to increase in the eyes of investors.

#Comparison of horse against other investment vehicles 

In retrospect of everything this post has established so far, let's compare horse to other prospects you could put your money into. 

::: | Horse | TSLA | SPY | BRKA | Cannabis | The Cult
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
**Track record** | Millions of years of uninterrupted operations | Like a decade of bears getting rekt by cool cars | Stonks only go up | Grew from a textile mill into a multi sector corporate behemoth | Dank | Pumped a dead stonk from $5 into the hundreds
**Potential upside** | Could save you and the world from the apocalypse in exchange for your friendship | Could save you and your world from the apocalypse in exchange for your eternal soul in the Matrix | Stonks only go up | Old dude could be smarter than everyone else again | Legal market share can only increase and there is no cost to having the world saved | Could pump more
**Potential downside** | Will die and make you sad | Might kill you while you cross the street on Mars someday | Stonks... Go down? | Old dude might not got it anymore | World could end before legalization | Big dump could kill all pumping 

There are other good opportunities on the board, don't get me wrong. Cannabis is indeed dank. But the horse really seems very competitive with all the best things you can compare it to.

#Why gambling on horses is the ultimate Wall Street Bet and this post isn't just a joke

You want to make the ruling class suck your dick and prove you're smart enough to beat the market, right? Investing in horse puts the ball in your court. Like I said, there will never be a year where horse reports negative EPS, instead there are individuals who get positive and negative EPS every year and the question is whether you're going to be an above average or below average horse investor. You can't boil it down more than this. 

People have also been gambling on horse races since long before there was Wall St. If you start a big horse corporation you can bring it full circle. 

And the hedgies can't compete with us on this. They aren't going to set up horse stables on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange or in the offices of Citadel. The best they can do is trading horse futures on their computer screens. The everyday man will be the one who can actually take physical delivery, not the big traders. It lets us turn the tables on them in this financial arena aside from how it throws a wrench into their plans to cull us with the peak oil collapse.

Now, if you're with me so far at all, the best you might be thinking is ""ok, I'm convinced, it would be great if we all invested in horses. It's funny that such a ridiculous idea can actually be convincing. But it's not gonna happen, this post isn't gonna trigger a wave change in society, not everyone reading this is gonna buy a horse, horses are just expensive as fuck and the only people who can really take this post seriously and expect to make money are people who just like horses a lot.""

You underestimate me and yourself. I'll be trying to get rich enough to put real money into this horse idea like Elon Musk did with Tesla back when electric cars sounded almost just as retarded. If you buy a horse or invest somehow in horses right now you'll make bank if I succeed. Or maybe I'll fail and you can be the one to succeed, *if* you're as ballsy as me and take the concept seriously enough to try. All it takes for the idea to actually go from a funny reddit post to an economic sea change that was once hypothesized in a funny reddit post is for the right person to try hard enough to make it happen.

If humanity survives much longer, there will be some period of time with fewer trucks and cars, more horses and bicycles. It's not a joke taking that seriously before everyone else.

Their stock just tanked after announcing a plan to add some new shares to the market. However, they also just released a report on the 27th of March, showing some pretty positive growth. With net revenue and income up from 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure this isn't the most official place to find information about it, but this article shows an quick overview of how the report went and it looks to have been positive across the board.

[https://www.evolving.com/resources/press-releases/evolving-systems-reports-its-2020-year-end-and-fou](https://www.evolving.com/resources/press-releases/evolving-systems-reports-its-2020-year-end-and-fou)

&amp;#x200B;

You can see from the chart that the share price tanked hard on the 22nd and bottomed out on the 29th before rebounding pretty hard today. We'd been floating around $2.75 for most of the day and ended up squeezing out at $2.85 right before market close. Would you guys consider that a good thing? Seems like there were people who wanted to buy in more than there were people who wanted to sell. If that's the case, would it be reasonable to assume this behavior will carry into tomorrow?

What happened to the SeaWorld price when Blackfish came out in 2013? It went on a slow and steady decline from 2013 all the way up until 2018. If you look at the chart, you'll see that right before the pandemic $SEAS was trading just a hair below the ATH it had hit pre-Blackfish, just under $40.

# Quarterly Earnings:

In February SeaWorld reported it's 4th quarter earnings:

&amp;#x200B;

* Deficit for the 4th consecutive quarter
* Revenue down 48%

&amp;#x200B;

SixFlags is up 43% this year so far and Cedar Fun is up 28%....not even close to the ridiculous 66% that $SEAS is up so far this year.   


Also note, the U.K. and Brazil are the two largest contributors to visitors to SeaWorld theme parts....and both of those countries have harsher lockdowns than the US and will likely continue longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I think we can all learn from what happened with Bill Hwang is that you can get caught with your (Free)Willy out when you're long a postion...not just short. If you have too much leverage in something and it starts to decline, you can get margin called.  What do all the ""smart money"" people shove their cash into now? cyclicals (banks, industrials and other BS) but also the ""re-opening"" play.   


Wall Street smart money thinks they can get in this re-opening play trade early, then dump shares to the dumb retail traders down the road. Things like $SEAS are incredibly overvalued right now.   


$SEAS has the next earnings report sometime in the first half of May....As the market is closed right now and I can't buy any puts I do not have any positions yet but plan to buy puts for May 21st when the market opens tomorrow.   


""smart money"" thinks SeaWorld stock chart is doing this:

93,mgpk3m,"Think about it. All those toys you see at GameStop, Costco, Walmart, Target etc especially the Mario ones and Disney ones, guess you supplies them? (J -a -k- k- s P- a- c- i- f- i- c) toy company. The MOST undervalued company doing north of $510m in sales and valued at pennies. They underwent massive change over the last 3 years from changing margins from 18% to know 32%. This is worth at least $60-$100 bucks, and APE like this supplier. Ape want more ape to buy this supplier that give bananas to GameStop. We will call company ""JP"" as Ape mods do not like small price, but will like big banana in future it will give. 

I studied this stock alot, like spent easily a few weeks gathering information and emailing IR(you can email them to if you want with reasonable questions). Also, my posts kept on getting deleted because of links and smol market cap, but all this info is public so you can find it yourself if needed(SEC filings or PRs and mods...cmon let it be this time ;) .Currently still a top 5 global toys producer in the United States($516m in revenue at 2020 FY at only a $40m valuation) , JP struggled ALOT in the past when it was hit hard by the Bankruptcy of its single largest customer: Toys R Us and ineffective execution. So for the past several years it has been spiraling down while also fending off multiple takeover offers. The most recent was in late 2019 for roughly $9/share which was rejected by management as it was clearly too low. However, there was another offer in 2019 from an investor/collaborator within the company: Chinese owned Meisheng Cultural which offered $29.5/share to increase ownership to 51%(they have 18% rn). JP management was receptive to this idea, but faced complications from Chinese and American politics/legal for this international investment, which caused the deal to fall through. So we can at least get a glimpse that at minimum, JP Management believes a roughly $30/share base for its company is reasonable, but still likely won't be accepted by them, especially after the changes they made.

First the recent Q4 highlights, stock is now derisked significantly and anything that is single digits is a great deal. Shares are hard to come by in this low float. Some recent news from Q4 and stuff:

Consensus was ($1.63), they reported ($0.80) EPS

Beat revenue by $1m, reported $128.3m in Q4 revenue

""For the last two years we have been working diligently to improve our profitability, even as we have faced significant revenue challenges. We've embarked on a 3-pronged plan to improve results. We posted a fourth quarter operating profit for the first time since 2013. Our full year operating income was the highest level since 2016. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million, the highest level since 2016, and up nearly 50% from last year. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate was the highest quarterly gross margin rate in nearly a decade. "" -Stephen Berman CEO

**Full year revenue was $516m**, it was lower than last year due to COVID and the frozen toys hype died down.

**Margins improved significantly from 18% in the past to now 32%, which is VERY good. Last time they were these margins it was a $50+ stock.**

**Have you heard of the company Cra-Z-Art? Yeah the chairman of that bought recently close to 11%(522k shares) of JP and personally knows the CEO for over 30 years now. This is massively under followed and undervalued. Been under the radar for a good while. Now it will shine like a diamond. Also other institutions have been re-entering slowly under the radar. Single digits will not be here for long imo.**

Cost Cutting- In 2019 they hired an independent financial firm to provide analysis on ways to improve margins and lower costs. Furthermore the company has removed low margin licenses(like funnoodles) and started to create their own high margin-proprietary IP like Xtreme POWER dumptrucks, etc. If you take a closer look their margins have improved from low 18% to now close to 31% which is 2016 levels when they were trading above $50 bucks a share. Quote from the CEO in recent profitable Q3 earnings of $242 million : ""As we have since last year, we continue to focus on improving profitability more than just capturing sales. We are weeding out low margin products, high volume, but low margin promotional programs that we ran in the past were not repeated this year. As a result, our gross profit margins came in at the highest level of any quarter in 3.5 years. We believe our cost structure now will allow us to generate much higher levels of profitability than in the past when we see a sales growth return."" Their margins and in this make or break business, are finally returning to their former glory levels. This is VERY important, which suggests more sustained profitability. They don't just want sales anymore, but profitable sales. Also even when compared to hasbro, mattel, etc they have very weak/negative Q1 and Q2, then strong Q3 and Q4(coming up in 10 days).

Debt/Liquidity: The company renegotiated senior and term loan now due Sept 2023, which total to approximately $150m. They prepaid $15m upfront this year and aim to prepay another $5m if allowed by the creditors this year, which decreases that total. For a tangible asset company doing half a billion in sales, this level of debt isn't bad at all. In terms of liquidity, they have cash of roughly $93m and an additional $37m in revolver credit available. In cash alone, thats over $18 a share. They have no concern of any bankruptcy or restructuring. Financially healthy, and a continued target for take over. "" we ended the year with $93 million in cash and the lowest net debt position since 2013. ""

Management: added new people to the team, like John Kimble as CFO, who is a former Mattel Exec. Right from the get go, he publicly states his aim to turnaround the company and create shareholder value. Management is key, especially in a turnaround story. Also management owns roughly 30% of the entire company, so they have quite a bit of skin in the game. The founder is the CEO, Stephen Berman, I don't really like him to much in terms of execution, but in terms of connections he is golden(WWE, DISNEY, MARVEL, etc).

Licenses: Do keep in mind, that this company receives a large amount of licenses from almost every Disney movie (they just recently got the entire toys contract for Raya the last dragon movie AND Encanto), Nintendo, Warner Bros, Microsoft, Haribo, EA and Many Many more. Companies will kill for these relations. Also, their main office is inside the Disney campus in California, I WONDER WHY???? This a ridiculously undervalued stock is poised for a great recovery to its former glory. Its hard to evaluate the real worth of these relations, but its not easy to come by. There is a reason why they get these licenses every year. The only downside to these licenses is the low margins, but the relationships are invaluable. Not just any company can get into Disney. Their Apex Legends toy lines, which they recently got the whole contract as the global toy master for them, is doing very well.

Disguise: If you were to try and pinpoint asset of theirs that you could value. I would say their costume brand Disguise, which just got two new contracts with Blippi and Kirby (Warpster, a Nintendo subsidiary). If you go to Costco, you know those racks of childrens costumes they have, yeah its all JP. They also own the Disney Princess and frozen stuff, and alot more disney. They got into Costco, and they also sell in Gamestop, Walmart, Target, etc. This asset does over $200 million a year in High Margin revenue, which isnt even reflected in their stock price.

At the end of the day, this company is worth $50 MINIMUM, which still values them at $250m MC. They made a lot of solid changes, they stayed afloat during covid, and have VERY valuable relationships. It has a very low float, with only 6m shares outstanding, they did a reverse split 10-1 a while back. With real volume, this thing will shoot parabolic. I am talking $100+ potential, which still values them less than their annual sales. Hope you guys see what I see. Ape out. Cheers :).",No Need for Ape only get one banana?
