I’ve been learning from this sub as much as possible lately and I’m starting to understand the basics enough to loose my first $100 haha.
I’ve seen old posts about which apps to use but the recent market disruptions have changed opinions on some apps... I’m ready to buy but I’m confused because old posts say “X”, app is good but since the market stuff “X”, app is getting hated on. And so on with other apps.

The trouble I’m having is with apps... I’ve heard a lot of negative comments lately about some apps limiting/refusing so sell during the short. I’ve also heard some apps are difficult when withdrawing cash to a personal bank account. I like the idea of receiving a tax form from the company so I can properly pay my taxes.

Since the recent market disruptions, the view seems to vary greatly now on apps and their services.

I’m in the USA.

#They will let it rise.
$500?
$800?
$1000?

And as their last resource. They will make it drop RIGHT THERE and start with the media saying, that was it. That was the squeeze.

*The shills will spread FUD*

*The shills will post gains that are tempting to the eye. Making you want to do the same.*

*They will sooth your smooth brain with false words and false DD.*

*They might go as far as clossing all subreddits to cut communication and cause panic.* 

An animal that is cornered and about to die will fight with everything they got.

#I need you to know. That this is higher than $10k, $50k, $100k... 

They need the shares. At whatever price I decide to sell, they have to buy it. 
All the numbers, all the DD, everything, points to those prices. Truth is, their is enough money for everybody willing to hold and sell at $500k. Looking at you DTCC...

How much would you buy a bottle of water for, if you're in the middle of the desert dehydrating? 

Everybody probably knows already. But for those that maybe don't or need a little reassurance:

#Shorts have to cover eventually. They do not expire and mean while, they are bleeding $$$ trying to kick the can down the road with different methods trying to make you sell.

Do not be fooled. Do not try to fool them by Day-trading thinking you can make money. Every share they buy at low prices ($200) is a share that you could've sold at ($10k) and a share less they have to cover. Meaning that the momentum upwards just got shorter because you thought it would be nice buying low and selling high over and over again.

 Also don't set and wait for a certain date. Nobody knows when.

*This is not financial advice*

Memorize all this in your head. Right it down if you have to.
