**What is UWMC?**
 ‚Ä¢ United Wholesale Mortgage is the #1 wholesale mortgage lender in the United States!

**How did UWMC perform last year?**
‚Ä¢ UWM‚Äôs results for the 4th quarter and full year ended December 31, 2020. UWM reported a net income of $1.37 billion for the 4th quarter and a yearly net income of $3.38 billion. That‚Äôs a 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. 

**Why should I invest in UWMC now?** 
‚Ä¢ UWMC is at a great entry point due to the recent market sell offs + low volume. It has a HIGH of 14.38 and a LOW of 7.24. Currently trading at 8.30! 

**What are the upcoming MARCH catalysts?** 
- UWMC ULTIMATUM 
- RUSSELL INDEX INCLUSION 
- CEO (MAT ISHBIA) TO BE ON CRAMER  

**UWMC ULTIMATUM:** 
Brokers have until **March 15** to sign an agreement pledging to stop working negotiations with Rocket or Fairway. UWM reported that large broker shops across the country have already signed the UWM ultimatum, representing over 90% of broker shops! 

**RUSSELL INDEX INCLUSION:** 
The Russell 1000 and 3000 slated to include UWMC into the indexes on **March 21**! 

**CEO TO APPEAR ON JIM CRAMER THIS MONTH:**
https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1366913790806212609?s=21 

Was that a quick read or was that a quick read? 
(I may have lost the energy to keep typing mid DD) 
So what‚Äôs left to say?

Disclaimer: **I own shares of Aston Martin Lagonda** and I am talking up my book. Opinions only, no advice. 

**Bull case:**

* New exciting models being introduced esp. new SUV. SUVs are proven to be money makers. Since Lamborghini and Porsche introduced SUVs they have become best selling model for the company. Now it's Aston's turn to make money by selling an SUV called DBX.
* Reducing inventory: Poor production had lead to inventory pill up but now that is resolved. Previously their cars were crap that didn't sell. But now things have changed. 
* New F1 team: after decades of absence from F1 AML is returning to F1. There is a lot of buzz about them getting back into things. They have Vattel as their primary driver with proven track record. They are expected to finish ahead of Ferrari. 
* Demand from China: China has an insatiable appetite for luxury cars. They are selling at huge premium there. This is lifting all luxury goods esp cars.
* New 007 movie: we all associate Astons with Bond, James Bond. There is a new Bond movie coming out this year. It is confirmed that the new movie will feature an Aston as Bond's car. 
* New AMG partnership: The engine, electronics, transmission for Astons are supplied by AMG division of Mercedes. This means quality and reliability. It also means it will be easier to service new AMLs. 
* Resale values are picking up. Previously Astons used to be hit hard in used car market, but that has changed.

**Bear case:**

* Show me the money. Right now the finances are not looking great. Company is cash poor and has a short runway to show that the turn-around plans are working. Dilution is possible.
* Hard hit due to Corona. For a company in a delicate financial position the Covid hit came at a bad time. European reopening is being sluggish compared to USA and this will hamper AML's ability to show it's turn around efforts are working.
* This weekend Aston's F1 team didn't perform well in testing laps.
* There is some logistics issues with shipping cars and bringing in supplies due to Covid and lockdowns
* Brexit and currency exchange rates may become headwinds. 
* Poor management but new great board members.

30,m5cfft," Let me start this by saying I'm no where near an expert on financial analysis / stock valuation, the reason I'm posting this is because I want to find the flaws in my thinking, or on the off chance that I may be onto something it would help point me in the right direction.

First, the **price to earnings (p/e)** of big lots when compared to its competitors.

**BIG: 3.75**

COST: 33.84

TGT: 20.89

WMT: 29.70

DLTR: 17.96

This was the first metric that caught my interest. Why is big lots trading so cheap? Are they in massive debt? Low revenue streams? What's the deal?

**Price to sales (p/s)**

**BIG: 0.38**

COST: 0.82

TGT: 0.97

WMT: 0.71

DLTR: 0.95

Again by this metric big lots is selling 2 - 2.50x cheaper in comparison to its competitors.

**Debt to equity**

**BIG: 2.35**

COST: 2.93

TGT: 2.80

WMT: 1.87

DLTR: 1.97

Big Lots is just about average in this sector. Not great but not horrible either.

**Revenue growth** **Past 5 Years (per annum)**

**BIG: 9.14%**

COST: 11.80%

TGT: 10.89%

WMT: 0.53%

DLTR: 14.31%

With big lots showing relatively consistent revenue growth should they be trading as cheap as they are? They aren't losing money and are still showing competency.

Analysts project the next 5 years (per annum) to be 9.38% while the sector median is sitting around 8.82% projected growth. As far as bankruptcy their debt isn't anything unmanageable, don't get me wrong it's not great but moderate. In addition to that is big lots is heavily recession resistant they thrive on economic hardship. I'm pretty confident in saying that big lots isn't going anywhere at least for the next 5-7 years. Indeed there has been a big run up on stock price in the past year the p/e ratio was at 2, it is now around 4.5. In the past decade they've traded at an average of around a 10.. and the economy due to the corona virus has taken is pretty large hit. 

In conclusion, I'm not seeing any sufficient reason why Big Lots is trading substantially cheaper than competing companies. Big lots doesn't show any signs of weakness in any area (that I'm aware of) I know there's probably a lot I'm missing and I welcome any criticism/critique you may have. As it stands right now I am considering it a buy. What do you think?",Why is big lots selling so cheap when compared it competitors?,1.0,1615781533,IndicativeInvesting

 I wanted to do a quick refresher on $UWMC that breaks things down in a hopefully delightful write up. I've noticed recently a lot of $UWMC post on the DD flair and elsewhere have stolen what I've wrote and what other investors and reddit users who are invested in $UWMC have wrote. (The users that I'm talking about literally copied and paste from other posts including my own). üòÇ I'm not even upset, totally happy with providing and sharing information in the community, but at least site the original posters or re-write the shit or something. üòÇ

Anyways before I break everything down in point form, if you want to better understand what the company is and get a better in-depth understanding of the stock, then please visit my original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly2o5t/uwmc/) , I've also posted links to the other $UWMC reddit users who have written good DD on them with different perspectives and there's even a lot of information provided by actual mortgage brokers who work in the field and use UWMC and explain why the love it so much. 

Anyways, here's the break down.

1) UWMC is going to be included in the Russell 1000 &amp; 3000

2) Largest wholesale mortgage lender in America

3) They use and own their own proprietary software and system. Through this they provide customers and businesses such as banks, credit unions, brokers, real estate agents and lenders the capability to approve and close their applications quickly and efficiently. Actually, their system is so quick that their the leader in their market and hold this as a key major competitive differential over their competitors. 

4) They work for and support brokers wholeheartedly. This is good business for customers and brokers.

5) They've grown %545 this year alone with earnings forecasted to grow %4.83 per year.  They are also heavily undervalued. Currently going for the $8 price range which is the bear bottom in this bearish market. The fair value analysis is at $19.34 - $40.00. Source: SimplyWallStreet. [Here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings). 

6) Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million. 

7) Short interest is very high. As of the last 2 weeks the short interest volume % has been between 28%  - 31% over the last 2 weeks. That includes the day I think 2 weeks ago when the average trading volume of the day was 90+ million. The last short interest update from general market analysis companies are dated 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock has a dividend payout as of 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82, so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC. Source: Fintel. [Here](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc). 

8) Major market analyst have $UWMC rated as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.

9) Their CEO is heavily invested in the companies core mission, values, and goals. 

10) Market Cap: 16.58B

11) This is both a short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to hit it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride. Plus, it has a dividend of %4.82, or $0.10 per share quaterly. I'm not a big fan of dividends, but I know a lot of investors are.

12) This is very important, in comparison to a lot of mortgage underwriters such as Rocket Company that have both retail and wholesale channels, or that are primarily retail underwriters, if the bond yield percentage goes up and causes inflation, UWMC will reap the majority of businesses. Once inflation kicks in, people don't just start hauling mortgage purchases, what will occur is that customers will go to only wholesalers biggest they'll be able to provide the best rates, especially if inflation hits, if it ever does. This would mean a lot more business for UWMC as a whole.

This is just some lightweight DD for those who are interested in the stock and/or are invested in the stock and for some reason are losing faith because we're in a bearish market right now.

This is not financial advice, this is ape advice.

&amp;#x200B;

1. UWMC is going to be included in the Russell 1000 &amp; 3000
2. Largest wholesale mortgage lender in America
3. They use and own their own proprietary software and system. Through this they provide customers and businesses such as banks, credit unions, brokers, real estate agents and lenders the capability to approve and close their applications quickly and efficiently. Actually, their system is so quick that their the leader in their market and hold this as a key major competitive differential over their competitors.
4. They work for and support brokers wholeheartedly. This is good business for customers and brokers.
5. They've grown %545 this year alone with earnings forecasted to grow %4.83 per year. They are also heavily undervalued. Currently going for the $8 price range which is the bear bottom in this bearish market. The fair value analysis is at $19.34 - $40.00. Source: SimplyWallStreet. [Here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings).
6. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.
7. Short interest is very high. As of the last 2 weeks the short interest volume % has been between 28% - 31% over the last 2 weeks. That includes the day I think 2 weeks ago when the average trading volume of the day was 90+ million. The last short interest update from general market analysis companies are dated 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock has a dividend payout as of 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82, so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC. Source: Fintel. [Here](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc).
8. Major market analyst have $UWMC rated as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.
9. Their CEO is heavily invested in the companies core mission, values, and goals.
10. Market Cap: 16.58B
11. This is both a short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to hit it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride. Plus, it has a dividend of %4.82, or $0.10 per share quaterly. I'm not a big fan of dividends, but I know a lot of investors are.
12. This is very important, in comparison to a lot of mortgage underwriters such as Rocket Company that have both retail and wholesale channels, or that are primarily retail underwriters, if the bond yield percentage goes up and causes inflation, UWMC will reap the majority of businesses. Once inflation kicks in, people don't just start haulting mortgage purchases, what will occur is that customers will go to only wholesalers because they'll be able to provide the best rates, especially if inflation hits, if it ever does. This would mean a lot more business for UWMC as a whole.

This is just some lightweight DD for those who are interested in the stock and/or are invested in the stock and for some reason are losing faith because we're in a bearish market right now.

More in-depth DD on my reddit with other perspectives from different investors.

This is not financial advice, this is ape advice.

For example. Let‚Äôs say GME is at $250

I want to buy a put expiring in a week saying that GME will go to $50

Let‚Äôs say GME goes to $40 a share

Do I make the the difference between $250 and $40

Or do I make the difference between $50-$40

This might be a completely ridiculous question. And I understand GME won‚Äôt be at $50 in week it‚Äôs just an example. I also understand buying one contract is x100

To try to put it in simpler terms, Let‚Äôs say one contract was just one share not 100. If I buy a put of GME while it‚Äôs currently sitting at $250 and I think Ittl hit $50 in 7 days. And it goes down to $40.

Do I make $210 or do I make $10

Thank you
