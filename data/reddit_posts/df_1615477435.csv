42,m2t8dv,"Roblox is basically virtual Legos. The Lego Group had a revenue of 38.5 billion Danish krone in 2019. Now, I'm not familiar with the Danish krone, nor Denmark itself, nor any foreign culture as a whole. But, I know they use the metric system. Therefore, we can presume that the exchange rate between krone and USD is roughly equal to 3.28 USD = 1 kr (since that's the conversion from feet to meters) This gives a revenue of $126 billion in 2019. Now here's the tricky part: since Roblox is digital, that means the information carrying the parts move at the speed of light along internet wires. Therefore, we can estimate that Roblox will have a revenue equal to ($126 billion) * (2.99*10^8 m/s) = $3.76 * 10^19.

My father and I made a bet on the presidential election and I came out $50,000 richer. It initially was only for $100, but my father was so deep in the QAnon conspiracy theories that my temper wanted to raise the stakes to numbers that I hoped would make him shut up. As it turns out, his best friend told me that my father took that bet because he wanted to give me that money. As I'm typing this, my eyes are already welling up with tears. 
I've used approximately 29k of the 50k to buy GME. 7k got burned buying $115 call options back in late January that expired on my birthday and that's when the GME price tanked towards $40. I diamond handed those options from a 30k profit to an absolute loss, even when my father suggested that I sell GME days before he was hospitalized. I'm as stubborn as he was.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/health/obesity-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide.html

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183

From New England Journal of Medicine:
“In the semaglutide group, approximately 70% of participants achieved a weight loss of at least 10%, and approximately 50% achieved a weight loss of at least 15%. Furthermore, one third of participants treated with semaglutide lost at least 20% of baseline weight, a reduction approaching that reported 1 to 3 years after bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (approximately 20 to 30% weight loss).”

Patent protected in US until at least 2031. 

Also known to be safe as same medication is second best selling GLP-1 agonist for Type 2 Diabetes with few side effects reported. 

Even better: Novo (world’s largest maker of insulin and now newer GLP-1 agonists) already markets the first ORAL GLP-1 drug, simply the same sumagluptide branded as Rybelsus. 

Priority review voucher applied to New Drug Application (NDA) with FDA, leading to an anticipated review time of six months. So hopefully approved in next few months. 

People have not been receiving preventive care due to pandemic. And globally (Novo has patent protection in China too but shorter) only 2% of estimated 650 million people receive any treatment because right now either surgery or no good options (will change shortly). 

With millions returning to their doctors now even fatter after Quarantine 15, really think stock is a no brainer. Priced super cheap too.

Wanted to share a company I just found last night. Pericarditis is a current COVID-19 complication and I believe that it is a very hot ticket item right now. This being worldwide exclusive and breakthrough therapy means that the market is wide open. From looking at their clinical data their recurrence rates and pain relief are substantial!

Their CEO, Sanj K. Patel, previously took Synageva public and eventually sold it for $9.5B. The BoD is heavily invested with the chairman holding ~10% of the float. Current stocktwits followers is ~1800 meaning this baby is flying lowwwwww on the radar. I think it is poised for a PDUFA run up and possible early news. I think we are ahead of the game on this one.
