I studied the price action of GME for the past 2 months in relation to SSR. There is alot of posts that just assume long HF want to hit SSR every single day and its such a huge advantage which is not supported by price changes on those days. I think it is important for Apes to level up and not believe things just because some youtuber says it and it is now echoed everywhere.

When GME lifted off from 20 to 483. SSR was triggered 1 time. 2 out of 13 trading days from 1/13 to 1/27.

This was triggered on 1/15 (Friday). There was a flat day intraday 1/15 and all day 1/19 when it was on SSR.

GME run up number 1

When GME fell from 325 to 38 in early February, SSR was triggered on **10** days at least partially out of 13 total trading days. Most days on between run ups were on SSR. Why would you want SSR again?

1/29, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 2/5, 2/9, 2/10, 2/17, 2/18.

Peak of GME run up 1 and flat phase between run ups.

When GME lifted off from 38 to 250. SSR was triggered **1** time. **2** out of 13 trading days

GME spent 1/2 day on SSR Friday 2/26 after noon ET . 1/15 was a slightly red day as well. This was during the very beginning of the second run up. It was ultimately a slight red day, but it still closed over 100. I am sure call option fighting was very much on the line 2 Fridays ago just like it is every Friday. GME kept on rising the following week even after a red Friday. So this importantly shows GME can take an SSR day on the uptrend.

&amp;#x200B;

GME run up number 2

Currently 3/10 happened so GME will be on SSR for part of 3/10, all day 3/11, and 3/12 so far has been very flat.

Given GME history on SSR, the reasonable conclusion is that today will be flat. I think it is misinformation spread by a youtuber and redditer that has made people believe SSR is something that it is not. The evidence supports not putting that much stock in SSR. I think wanting to hit SSR is a made up story that sounds good on the surface.

Guess what happens on a steady comfortable march upwards? Few to no SSR triggers which is what I think GME long holders *should* want?

TLDR:

With the exception of 1/27 -2/1 (the first fall)GME is usually flat and very boring on SSR days.

GME does not need SSR to rise very rapidly. It makes no sense to wish for it.

SSR has been documented at the beginning of long run ups- only a few days out of the whole run.

**You should not want SSR. You want the price to move up so it doesn't even sniff SSR!**

I am long GME, but I think this subreddit should level up and stop believing echoed misinformation when the facts don't back it up,

I like the stock.",What GME actually does on SSR days.,1.0,1615562343,tjmaxx1234

12,m3jpcy,"Heads up, autists... the resurgence of Blackberry is beginning. $BB stock has jumped over 20% from last Friday's low and broke through multi-month resistance. Why is it starting to run? the reason is that it’s a solid post-COVID recovery play.

The company’s recent movement comes largely from the announcement by the US President Joe Biden that electric vehicles (EV) – and other green energy initiatives – will see massive investment worth billions of dollars. Even better, President Biden stated he would be changing 650,000 federal vehicles into EVs. BlackBerry stock could rise as its QNX software remains at the forefront of autonomous vehicle use where security is a major issue.

Blackberry used to make phones that were hard-to-hack; they no longer do that. Now, they're a software company focused on integrating their impossible-to-hack QNX software platform into every element of the transportation industry: autonomous EV's, advanced driver assistance systems, platforms for automakers, smart city infrastructure, IoT logistics and cybersecurity for connected cars. This is a legit company with huge upside long-term.

I'd pay attention to 1) the chart action 2) evidence of increasing QNX adoption by automotive manufacturers 3) Low implied volatility on the options.

I’m long Jan 2022 25c options. **I LIKE THE STONK**
