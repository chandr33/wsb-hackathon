3,m1trxu,"Stock prices are fungible, meaning it only takes 1 trade between you and me to increase the market cap by billions. 
Here's an example, let's say apple is trading at $120, and the market cap is 2.07T. I want to buy 1 share, and all of the sudden your the only person in the entire market willing to sell, but you want $125 for it, and so if I buy that 1 share valued at $125, that 1 transaction adds 85B in market cap, making the new market cap 2.15 T.    
$125 trade, resulted in a 85B bump in market cap. This is fungibility. This is how it's possible. 

If there's 12 million shares short, the only way we get to Valhalla is via shorts covering. In order to do so, you must not freak out and settle for a quick flip, thinking to yourself ""I'll buy back in"" because guess what? That first time you sold was a short covering, and now they're out of the gme, so who's going to bid the price up now? You? Me? Our goal is to take from the hedgies, not each other!

Who am I kidding, we all know there will be plenty of us retards buying at these prices because the FOMO is real.

Vinfiz has this ticker at over 60% short. The average volume is 1.8m and the float is only 3.9m.   [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ATNF&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ATNF&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1)

Iborrowdesk has the current interest at 46%.  It was 63% a couple days ago.  The fee started going up on the 19th of Feb.  This corresponds to spike in volume to 5.2m.  There is basically nothing left to short as there are 4k available today.   [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/ATNF](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/ATNF)

Its recently closed at 4.79.  Back in November the stock lost around 80% of its value in a month.

GOCO reported earnings yesterday, they made money 133 million or 41 cents per share. 

Fourth quarter 2020 net revenue of $445.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period, and fiscal year 2020 net revenue of $877.4 million increased 63% compared to the prior year period

They are forecasting 1.15 Billion in sales to 1.3 Billiion in sales for 2021 that is 50%

They are expecting earnings of 345 to 385 million that is on 321 million shares.

Let me translate that for you apes! 

**That is at worst $1.07 Per Share Trading at Under $10.50** 

**That is an 8 PE, You will not find any company growing at 50%+ a year with a PE under 8.**

Woke up in the middle of the night to see our Europoor friends did us well. (294 right now! Thanks again!) So with that adrenaline I knew it would be tough to get back to sleep. Naturally, I went outside and got ripped. Alien OG. Good stuff. 
Anyway- I was out there watching DFV’s Mario video and and remembered the part where he is asked if he would like to be changed back with this Ice Cream Cone. That doesn’t happen in the game. The king doesn’t change Mario back to anything. He wouldn’t say, “Should I change you back with this scepter?” and Kitty just changed out scepter for ice cream cone. It’s a totally added question. Which leads me to the timing. It was fucking perfect. Right before this steady liftoff. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing (Willy Wonka scene). Mario refuses the change, he likes bein that mother fuckin frog. And god dammit, I’m a fan as well. So the king isn’t going to use the MACD to change the frog. It’s staying froggy. The alien OG is clearly now in full effect. I think this makes sense, but maybe I lost some there. Alright then, back to bed to get a couple more hours before work.
