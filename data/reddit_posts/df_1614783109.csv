Has every sorority girl, Becky and Soccer mom stopped wearing these because the pandemic is over? Are their stores reopening as the virus is contained? March 24th ER and should have a good run up with a pop after a big beat.

60,lwvsg9,"$UWMC BIG EARNINGS MARCH 22ND

UWM recently went public with a valuation of 16B calculated at 9.5x using the companies estimated adjusted net income of the first nine months ended September 2020 which was 1.7B x 9.5 this is BEFORE their record breaking earnings in Q3 and Q4 numbers were considered.  

In Q3 they closed 54.2B in closed loan volume with 3.18% margin which equals to 1.45B in net income. This is a money printing machine especially with low interest rates and a booming housing market. Pays a dividend at .40c/share, current yield is 3.6% at $10.88 you will be buying in at the floor after consolidating for weeks.  

Q4 net was an over 800% increase from Q3

$UWMC has also been included in the preliminary list of IPO additions for the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indexes on March 22nd!

86,lwvvfn,"First DD. Let me tell you why this is ready to moon:

Short interest: Apes learning to squeeze has been the greatest revelation since the discovery of FYRE by Billy McFarland. I will keep this one short. 47.25% short to be exact (relative to float). 2nd most shorted stock after our first true love $GME. Pretty squeezable if you ask me.
https://www.highshortinterest.com

And for all you GME Tards out there downvoting this... MELVIN CAPITAL IS BETTING AGAINST THIS STOCK. HERE ARE THE PUTS THEY OWN
https://fintel.io/so/us/skt/melvin-capital-management-lp

Small market cap: As of today this company is worth 1.52 billion. $RKT Market Cap moved from approximately $40bn to $80bn in two days this week, and arguably has more upside to go. If $SKT market cap were to increase the same amount, it’s a 27x BAGGER!!!!! This stock can LITERALLY go to $400+ based on previous experience alone, AND there’s much higher SI. 

Building Awareness: I set myself up for $RKT and $GME by getting in ahead of the general curve. I am 2/2 on meme stocks so far, and this sweet sweet baby is sitting right in our wheelhouse. I watched as it started to shudder AH yesterday… and I knew it was time to bust out the vaseline but my wife’s boyfriend already used it all. 

Common sense: Does anybody really think shopping centres are going to be a thing of the past?? If I’m spending my tendies to buy clothes I’m sure as hell going to try them on. Sentiment is changing FAST. All lagging stocks have finally started booming, Texas dropped restrictions, $SKT go BOOOM 🚀

Open Interest: the call to put ratio is looking TASTY as of late. Lots of new calls being opened, and puts are down.
https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/options?p=SKT

The name: I predict Lil’ Jon will be the number one artist of 2021 when this mafucka leaves the stratosphere. Worth a buy just for the memes

Misc info for your reading pleasure: 

* Quarterly Dividend of 4.33% implies health and balance sheet strength. Also free tendies.
* Price action steadily climbing since March 2020 crash. SUPER healthy chart movement over 1yr. Can’t believe it’s even shorted right now tbh, those HF’s must already be lighting money on fyre. 
* Brick and mortar isn’t going anywhere
* Some guy on here said he drove by a mall and the parking lot was full

TL;DR this is the next $RKT but…. dare I say better? 

Resume and disclaimer:

I hit 732.67% gains on $RKT calls bought this week. I sold at $33 like a PAB but got in way ahead of the curve. 

$SKT Positions:
4/16 20c 
4/16 25c

And fuck it. If this hits $250 WSB can vote on my tattoo.

Welcome to the next. Big. SHORT. AWWWWW $SKT $SKT MAFUCKAS 🚀
