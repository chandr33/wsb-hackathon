4,m3p4qa,"This is my first DD. I want to talk about CureVac, $CVAC. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I just like this stock for money-making purposes. 

TL;DR: CureVac should announce promising vaccine efficacy by end of March. Short-term OTM calls until something prints. 

I've been watching vaccine news and yesterday just after market close Novavax announced that their vaccine candidate is 96% effective against COVID. $NVAX closed at $187 last night, and peaked this morning at $214. Enough time to ride the rocket and close a position after open. 

I'm not going to focus heavily on financials, board of directors, market saturation, blah blah blah. I'll give the highlights of what they're up to. They started phase 3 of their trial in December 2020, and expect to announce preliminary results 90 days later - so by end of March. Their version is stable for 90 days at normal refrigeration temps, like J&amp;J. January 11 they announced that their tests in non-human primates showed:
&gt;""Induction of robust antibody and T cell responses at lower dose than tested in Phase 3 trial""    
&gt;""Full lung protection of CVnCoV-vaccinated animals during SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection""

Full trial info (PDF warning): https://www.curevac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201214-CureVac-HERALD-Clinical-Trial-Protocol-of-Phase-2b_3_CVnCoV.pdf

There is a LOT more information in another DD posted by /u/kbxl [a few weeks ago](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liodt0/curevac_cvac_making_the_coronavirus_vaccine_for/) if you want to see some more. 

Now, about why this is the time. When Pfizer and Moderna announced efficacy rates they saw reasonable, though short-lived, volume and price spikes. Johnson &amp; Johnson's announcement coincided with an earnings release so it can't be correlated. But, to make money on these you'd have to have already owned the shares or calls, and hop out on the ride up.

[Pfizer, announced efficacy 11/8, UK approval 12/2, USA 12/11](https://i.imgur.com/cySFVKX.png). They did also announce a 2021 Q1 dividend on 12/10, which surely helped share price - but it was already on the way up due to the approval news.

Anyway...

The reason I’ve gathered all of you apes together is to tell you that I am not a stock advisor. But ironically, Michael Burry and DFV aren’t either. Maybe Michael Burry is considered one because he’s a professional asset manager, but regardless, it turns out he’s very bullish on CoreCivic (CXW).

Now, I eat crayons and don’t do that much research when I gamble away my rent money, but I see that he added 1,000,000 shares of CXW after selling Google/Facebook. My limited understanding of CXW (based on a quick googly) is that they are in the private prison sector or something. I don’t know about political shit because I’m not a loser, but I’ve seen price target for this stock is around 15-15.60. 

Current price is 8.50 as I’m typing this on the toilet. 

I’m not telling anyone to buy at all, I’d honestly rather just get shit on (not literally but I wouldn’t mind if one would oblige) because a lot of the time I do research on stocks you apes prove to me how I’m actually just a retard.

Summary of DD:

Burry is bullish on this shit which means something.

But more importantly, hopefully through some sort of prison reform these private detention facilities will receive a larger percent of inmates. At least this is my basic understanding.

I didn’t post a chart because I can’t read numbers very well and colored lines make me dizzy (unless they’re in the shape of crayons and in that case I eat them by the case). However the charts look like this stock is trading pretty much at the lowest it will be; 52 week low was around 6 and high around 14 so it pretty much is bottomed out in my opinion and may be a good buy.
