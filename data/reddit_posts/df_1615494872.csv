The image speaks for itself. MACD and RSI trends look similar to what we saw pre-first surge, but a LOT bigger in magnitude. GET READY TO LIFT OFF.

For all the retards - we are at the yellow arrow on the right.... it is very similar to the position we found ourselves in on the left arrow (pre-surge) but A LOT BIGGER. BUY NOW AND HOLD LADIES AND GERMS

32,m307et,"...Because I know none of you peasants book hotels anymore... and why would you? Airbnb is the only way apes travel. The upside potential on this stock is huge. 

I don‚Äôt do fundamental analysis. The only rule I have when investing is to buy companies that still have a visionary Founder or CEO who manages their business for growth instead of boomer metrics like quarterly earnings. $ABNB still has their founder at the helm and the guy is obviously a cold blooded killer. You don‚Äôt build a company like $ABNB otherwise. That said... If I were to do some kind of ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù I would say... 

1. $ABNB just crushed earnings.
2. They handled the pandemic extremely well, like as good as any company really could. They basically did everything right. Got a $1billion loan, cut cost (they even cut exec pay across the board) and at the same time protected customers. I‚Äôm sure you had an Airbnb booked when the pandemic hit and got a full refund... just think about how shitty your experience was with canceling your airline tickets. They also launched a fund to reimburse hosts for cancelled stays and opened a fund to help hosts pay mortgages. Point is they handled a major crisis extremely well, which goes back to my point about capable leaders managing for growth.
3. Travel is going to explode this summer. I know every single one of you has a wedding or some kind of event booked every weekend from July 2021 to Dec 2022. Where are you going to stay... Marriott?

This stock reminds me of $TSLA. $ABNB is positioned to be the single largest travel company in the world and actually provide a great service. They will start turning a profit within the next 12 months and the stock will make a major move up. Eventually it is going to get into the S&amp;P and then üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

34,m307uj,"Take a deep breath.
It can be tense out there, huh?

I'm sure it is. Look at your hands, all cramped up from all that holding. You're bold, you're daring, and you're strong. Ease up a bit, have a sip of that ice-cold water. Need a few more ice cubes? Here you go.

So, here you are. You've held for this long and you're continuing to hold. First, you thought of selling at $10,000, but you soon realized that was far too low. $100,000 was your new goal, but even that changed into an even higher number, the one of $500,000. I understand why you're aiming for that. Basic supply and demand, right?

I can see your hands cramping up again, holding on even tougher. I invited you here today because I want you to reflect on the past. The first massive squeeze towards the sky. Man, that was something. You bought high and averaged down all the way to a point that was higher than the lowest dip. Your account saw so much red, yet you didn't sell. You completely ignored the ""cut your losses"" mantra and you held. That requires courage. But it requires even more conviction. Only those like you, bold enough to believe in something that might change the world, are the ones who can actually change the world. Many have done so before you and eventually, you will become the next in line. The daring, the bold, the brave. The holder.

Yeah, have another sip. Good. Go on, have another.

Take another deep breath.

You saw the media coverage. The growing attention. You saw the restricted buying, yet you held. You watched the first Senate hearings. Man, you watched every single Roaring Kitty video and you learned so. unbelievably. much. You made new friends and new enemies. You continued holding. You saw billboards arise from the ground on your commute to work or back home. You held. I can't imagine what that must be like, to believe so hard that you're willing to give it your all.

You held so long and you experienced so much in this run, it's almost like it has been a year! And you're still here. You endured. You persevered.

I respect you. Most of all, I respect your vision and your belief in that vision.

Yes, a big gulp, and another breath. Look outside, at those joggers. They're focused on their run, on their calorie losses. They want to become fit and healthy. They're determined to continue their run. And another run. And another. It's the same with you. Determination. Perseverance. Heck, those joggers don't even know you might be a millionaire soon! Hah!

Need another pillow? Just take it easy, it's all good.

You endured through all the punches. Yet you didn't give up. You fell to the canvas a few times. Yet you didn't give up. The legendary boxers, I'm sure they would nod their head at you in respect.

Let me end our session with a few more words. They might be the most valuable ones of our talk today.

With goals and conviction and pursuing those, there are only two possibilities: either you fail or you win.

When you're so confident, so persevering, and nothing can sway your mind, then there's only one outcome.

And you know which one that is.

Of course i hardly understand any of those charts you post or how to interpret triangles or whatever. So i made a stupid graph that any ape will be able to understand. 

**And this graph will show that we're fine.**

The dip yesterday didn't kill us, it was nothing but a panicky reaction to apes gone wild! See for yourself, i just took this a few mins ago from yahoo and painted some lines to illustrate my point:

https://preview.redd.it/nyek27p6jgm61.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=261a60997c4f0989986d5058f4c34a91c9b67909

The trend is upwards. Every single day we grow. The dip was, imho, a result of us going wild. But the trend is still upwards. The rise and the dip has, as other people already mentioned, revealed a fundamental problem. Stop Loss Orders. Hell i dont want to know how many brave apes we lost because of this dip. Even i got kicked out of the game because of this. 344$ reached, all hell broke loose, my SL set to 227$, everything went to fast, my SLO sold at the lowest point of $198. 

Gosh was i pissed! Oh well, YOLO, bought myself into the game again. Why? Because we are still on the rise. Simple as that. Look at my pretty picture apes, and stop being scared. Everything will be fine. 

As long as we HODL, nothing can happen to us, we just bounce back. Even if they hit us, we will rise - as long as we dont sell out.

One more thing: I didn't set a SLO this time.

Over the past few weeks we've seen how the media twist shit just to fit their narrative (nothing new) and how little journalism means these days. Their only strategy is to create chaos and divide people, but why you might be asking, you fellow ape. Well, to be straight about it, it always comes down to money. Lobbyist will pay millions so you say whatever is in their best interest. These people are the same that fund politicians campaigns.
No matter on which side you are, both are lie, because both are benefiting from the caos, they're against each other, their partners and they're ripping YOU off.

Honestly with today's amount of fake news spreading faster than your wife's boyfriend's sextape, you know the one where you're in the corner watching, it is extremely hard to know what is true and what's not and to be honest people don't care enough to fact check everything they see. And for the most part people tend to stick with whatever they heard first. The media has known this for ages, they know that they just to be first not right.

REDDIT IS DEMOCRATIZING THE NEWS

As for old school media, there's really no way of stopping their nonsense since it's not an open forum where everyone can call you out on your bullshit.
That would be reddit, the place where if you start to talk out of your ass, you'll get bitch slapped like a 50s housewife and put in your place.
This plus all the down votes,will send your comment lower than my portfolio throughout February.
This is a huge step towards democratizing the news, obviously it's not perfect, but it works because these aren't people who are getting paid to say certain things

             But how would we defeat old media?
                      YOU ARE THE PRODUCT

This means they need your time and attention to exist otherwise they're just talking to a camera. If you know that whatever news broadcast has lied, misused sources, etc. Know that this isn't a one time thing. 
Now that you know you're been lied to, are you gonna still bother listen to someone who lies? FOR A LIVING.

Go and do your own research if something is important to you. We live in a time where we can search up literally anything in seconds. No generation has had this amount of power in their hands. They fucked up. This whole GME thing was just the first catalyst ...ddd people realize how much power they actually have.

For fucks sake there isn't a system without us.
We're paying politicians to control us, fuck us over and limit us. We are their bosses. They work for us.
                          .NEVER FORGET THAT.
How the fuck are peole even ok with modern democracy. We the people aren't deciding. We are deciding who our next dictator is gonna be. Why don't we all vote on shit that concerns us? Why do politicians have to do that for us? They are never gonna look for your best interest no matter what side you on, forget that.
A real democracy would be the people deciding every next move for the country based on reports made by politicians/outsiders that in case of being misleading or full of fake news would ban those people from ever be apart of our politics forever.

83,m30e90,"Analysis of Short Fee for anyone else to input thoughts.  


Generally Shorts Available decreases as the price goes up dramatically, as people bet on it coming down and take our shorts.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the short Fee % does not correlate exactly with this.  At the end of the 8th and into the 9th, the Fee went from 1.7% to 2.6%. Similar moves happened at the end of the 9th into the 10th. My guess was that the short providers increased price because the shorts were not winning their trade.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Short Fee was slashed from 2.4% to 1.1% right before the crash yesterday.

Then it went to 1.9% overnight, and back to only 1.0% today.

&amp;#x200B;

These moves do not work with the idea that the Fee % correlates wtih how many shorters are wining their bets.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is anyone elses thoughts?

Hey people. First time posting here I really think I'm following the rules, and if I broke them with this post please remove, and I apologize. 

I believe CYCC is shorted 30% and is prime for a short squeeze. Data is from market beat and I really think there is potentially a lot of money on the table if the squeeze and be squoze.

This is not financial advise. I just like the stock.",CYCC - 30% Short Interest - Short Squeeze,1.0,1615495793,senorsirsir
