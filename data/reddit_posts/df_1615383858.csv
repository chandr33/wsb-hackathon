You're likely going to see posts or news talking about how GME this time is a ponzi scheme and going to run out of steam. I mean look at short interest it's at 30%, only 1/3 of what it was the last time DFV made tendies rain from the sky. The reason that doesn't matter is **this is not a short squeeze, it's a gamma squeeze.**

For everyone one of you shit flinging baboons that's spending your life savings on an OTM call option and rolling in tendies there's a hedge fund manager who's cursing at his monitor as he watches GME 🚀 and has to cover his position. There is such a stranglehold on GME shares that they can't stop the price from going up, just look at the volume. **GME went up 25% on a day where volume was lower than the 30 day average.**  That's fucking absurd. 

So as long as these hedge fund managers think they're smarter than everyone else and keep selling options in mass, GME is gonna keep climbing. All the price needs to do is climb up the option chain, we saw it happen yesterday where the 200-250 option covering was so strong that GME didn't even dip below monday's close on it's way to going up 100 points in 2 days, 60% total rise, insane.  

TLDR: **When we hit 250 HF covering forces the prices to 275, which HF covering forces price to 300, which forces price to 350, which keeps happening till we're at the fucking moon.**

P.s. Even if HF stop selling calls you morons bought enough to give us plenty of rocket fuel to triple from here",Why GME $5000 isn't a meme,1.0,1615384453,smartbrainguy

What I have learned from my father about stocks, is that there are two very important things. 1). Do your own research, and 2). Stick to what you’re confident in. My recent research has included reviewing volume, market cap, revenue the company makes and ETF’s the company has. There are other really important factors, such as dividends, the actual share price, my loss if it flops 🥲. But yeah, in short: i like the stock. Simple as that.

THERE IS NO TIME FOR LOSSES. LIKE THE APE I AM, I WILL BUY AND I WILL HOLD.

What is the wash-sale rule?
When you sell an investment that has lost money in a taxable account, you can get a tax benefit. The wash-sale rule keeps investors from selling at a loss, buying the same (or ""substantially identical"") investment back within a 61-day window, and claiming the tax benefit. It applies to most of the investments you could hold in a typical brokerage account or IRA, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and options.


More specifically, the wash-sale rule states that the tax loss will be disallowed if you buy the same security, a contract or option to buy the security, or a ""substantially identical"" security, within 30 days before or after the date you sold the loss-generating investment (it's a 61-day window).",Time for a wash sale lesson,1.0,1615384630,funlovefun37
