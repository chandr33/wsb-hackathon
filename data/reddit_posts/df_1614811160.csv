There have been major crashes in my lifetime, because the ""American Dream"" died in the 90's. I'm assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you're a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!

I love Unicorns, so much so that it's my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a ""hypothesis"" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.

*So here's the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I'll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*

What you're looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!

You know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It's called ""C-N-N"" and it's like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that's what you are) and listen to them say things like ""The S and P is down 15 points today."" It's a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...

Here, I'll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We're going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?

So the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it's ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it's indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it's going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I'm making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I'm coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I'm right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.

These moving averages have the highest divergence they've ever had!! That's not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it's going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.

The next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won't get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you 🦍. Essentially ""traders"" (that's a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?

The last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I'm zoomed out so far that you can't see all of the warnings, but I've circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You've been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it's a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I'm doing and short $SPY.

Also, fuck your 💎👋 and 🚀 because I already played that game. You go 🌈🧸 or get stung now bitches!! 🦂

7,lx6bz0,"Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained 🦍, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.

Let's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \*% short float is at 47.25%!!\*Compared to every other ""meme stock,"" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).

Not to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.

The trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.

Over the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).

All of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since 🌈🐻 are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **✅**

Next, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the ""value"" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **✅**

Not to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **✅**

Where do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask ""wHy It DoNt Go Up,"" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).

So is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.

So help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!

\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.

8,lx6cbg,"(Don't know if this is okay to post it here, but would like to get some opinions)

Probably everyone has heard about a saying “buy the dip”. I know many believe it is a risky strategy, but there are plenty of research suggesting that over sustained time it might be profitable and sound strategy. For example, this one: [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/documents/MI-Research-QR-Buying-the-Dip-180522.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/documents/MI-Research-QR-Buying-the-Dip-180522.pdf) . Below are the results of back testing 2002 -2016 data:

https://preview.redd.it/ul5eb2a73wk61.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77a04df316cdb82863263a98623c7b97f135521

If you read the paper, you will find that these returns can be improved by using additional screening criteria and company fundamentals. Conclusion from there: “A sharp decline in stock price can signal an investment opportunity if investors can accurately identify which dip to buy and when to buy it. It is important to note that no one indicator can ever constitute a solid investment decision on its own, and BTD is no exception to this rule. In this paper, we examine several factors that may be used to improve the profitability of the BTD strategy. Our empirical analysis shows that institutional ownership level, stock price trend, and company valuation can all contribute to the overall success of the BTD strategy.”

Now all of this is cool and dandy, but how to identify those stocks? There are plenty of market screeners, that can show you biggest losers of the day, but how to know at what point dip the bottom? Well, que in support points. Some say that using support points is same as predicting future from stars or cards, but somehow dips always find their bottom and more often than not it’s somewhere around previous low points. I could not find any freely available tool, that could show me tickers that dropped to their support points (admittedly I haven’t looked for very long), so decided to build my own – The Dippinator.

I wanted something that gives me a lot of info in a single screen and where I could check the latest news or public opinion about the ticker to get the sentiment behind it. Took me a few weeks and now I have result – a tool that drops me an email notification when ticker meets certain conditions and falls below 3rd support point. To calculate these points, I’m using the following formulas:

1. Pivot point (PP) = (High + Low + Close) / 3.
2. First resistance (R1) = (2 x PP) – Low.
3. First support (S1) = (2 x PP) – High.
4. Second resistance (R2) = PP + (High – Low)
5. Second support (S2) = PP – (High – Low)
6. Third resistance (R3) = High + 2(PP – Low)
7. Third support (S3) = Low – 2(High – PP)

Conditions:

1. Ticker dropped below third support point and possible gain if it reaches 1st resistance point &gt;25%
2. Liquidity: AVG volume + Today’s Volume must be more than 1kk
3. Market Cap &gt;50kk

Have been running it for 5 market days. It has identified 326 events meeting the criteria above. Investing same amount ($100) in all of them would have yielded below results. These does not take into account a possibility that position could be sold before close at higher point.

https://preview.redd.it/mpc6b4s93wk61.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2468ea3e530bce4f7ee625b5cab6334bcd378522

Obviously, I don’t have enough resources to buy each event, but I have made some day trades and ended up with 14% gain (my biggest gains were from PLTR and FGEN). Combination of notification from tool and some manual screening should always give better results as some companies deserve to fall into oblivion. Furthermore, last 5 market days had a lot of volatility, so it might not be very representative of future performance.

I’m sharing all of this, because I think there is a possibility to use Dippinator as a pointer where to look. Problem is that I might be missing something and would like to hear your ideas, suggestions or critique. On red days it bombards with notifications. For example on 23rd of Feb I got 142 notifications (it kind of also helps to see early on the trend for the day).

Currently I’m scanning total of 5k tickers from US markets and data is refreshed every 4 minutes. Once ticker below 3rd support point is identified I get below notification. Example is end of the day 2nd of March. I will break it down bit by bit.

5. Where current price is in terms of support and resistance points

Price point – price of given point.

Price now

Gain to lvl – possible gain if price bounce back to one of given levels

PriceVol - % of volume around the given point. Using some psychology here – if there’s a lot of volume in the above price levels and current volume is low, it’s likely that price will go up.

This is what I received when decided to jump on FGEN for a quick trade:

At the moment that’s it. Sometime later I’m planning to add institutional ownership info and comparison against Russel 1000 performance as suggested by paper mentioned in the beginning. Supposed to improve the results.

What do you think? What other indicators would be useful? I know it’s not very pretty 😊I also might be slightly retarded.

Will post today’s results after the day close, but few minutes into market open received 68 notifications. It might be very red day…

**Update:** looks like it was a good decision to sit this day out. Made one trade with XL - 4.3% gain. Overall this strategy wouldn't work today, but yet again it helped to get a pulse of the market early on.

In today's session, AMD followed the market and dropped 3.50 points.

By looking at the body of the recent candle, we can see how bearish it is; very small wicks on both top and bottom of this candle indicates there was little to no movement to the upside and **bears were in control.**

Should bulls be fearful? - Only if tomorrow's candle closes below the trend line around the **78.00** area. The bright side is cheaper entries at this level, but patience is a virtue.

Calls on companies such as $MRO for June are still fairly cheap. As more states open up and vaccinations increase more people are going to be traveling after being inside for the past year and ready to spend money. Companies restructured last year to cut cost and with the oil demand going to pick back up to IMO prepandemic I think we see huge gains in oil stocks

97,lx6m8b,"So I found this from a Choice Capital Management letter and it does a good job of explaining how it is in a sense another Gamestop type stock that is misunderstood and has been thrown out.  


PBI – Pitney Bowes, Inc. embodies several characteristics that seem to show up in many of our investments. Overlooked. Unloved. Misunderstood. Sometimes all three. Together, these forces have pushed PBI shares lower for years. Of course, it is not too difficult to understand how this came to be the case. The company’s glory days back when it was lauded in Jim Collins’ Good to Great for leasing mail meters and offering presort mail services have long since passed. Though these businesses continue to generate nice cash flows, mailing revenues have steadily declined for years. Consolidated financials are not pretty, with earnings declining consistently for much of the past decade. All this, for a 100-year-old company that – not so affectionately these days – goes by the moniker “the mail company.” But buried within those consolidated financials that paint the picture of a shrinking company, Pitney Bowes has been building a very promising e-commerce business. It has been a long time coming, but after first getting into the business eight years ago with their acquisition of Newgistics, the shipping business appears poised to thrive. Other factors suggest the company’s fortunes may be turning as well. In recent years, the company has gotten serious about turning things around. Management has refocused the company around mailing, shipping and financing. They have sold off a number of non-core segments. In addition to refocusing the company and simplifying the narrative for prospective shareholders, these moves have also enabled the company to improve its balance sheet, with the majority of debt now supporting the company’s financing business. So now, “the mail company” is shipping, financing and mailing, with the emphasis on shipping. The Global Ecommerce business is promising. It serves a capacity-constrained segment of the economy that enjoys natural tailwinds from a package delivery market that has been growing steadily at a midteens annual rate for years. Its principal focus is on Domestic Parcel Delivery. Here it focuses on the middle mile, retrieving packages from small and medium size businesses and delivering them to the USPS, who handles final mile delivery. It also offers Cross-Border Solutions and Shipping Solutions, with a primary emphasis on offering transparent and easy to understand pricing models to its growing customer base. Before the pandemic, there were early signs of success. The Global Ecommerce segment had grown to well over $1B in sales, or nearly 40% of the whole company. But like a lot of promising young businesses, it was subscale and unprofitable. In 2019, the segment lost \~$70M, detracting \~$.30 from the company’s $.68 of earnings that year. But the pandemic looks to have accelerated this segment’s push to scale. In Q4 2020, domestic parcels shipped grew a promising 76% over last year. And by growing its top 1000 E-  Page 4 Retailer (page 88) client count from 12 to 63 in 2020, Pitney Bowes just passed DHL and their 32 top 1000 E-Retailer count to move to number four on the list. Volumes are now near levels the company had previously suggested operations could become profitable. But due to a deluge of one-time and unabsorbed costs, the segment is still not profitable. Some costs are COVID related. Some come from unabsorbed warehouse facilities. Others reflect lower operational efficiency than one would expect from a scaled operation. But despite the fact profitability has been pushed out a bit, the company has clearly done the right thing for itself, by doing the right thing for its customers. Accordingly, it is likely to keep these customers, and there is little reason to suggest profitability cannot improve over time as previously envisioned.  


TLDR: People think it's a mail meter stock but shipping is now more than half of their revenue and and they will soon be valued as a fast growing e-comm play.
