10,m6i91b,"So you had a bad day. Maybe your portfolio took a hit or something happened at work. Here's how to deal with it, without being a dick to your loved ones. 

For starters, acknowledge that you're probably going to be touchy, things might set you off. So you're going to need to destress.

Go home, eat a snack, kiss your wife or hug your kids. Now go and do something nice for them. Take out the trash, empty the dish washer, do some chore that you've been putting off. It'll help. I don't know why it helps, but it does.

I think out ape brains can't really weight things objectively so getting a small win offsets a greater loss. 

Now, do something for you or just relax. It is what it is. If your partner wants to talk about it, talk with them. But you don't have to fix it today.

**What this means is that there are 140,000+ call options that can be exercised at or near $10 this Friday 3/19.** To put this in context that's about 1000% more than the open interest in contracts expiring the following month. If the price reaches $10 and these contracts are exercised it will trigger the mother of all squeezes as each contract exercised will be a buy order of 100 shares. The more people buy the stock, the more it goes up...ape understand?

43,m6if56," **TLDR** \- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

At 16 March 2021.

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&amp;P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).

50,m6ih6d,"No advice will be found here, just one apes thoughts who buys high and sells low.

Now imma tell this as I understand it, please do correct me if I'm wrong. Also explaining this also helps me to understand it.

Imagine one share is equal to one 🍌, we can understand that. Now, the 🌈🐻 see those Gamestop shares as mouldy 🍌, so they think that they will be worthless and decided to say to Gamestop, ""We'll buy those 🍌 now"" back in 2020 when this all started, with an agreement that they would sell those exact 🍌back to Gamestop in the future for a lower value. (That's how a short works).

Now the man, myth and not cat [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) comes in and sees that actually its just a mouldy skin on the 🍌and the inside is pure gold. He decides he wants to buy lots of the mouldy 🍌because he sees their deep fucking value. He posts some of his findings on the 🍌 forums and people are excited and want to buy gold 🍌.

Now it's January and lots of apes are buying many 🍌 that hopefully will be gold inside, but they're not sure. The deadline for the 🌈🐻 to return those mouldy 🍌 for less, is fast approaching, but they already sold their mouldy 🍌 to make their gains when they first bought them. But with all the potential of these being gold 🍌 , there are no 🍌 left in the gamestop shop. 🌈🐻 are now scared.

Apes started to peel open their 🍌 around Jan w/c 25th. Apes would've made big tendies if apes opened 🍌 then. 🌈🐻 would have been able to buy them all back but at a significant loss which 🌈🐻 get angry about because 🌈🐻 are very fragile inside.

&amp;#x200B;

[Take a peek](https://i.redd.it/s1m86qnb8gn61.gif)

Angry 🌈🐻 decide to shut all the shops where apes can buy 🍌. This stops the apes from opening their 🍌and the belief that they are *actually* gold inside fades away. Meanwhile, 🌈🐻 go to another shop and start buying normal 🍌 which are not definitely not gold inside but look like the mouldy 🍌all the apes want. (This is why the float % is above 100%, because there are fake gold 🍌 in the market.)

Now this gives some time for the 🌈🐻 to be able to buy back the original 🍌 as the belief and price of all the 🍌falls. Some of the chimps sell their potential gold 🍌because they are scared that they might not actually be real gold inside, lowering the price even more.

Meanwhile, king ape [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) is being threatened with ape jail because he made🌈🐻 angry. King ape has big balls and still believes they are gold inside and doubles the amount of 🍌 he has. Apes go mad and start to buy more 🍌 whether they are gold or not. 🍌are good for apes, even if they are not gold inside.

Whilst 🌈🐻 are trying to find the real gold 🍌that they promised to give back in their first trade they keep promising more and more and more to buy themselves some time. Well the people who regulate the shops we buy 🍌from are started to get pissed of by 🌈🐻 being angry and breaking stuff. So they propose to change the rules so that the 🌈🐻 MUST give back the original 🍌within a much shorter period (previously 21 days, potentially 2 days if upcoming changes pass).

🌈🐻 have many tricks in their fur, they can roar at ape like ' 🍌ARE BAD', 'DONT BUY 🍌', 'WE ALREADY CLOSED (covered) OUR ORIGINAL TRADE'. Well, ape is dumb but no moron, why would 🌈🐻still be angry and shouting if they had fixed their problem? Ape smells bearshit.

A culmination of king big balls [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/), 🌈🐻 getting more angry, many fake ape bots saying 🍌are not good, the regulators of 🍌shop changing the rules, ape president giving money to 80% of apes so they could buy more 🍌, papa Cohen hired into 🍌 growing company, all point towards this not being over and there are still gold 🍌 in the market that the 🌈🐻 really really need.

Apes start to hear rumour that papa Cohen might lead the 🍌 growing company, and that 🍌growing company is about to release its earnings over the Christmas holidays (Remember how all those next gen consoles got sold out), and that 🍌growing company might recall all of those original bananas to hold an ape meeting. If original 🍌 are recalled then 🌈🐻 MUST find them, and will involve them buying many 🍌 to get them to their ape owners.

🌈🐻 Are getting very angry and running out of tactics to make apes let go of 🍌. But guess what? Ape loves 🍌 more than ever. Ape enjoys 🌈🐻being angry, because 🌈🐻 fucked many ape families years ago.

Some smooth brained apes think they could sell their 🍌for a good price now to buy MORE 🍌later. Well what if ape sold some of those gold 🍌? and instead bought mouldy ones later?

If any of these situations arose where 🌈🐻 need to find the original 🍌, then 🌈🐻 is fuk because there are potentially up to 900% more 🍌than when this all started, and ape can demand what ape wants to sell their 🍌 for. Many apes want $1,000,000 for their 🍌, but the longer 🌈🐻take, then ape can ask for more.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ape if he has gold 🍌](https://preview.redd.it/7oqvkuft7gn61.png?width=3508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94c9d58303edc403a262c705d924cc6d26321ddc)

&amp;#x200B;

**What if** 🌈🐻 **hasn't got that much money to buy all 🍌for a milli each?**

Well then the shop regulators will sell all of the 🌈🐻 apples and oranges and pears to make sure they have enough for the 🍌.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What if they still don't have enough money?**

Then those regulators have a money printing machine and ape government has reserves for this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Ape loves 🍌. 🍌may be gold inside, so ape never letting go of 🍌he already has, only buying more. 🌈🐻 are angry are apes for winning.**

Please correct me if I made some mistakes or could add to my analogy. There are MANY smart apes in this treehouse, and I have learnt a lot from them in only a couple months. Be grateful.

**TLDR** \- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

At 16 March 2021.

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&amp;P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME from Zacks:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).

81,m6iptw,"Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don’t matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‘oh no I got caught’ fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that through knowing their history of breaches will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I’ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let’s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock’s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel’s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let’s see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine &amp; a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‘best execution’ for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn’t in this perior. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine &amp; Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 – August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC’s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‘system issue’ which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I’m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‘oh X didn’t know, they’re not trained!’ as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure&amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 – August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 – February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it’ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn’t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn’t give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

Vonage is a communications company offering voice, messaging, video and data capabilities across unified communications, contact centers and API’s.    The company was started in 1998 with a focus in VoIP,  and IPO’d in 2006.     

Currently, VG is in the process of transforming from the legacy consumer communications business to a CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) company. 
 
Prior to 2020 CPaaS sector was growing as companies focused on digital transformation and omni-channel customer engagement.   The pandemic further accelerated this trend with the need for enterprise communication tools to manage remote work. 
 
VG is not best of breed in its industry and does not have any unique functionality that leads me to believe it will substantially eat into the market share of the industry leaders.  However, the CPaaS total addressable market is growing rapidly so there is room for VG to grow, nonetheless.  
 
Avg daily volume 3.68m on 249 million shares outstanding with 97% owned by institutions.

BAND / 3.2b /343m / 49% /  9.1
VG.     /3.1b /1.25b.  / 6%  /   2.4

*I only picked standalone competitors but it is worth noting Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and other big players have offerings or are working on offerings in this space.
 
*The case for VG:*
As you can see above, the headline growth number for VG is ugly compared to other CPaaS players and the valuation on a P/S basis reflects that fact.   VG revenue compares favorably to Ring Central but has just one tenth the market cap at present.   Simply put, VG is not valued as a growth CPaaS company at present, but when you break down the earnings report, I believe there is a case to be made that it should.  VG has two main segments the legacy consumer segment and the VCP (communications platform). 
 
Legacy consumer segment revenues were 333 million for FY20, a decrease of 14% yoy and is expected to continue decline over the next few years.   VG thoroughly investigated selling this segment but has opted against it.  This business is profitable, and the cash generation will help to fund continued investment into their new offerings.  Nonetheless, the decline in this segment is a drag on earnings.
 
Looking at the VCP segment is a different picture altogether.   FY2020 for VCP revenues were 856m, a 19% increase.  Further, the VCP API segment, the highest value segment grew at 33% and is expected to grow 34-36% in 1Q21.   Overall VCP segment revenue grew to 76% of total revenue from 70% prior year.   The CPaaS business is clearly becoming the dominant business within VG and is much healthier than the headline numbers would indicate.   Additionally, VG has been working on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses while investing in their new offerings.  
 
I believe VG is due to be revalued as a CPaaS company,  with a higher P/S multiple than it currently has.   VG management agrees, and this quarter they have started to report earnings in a way that highlights the strength of the VCP business.  Management also noted they will be focusing on driving Rule of 40 metrics (revenue growth + margin &gt; 40) which is a common measure for SaaS companies.
 
FY21 VCP segment revenues are projected at just over 1b alone and total VG revenues expected 1.32b.   Discounting the entire legacy business, a P/s of 5 on 2021 VCP revenues alone would be a 40% increase from current prices. 
 
8Risk:*
The primary risk is execution risk as VG builds out its newer business.  Margins are currently below industry SaaS and CPaaS leaders and management needs to continue to manage expenses while growing the business. 

Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are both neutral and of the opinion that this story may take multiple quarters to play out but are encouraged by the plan.     Avg Price target is $15.36 by 15 analysts (6 strong buy, 4 buy, 5 hold).
 
This is a space with tons of new competition and missteps could result in a lagging position that is difficult to rebound from.
 
*My Plan:*
As this is a turnaround / transformation play, I do not expect out/under performance without VG specific news or earnings reports.   8/20 13c $1.45 would allow me to capture 2 earnings reports to see confirmation or rejection of my thesis with minimal risk.  
 
Let me know what you all think!

TLDR: Vonage is a CPaaS company priced like a more like traditional telecom due to its declining legacy business.  This will change as their transformation continues to progress.",DD on Vonage Holding Corp (VG),1.0,1615926894,Call_Me_Hurr1cane

Nokia Corporation (NOK)

Market Cap $24.2bn

52 week Range $2.34 to $9.79

This is no longer the company that produced mobile phones and it's a while (8 years) since they moved away from phones when selling the whole division. They are a seamless 5G platform supplier. In fact they are one of only two companies anywhere with the capability to supply a continuous end to end 5g network platform. The other company is Huawei (I shall not swear any more.)

The only issue with Nokia is that they are not forthcoming and the information released to the public very much underplays how well the company is progressing. Previously the opposite approach this has artificially boosted the share price but as the business moves forward this is holding the share price down....and for a very good reason. I have come to suspect, that from several conversations with people I know at large institutions (who avoided talking about Nokia at all costs) that some large positions are being built up stealthily. Previously such avoidance of talking about companies has resulted in SEC filings showing large purchases during the previous quarter. This may be the reason why they didn't dip too far below $4 during the recent market drop.

Back to where Nokia is really at.

About 88% of revenue comes from wireless network infrastructure and products and internet routing equipment. 10 years of acquisitions have seen the transformation into a leading wireless technology company. In 2016 the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent which included Bell Labs. This made them into a potential giant along side the 'H' company and Ericsson.

Powering its ASIC-powered base station and 5G platform with it's new artificial intelligence ReefShark semiconductor saves around 50% energy usage and makes the product cheaper to customers.

This product is the ideal solution for Mobile Virtual Network Operators. There are between 800 and 1200 worldwide. When software development catches up the big tech and social network companies will have their own wireless service running autonomously. There is potential in cities to bring a network up to an astounding capability of over 5Tbps (yes terabytes) that means each loop can have 5000 customers with 1Gbps service. Reefshark makes Nokia the top of the pile in this massive coming market. And unlike Ericsson it's all in house and no need for partners. The 'H' company is banned from a number of significant countries so Nokia is ideally placed to pick up that business.

Nokia are stripping fitter by reducing operating costs and will shed a few thousand jobs. This could save $500M a year. 

At $4.30 the shares are cheap. Apart from a few shrewd institutions Nokia is currently ignored by most of the Wall Street sharks. It's typical of the attitude towards an overseas based company. The institutions that have got the jump on building up their stake in Nokia will be celebrating by the end of the year when the rest of Wall Street wants a piece of the action. $8-$10 is what I am expecting.

The price has crept up every day for the past week and could gather more momentum as the company gets a real grip on their business. It all looks good to me.",NOK DD,1.0,1615926905,nin0miku

98,m6it1n,"I jumped in after the wave and hold both GME and AMC—it occurred to me that while GME could probably survive a Reddit dump, AMC seems to be at such a tipping point that if everyone got out, the company would probably go under. 

I don’t really have a question or suggestion, it’s just crazy to think that a group of people could essentially liquidate a company on a whim. 

We wield power these days. It’s kind of crazy if you step back and look at it.",From a retard looking at the AMC situation: are redditors completely propping up this company?,1.0,1615927123,TheWhooooBuddies
