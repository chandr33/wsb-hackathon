I have been in stock market enough to spot this kind of manipulations. You should know that Yahoo Finance and other go to financial news websites are the greatest manipulation tools for Hedge Funds. They use it everyday to steer the retail investors. An analyst rating is one of the tools. When news like this drops, the institutions gear up to take profit and take opposite positions to capitalize on the long run. Financial news websites and analysts are paid big to release this kind of articles. They are trying to do this with AMC too. Who is this god's earth really thinks AMC is worth 1 cent? This is the new level of low institution and this particular analyst is trying to go to for manipulation. 

This is actually very good news. We are seeing desperations now. I am not a financial advisor. Just a very experienced retard in the stock market. Do your own DD. You will find it yourself, you don't need to listen to me.

What is the S-S-R Rule?  The short-sale rule or S-S-R, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The S-S-R restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the S-S-R remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after.
