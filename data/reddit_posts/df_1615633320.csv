2,m44798,"Author's note: the year is 2027. Peace on earth is imminent.  Equality for all is becoming a reality.  The year where no longer does every statement made have to be preceded by ""this is not financial advice"" but alas, we are but in the year 2021 and therefore I shall declare just that: ""this is not financial advice"".

""Is it possible to buy the new Tesla model Plaid LS Plus outright?"", asked Peter inquisitively.
""Sure but it's pretty expensive in these tough times, at about 0.03 $GME.  Are you still sure about getting  it?"", quizzes Sarah, Peter's wife's boyfriend's second daughter.
""Do I look like a 🌈🐻 to you ahah?"", he says with a hint of seriousness in his expression.
""No you're right, it's just that since Melvin Capital went bankrupt and $GME became the official currency everything seems so crazy..."" she retorts.
""...No I get it, thank God though that DFV was just elected President of the world, he's going to make everything awesome"".
""God that DFV guy, what a hero. Remember they had to expand the set of real numbers to accomodate his bank balance? "", Sarah laughs.
""Yeah what a legend!"", Peter replies with a look resembling that of a young child on Christmas day.

*Momentarily the pair of them look over at the corner of the room to see a familiar face on CNBC*
""... look $GME is going to zero... there's no way... just because Gamestop overtook Amazon doesn't mean they're not going to zero Richard...""


""Some things just never change Sarah, there's a lesson to be had, now let's go and get this Tesla for your father"".
""Sure, let's go"", Sarah's eyes twinkled. She was so proud to have a genuine retard 🦍 in her life, so many weren't so lucky.

47,m44ydw,"Hi Friends ,
I’ve seen recently seen posts about AMC to 1k and AMC to 2k so I decided to share my analysis of the situation.I appreciate all the enthusiasm but to be realistic I don’t think AMC have the potential to go up that much ( I might be wrong ). The reason is the AMC have issues more shares since 27th January after it jumper 300% in one day and free float increased from around 54 million shares to 284 million shares which is huge dilution. If this didn’t happen I am very sure AMC will be trading at 100$+ right now. I honestly think the AMC management have fucked up retail investors by this move unlike GME even when price hit 480$ they never issued more share. Because of this huge dilution the potential of squeeze is faded thanks to AMC management and in the mean while CEO taking million of dollars in bonuses by giving himself credit of erasing debt and raising more capital. I honestly think he should have waited until AMC had reached at 200$ then he could have issued more shares and raised more capital at the same time not screwing Reddit investors. I really appreciate the enthusiasm behind AMC to 1k but this is far from reality and would never happen. I am Holding 50,000 AMC shares at 8$ average.",AMC To 1000$,1.0,1615636850,arkh94

64,m455ey,"Every move we make, the HF's know what we are doing. They have infinite money and resources to profit and inflict pain on us. But this week we have stimulus money. Billions worth. 

So lets look at some negatives first:

• It's really nice out so people will sell and go do other things with their lives.

• HF's know the money is coming and can set traps for us.

• Friday could be a giant toilet for us if the HF trap crushes us. 

• People who have limit sells is what starts the chain reaction of the price dropping 200 points. 

Now the positives.

Supposedly Friday a lot of calls are expiring. I don't know if that really does anything for us. What we need is someone like Elon to dump 1B into GME. Calls expiring neither helps the volume or cash into the system. It just smells like a trap, but we have $1400 x the number of apes here. 

What are your realisitic thoughts on this week and 'best guess' on what will happen? 

One thing of note: Apparently calls expire at 3:00 on Friday, and typically the stock seems to fall when the calls expire. So knowing this, it might be best to make any major decisions by 2:57pm. Just my 2 cents.

I am considering LEAPs, as this is not a current feature of their app. However, it would immediately allow a video creator to mint and NFT for their video. I am thinking of all the viral videos out there that are very difficult to monetize, being easy to monetize and GPRO figuring a way to charge trxn/minting fees. I REAPEAT: this is not a current feature, but it seems like a no brainer connection for them and the extreme sports/stupid stunts area.

Anyone else think this has merit? LEAP calls are all less than $10 per contract so, like super ""cheap"".
