I've been making a decent chunk of money playing the Gamestop thing pretty well lately, but I've reached my limit of what I can take. It's fucking *painful* seeing some of your accounts get annihilated while people spread half-truths and lies and empty promises. So even though I'm going to share a dirty secret with you all, and probably ruin my most recent and most profitable trading strategy, **fuck it**. I just don't like seeing people get grifted -- even if these same people are downvoting me, calling me a shill, telling me to fuck off and educate myself and read whatever passes as ""DD"" nowadays, whatever. You need to know the truth.

And before someone comments on the suspicious nature of my profile, my original account has been shadow-boned from posting threads in WSB and mods never respond to my requests for threads to be approved. Mods can verify my other profile -- almost a decade old, with thousands of posts in WSB.

So, here's how hedgies are grifting you all out of a **LOT** of money:

* 1. Make a horrible short play, losing billions of dollars in money

* 2. Borrow funds to stay solvent

Needless to say, steps 1 and 2 aren't intentional and they've been covered in a lot of detail already, so I'll summarize: hedge funds shorting GME were squeezed when GME rose drastically in price. What caused the slow squeeze? Probably *not* WSB buying GME, since most people hopped in near the very peak and were eaten alive. WSB certainly contributed to the final and most dramatic part of the squeeze, but we all know what happened next: brokers pulled the plugs, and apes were left holding the bags. There *was* a genuine strategy here when retail were buying GME, and the only way the hedge funds could win was by playing dirty.

* 3. Realize the beast you unleashed is actually a (ba)boon
Hedge funds realized a beast had been created as nu-WSBers leaned into the ""dumb ape smoothbrain baboon"" jokes a *little* too far. These people -- largely millenials and zoomers who *hated* hedge funds for their role in the financial crisis, or for the state of the world today -- would do *anything* to stick it to the hedge funds -- even if it meant dousing their own savings in gasoline and lighting them on fire. The best part was that the majority of these traders were complete noobs to investing -- they [don't know that stocks often trade together](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbswiu/gme_and_amc_are_following_the_same_pattern/), they [believe wild conspiracy theories about short laddering, fake short float %s](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la9ymc/questions_on_short_float_short_ladder_attacks_and/), [they think there's an actual, genuine chance a stock can *actually* reach $130,000 a share and eclipse the GDP of Germany](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/), and they don't understand the difference between share price and market cap [place holder for proof coming shortly -- look for the bait].

* 4. Set up a gamma squeeze
Ahh, the hedge fund favorite -- the dreaded gamma squeeze! Both friend and foe of many favorites, such as TLRY, RIOT, LFIN, HYLN, SPCE, LTEA, and more! You'll notice some of these tickers don't even exist anymore. That doesn't matter -- they sure were a lot of fun when they were going up 120% over a day or two!

So what's a gamma squeeze? It's when people (by which I mean ‚Äúcorporations‚Äù) chain together call options, and exercise these call options sequentially, forcing market makers to hedge their positions by buying shares, which in turn raises the price of the stock and causes the OTM call options to be ATM/ITM, at which point *these* options will be exercised, causing an incredible feedback loop that causes the stock to rise just because it's *already* rising. Powerful stuff. For only a few million dollars, you can move billions of dollars' worth of stock. Impressive! But not something a rag-tag group of disheveled and disorganized investors could pull off -- as much as you'd like to believe it.

So what does this mean? This means that the hedge funds -- you know, the guys who were *shorting* the stock before -- suddenly own hundreds of thousands, and maybe even millions, of shares.

Heh, and these were the guys that WSB thinks are now ‚Äúshort.‚Äù

* 5. Convince people the ongoing gamma squeeze is actually a short squeeze

It's not hard to convince people what they *want* to hear! It doesn't matter that the short borrow rate was incredibly low -- that doesn't help our case! Giddy-up, confirmation bias! Distraction! Look at the short borrow availability. It's going up! That means shorts are exiting, that's good, that means the price will raise! Huzzah! Oh, now it's going down! That's even better! It just means there's more shorts to squeeze. Up is good, down is good. Green is good, red is good. Don‚Äôt ask questions, just hold.

* 6. Encourage people not to ever sell, except unrealistic lofty prices of 1k a share, 10k a share, 100k a share

[Look at this fuckin' goofball again](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/). Point out a single other stock in the world that could have this valuation. I won't hold my breath. (This is the bait)

If you keep buying, and you never, *ever* sell, then the hedge funds can sell at *great* prices! If you don't have stop-losses set, then that is CASH MONEY for the hedges. That means selling pressure won't be *too* intense when these hedge funds offload their shares onto smoothbrain retail looking to ""buy the dip before this goes to $100,000 a share""

Don't worry, they won't think to ask questions about why short interest is going down at the same time that the stock is plummetting. (Important reflection question: ""Who's selling, then?"")

* 7. Spread disinformation

Dumb ape smoothbrain nu-WSB retail investors don't know the difference between fact and fiction. Lean into that. Make up terms if they make GME sound like a good buy. Play up bullshit that others came up with. Some of this stuff is too hard to understand (by design!). Who will ever bother verifying all of these specious claims? **If it sounds good, it is good**. And if someone asks for a source? **Fuck sources**. We got upvotes! We got HYPE! We got smoothbrains! Short fees are low so they're just *made up*! Synthetic shorts obscure the *real* short rate! Ladder attacks are *real*, and they show that hedge funds are *desperate*!

(Claims about anti-GME bots spamming the megathreads, no proof ever provided)[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5jn1y/gme_megathread_for_march_15_2021/gr0vvt4/] -- This is just one of MANY examples I've seen of people whining about bots lately. Yes, there *were* bot shills months ago -- trying to divert attention away from GME and AMC and towards NOK -- but I honestly haven't seen *any* anti-GME bots over the past few weeks -- just regular folk trying to warn you retards not to be so damn retarded.

* 8. Astroturf positive sentiment

Now we just gotta hire some content creators on the cheap, buy some upvotes, and give hundreds of awards to these posts.

[Look how much of a killing we‚Äôve been able to make, lately! We borrowed a TON of money at *incredibly* low rates. This shows that investors have a lot of faith in our business, big banks have faith in us, and at interest rates of less than 4%, using this cash to turn a profit is the second easiest thing in the world! What‚Äôs the first easiest, you ask? Tricking a bunch of noob investors that this is somehow a bad thing for us, lol]( https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5tin0/citadel_borrows_600000000_thats_600_million/)

[Look at this fucking DD lmao. It doesn‚Äôt even need to *say* anything. Just use a bunch of technical terms, crop important information out of the graph, and no one will be any wiser. They won‚Äôt even realize CoastalHotDog835‚Äôs account is only one month old!]( https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m17zsb/gme_dd_technical_analysis_shows_very_strong_buy/) ‚Äì I actually tried to reproduce the MACD stuff using different candlestick lengths, and I just *can‚Äôt* get it to align. My suspicion is that they found a graph that *kind of* looks like GME, or they spliced together two images to present a false narrative.

This one ‚Äì also posted by CoastlHotDog835 -- is my favorite though. Fucking [ETF CLOAKING](https://postimg.cc/64VQ26WX). He just made up a term, posted a bunch of nonsense bullshit that is completely devoid of fact, and hopped aboard the upvote express. Dude definitely got a nice bonus check for this one.

[What‚Äôs better than astroturfing an old fave board? How about we just create/take over a new one! I bet people won‚Äôt even realize how many of the mods here have brand new accounts and don‚Äôt post about anything other than GME lolol](https://postimg.cc/GHSQgbPK)

In the general threads, comments with lots of diamonds, hands, rockets, and bold text have tested well with focus groups:

[1 month old account, thousands of posts in WSB alone shilling GME](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5jn1y/gme_megathread_for_march_15_2021/gr10wcp/)

[Another one of the same](https://old.reddit.com/user/Rooty_tooty111)

[There's tons of accounts like this](https://old.reddit.com/user/Fistijack61)

Speaking of which, can anyone find that extremely high-quality Gamestop ""300"" parody animation video posted a few days ago by a brand new account with no other posts? Yeah, me neither. Shit seems to just have disappeared. If you can find it, please post in the comments section so we can all see how ""totally legitimate for real guys"" his account is.

* 9. Mock WSBers by calling them smooth brains, apes, and telling them they're really sticking it to the hedge funds

This is dramatic irony. The apes are the puppets, and they have no idea that they're performing their role *perfectly*.

* 10. Drop your bags you've acquired from the gamma squeeze at a sexy price, and profit

While you're selling, don't forget to keep those dumb apes to hold. Check out the plummet last week from $330, and again today from $270. You think that‚Äôs organic market action? That‚Äôs the gamma squeezers cashing in their shares.

* 11. Have the last laugh as you walk away with billions and leave those shitty retail traders you hate so much holding the bag

Revenge is sweet, so they say.

---

So what now? Do you think critically about what I said? Acknowledge that hedge funds are behind this gamma squeeze, that there are no fundamentals for a short squeeze, and that there is a **massive** hedgie-supported campaign to generate positive sentiment towards GME?

Or... do you call me a retard and downvote the post, and offer no counter-argument?

Are you buying because you want to make money? Or are you buying because you want to ""stick it to the hedgies""?

If it's the former, then good luck -- that's all I can wish you. Plan an exit and be lucky. If it's the latter, then the most damage you can do is by selling.

85,m699ka,"I may be slow and a little retarded and an ape but it just hit me while sitting in the bath, waiting for the market to open. 

This is literally an epic, last, winner take all battle of the masses of planet earth. It is the super rich, trying to get richer, and lying and cheating their way there. Trying to solidify their place as rulers of the market. Then there is the rest of us. And there are millions of us around the world. Maybe billions if this keeps going.  

We are fed up and pissed off of the wealth inequality. It makes no sense why billionaires make the rules. We have become a two class society and it‚Äôs becoming more split every day.  We are armed with our savings and small disposable income we may have.  The US Government just gave us more ammo to fuel this fight. 

I know I‚Äôm holding. There‚Äôs way more to lose than whatever gains I might have right now.",This is truly a fight of the rich vs the poor masses,0.92,1615901951,JakeFromMontana
