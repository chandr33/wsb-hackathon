 I'm not a financial advisor, just a retard YOLO'ing my savings into long calls, so make your own decisions. 

 **Direxion Daily Aerospace &amp; Defense Bull 3X Shares** seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace &amp; Defense Index. 

TRUMP well he pretty much ignored war and focused on golfing so today with Biden in power, the war machine starts up again, the war budget for 2021 is up 1B$ and that means many companies in this ETF will make bank.

| Howmet Aerospace 3.54 |27|30|
| Textron 3.51 |50|52|

if you check the main companies in the ETF they are all currently undervalued compared to historical data. 

EX Boeing was trading at \~336$ in Feb 2020, now around \~224 with a nice recovery curve

 Lockheed Martin was \~440 now 340

&amp;#x200B;

when they recover this etf is going to the moon! 

Sure you could invest in airline ETF like JETS but, air lines are luxury companies, and don't profit much. When this virus is over what are we going to see Travel and lots of it, so demand for airplanes will skyrocket, demand for oil will go up even more so pressure to control oil producing countries will also increase. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR : DFEN is undervalued because the companies held by it have not recovered yet, USA is getting ready to swing its dick all over the place and money is going to pour into defense companies.
