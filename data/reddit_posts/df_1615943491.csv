Zomedica is an animal health company focused on meeting the needs of clinical veterinarians in ways that promote both patient and practice health. Our mission is to advance the effectiveness and financial well-being of veterinary practitioners by delivering professionally beneficial diagnostic products and services.

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

*I´m a noob so please* *don´t defenestrate this* *I would very much like to hear your opinions about the stock.*

**TRUFORMA main product and homerun winner:**

Truforma is a point-of-care device meant to deliver testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Truforma uses ""Bulk Acoustic Wave"" (BAW) technology which they claim provides accurate and repeatable test results. It offers complete control over the testing process from start to finish, with highly sensitive and specific immunoassays that allow veterinarians to make clinical decisions faster.

The immunoassays deliver accurate, reliable data when testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Assay performance metrics to determine specificity and sensitivity were determined with the goal of meeting or exceeding the stringent testing standards found in a reference lab setting.  

The process on how to use it is simple:

1) Obtain a Sample

2) Add the Sample to the Cartridge

3) Insert the Cartridge into Truforma

4) Results will be provided in 20 minutes or less on average.

**Zomedica Announces First Commercial Sale of Its Truforma® Platform:**

The first official purchaser of a TRUFORMA® system was Jason Berg, DVM, DACVIM, founder and president of Guardian Veterinary Specialists, a 29,000-square-foot advanced emergency critical care and specialty hospital in Brewster, New York.

Dr. Berg commented that “As a veterinary internist and business owner, I have devoted myself to advancing the practice of veterinary internal medicine and delivering care with a difference – doing more, providing more, and caring more. I am excited to be the first veterinarian to purchase TRUFORMA®. I will be able to go above and beyond the current standard of care to provide cutting-edge and novel testing to pet owners and veterinarians in seven surrounding counties across two states.

**My opinion on this:**

Potential competitors include large veterinary diagnosis companies, small businesses focused on animal health, reference laboratory services provided by academic institutions, and in-clinic products providers. Some of these are Idexx Laboratories Inc., Antech Diagnostics, Abaxis Inc., just to name a few. These are way bigger and although they don’t have something like Truforma, they have the assets to compete and maybe win. 

Having said this, I predict two outcomes, one is that the company will have a nice growth in the short term, with nice profit potential but not a good long term. If this gets bought by one of its competitors, then we can see a massive price increase on the stock. Why do I think this can get bought? It´s cheaper for the competition to buy than to develop. Idexx currently has over a 43B market cap.

Also, if the first buyer bought one unit for a 29,000-square-foot, then I don´t know how many units might be sold.

I´m betting on this for the short term, with this cutting-edge technology, my price target is at 4.6, about a 100% upside.

Elliot Wave Theory

&amp;#x200B;

Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064

Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf

Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb

Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January 

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec

What actually happened after that ""prediction""?

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f

Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b

🚀 Pre-Launch

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",GME is just getting started!!!,1.0,1615943776,saliym1988

DD on Porsche POAHY

The price per share is cheap right now at under $10 do it is easy to enter now and get a good amount of shares. So anyone can aqquire some, if you use the stockpile stock trading app like i do then u can even buy fractional shares of less than $10. 

Now i know that Porsche is a luxury item, but i feel that the Luxuries category will rise as covid goes down and businesses open up and people go back to work. If people are working then they will start buying more Luxuries with their increased income. 

Porsche is a Luxury Brand with a legacy.

This year so far the stock has risen over 150% in value and comes with a 2.63% dividend even.

I like Porsche cars and the stock is cheap enough for me to get alot of them. Im not a financial dude, i just like Porsche and think it may be a great stock to ride the wave of the world going back to work.

So I listened to you monkes and bought RKT.
Then I listened again and bought some UWMC.

Now UWMC is sitting low right now, and expectations are plain that it’ll recover with magnificent green for anyone HODLing like a good boy. And UWMC is coming out of the RKT little trade dispute claiming victory. And their graph looks promising, since the expectation is it’ll go back up, then keep growing because why wouldn’t it? Unless their ultimatum doesn’t pan out how they hoped it would?

But RKT isn’t just going to go out of business. Their stock price is lowish, and maybe they lost some market share to UWMC after that ultimatum. But odds are they’ll recover; or at least won’t go broke immediately. They don’t announce their next earnings until May, so we won’t know for sure how this pans out for a little while. But here’s the thing. As of a week ago, with the previous earnings report, RKT has an EPS higher than the price. That gives it a P/E of &lt;1 as of writing. And that means it *should* go up.

Look at any other stock. Their P/E, specifically. You’ll see 10, 20, 50. Bought TSLA? That’s 1000x P/E. That means that the stock price is that many *times* higher than that percentage of the company is profitable. Higher P/E values are irrational, and represent investors expecting the company to grow to meet that number. Except for insane stocks like TSLA, because growing that much is impossible. But big numbers are fun, and TSLA attracts the nuts, so fine. TSLA is a rollercoaster. Just, perhaps, a rickety one.

Now look at UWMC. Their P/E is 0, because their EPS is negative. They are losing money, they are unprofitable. This is not a good thing for a company to be. Without outside assistance or major internal change, they’ll run out of money eventually and go out of business. Unless they’re a growth stock in a new company, in which case those negative earnings represent the “start up time”; getting the ball rolling costs; once it gets going, it pays off. And guess what, UWMC *is* growing, so hey there might be something to that.

But RKT? They are objectively undervalued. And while the stock market is generally understood to be irrational, it will, occasionally, pass through the rational values to get to other irrational values. Moreover, it’s generally irrational *up*, not *down*.

Point is, UWMC should go up because it’s a growing company, and may *hopefully soon* become profitable.

Meanwhile, RKT should also go up, because it is *actually* profitable *and* undervalued right now.

So *why not both*?

In my opinion you could easily throw darts on a dartboard and have similar results to magic crayon geometric TA. Your two options are the market goes up or the market goes down, so you could also flip a coin. 

However, while doing my usual rounds tonight checking charts I noticed an after hours gap move and a pattern I wanted to share with you which could indicate downward movement. 

Top chart is VIX futures, bottom chart is SPY futures. Take note of these artifacts: 

* VIX Futures opened up +4 points (indicating volatility which indicates downward market pressure). 
* The last major gap like that is the right-most large yellow line (2/16/2021). 
* That last large VIX gap up on 2/16 resulted in the previous week long dip. 
* This also coincides with a spike in the Open Interest indicator which just spiked again along with the gap up. 

Further historical analysis going back to September does not show a large gap up after hours, but does show that spikes in VIX OI precedes both large and small dips on SPY and spikes in VIX. Closing thoughts after the graphic. 

For the smooth brains in the crowd I have included directional arrows on the VIX and SPY charts to show you which way the charts might move in the next 1-5 days.

It's been known for a while now that the market seems to tank whenever JPWO speaks. JPOW is speaking tomorrow. I'm not going to speculate on anything else, but there is some chatter in the daily thread about inflation, bonds etc. The market in general is at ATH and shaky all around. 

I think that the play tomorrow is going to be SPY puts and VXX calls. One could hedge buy buying contracts further out, a few select inverse contracts if SPY rages past 400. Realize however this is all speculative and it's inherently TA which as I said in the beginning is in my opinion not reliable.

As per tradition, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.  My positions are mostly cash, it's good to take profits when the market is up. I'm waiting for a good correction or good prices on individual stocks to DCA in. 

Currently I'm holding shares for FSR, BUZZ, GME. I'm waiting to get into SPCE and PLTR at better prices. Options are several VXX calls at different strikes at expirations, SPY 390P 3/17. Depending on premarket tomorrow I may still open a couple of OTM SPY 400C just in case.

91,m6p4rq,"I joined Reddit 44 days ago because I read an article about what happened with GME in January.  I wanted to learn more.  I read and read and read.  Admittedly I didn’t always understand everything I read so I Googled, YouTubed, and read more.  

On March 3rd I bought 54 shares of GME for $125/share.  By the time I was done with a shower, the stock was down $7.  I panicked and sold.  I literally owned the stock for less than 1 hour.  Yeah, I know.  Toilet paper hands!

Then I read and read and read some more.  I started watching Bloomberg, CNBC, fox business, etc.  and I kept reading.

Three things convinced me.

1.  Massive amounts of DD by extraordinarily talented smart Apes

2.  The community effect - no ONE is as smart as EVERYONE.  The idea that 1,000s or 10,000s or 100,000s or even 1,000,000s could be drastically wrong doesn’t make sense when coupled with awesome DD

3.  The Media.  If you are a Karen or Ken who believes media outlets are a place to get truth, this isn’t for you.  The Media is owned and orchestrated by money and only money.  Nothing else.  And the Media has consistently misreported and outright lied about what has happened and what is happening with GME, this Reddit community, HFs and our Gov’t.  Combine this with 1 and 2 and the truth was clear to me

I believe this is 2008 again.  Lots of people know.  No one wants the truth to come out as it will crush HFs, some investment banks and brokerages.  The cascade could/will impact the markets in total and it will require gov’t intervention.  But...(a) THIS IS THE WAY the system can be fixed in some important ways that have been screwing everyone except mega-rich (e.g., naked shorts, ability to short even with SSR in place, manipulation with high frequency trading, etc) and (B) THIS IS THE WAY a lot of brave little guys get to table turn and make a buck!

TLDR:  I bought 76 shares on 3/6 for $140.  I’ve been adding since.  Today I have 220 shares averaging $219.  I have multiple limit buy orders to buy dips.  I will NEVER sell until we are $2M+.  

Point of the story:  if you are a newcomer, and you decide to jump in based on your own DD and certainly not because of anything I am sharing as I pick my butt and sniff my fingers while eating crayons, buy and HOLD.  It won’t be easy with the wild swings.  Check in with the Ape community for morale support.  This is a great pride of apes that have shown each other tremendous support!
