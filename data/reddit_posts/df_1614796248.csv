But when I tried to post an update, it kept getting automodded.

As an update: I took profits on my last play and am now re-allocating them. This is my 1st new play.

&amp;#x200B;

$NOK got a LOT of love when the first $GME spike happened. It got so much love that it popped to nearly 10$/share before RH blocked trading.

Since then, volume's come down, attention has gone away from the stock, this has made options quite appealing.

IV's down significantly and calls are REALLY cheap.

My DD:

* They delivered SOLID Q4 and 2020 earnings, even though it was a tough year in general.
* The company owns the **most** pattents in the 5G space of all it's peers.
* Huauei is being blacklisted in most of the western world, there are only 2 players remaining in the space, Ericcson and Nokia.
* The company is sitting on nearly $8 billion in cash and generates over a billion a year in free cash flow.
* The stock is trading at only 1.5x book value
* They have been increasing the profit margins significantly for the last 3 years and are working towards improving them even more.
* Nokia has announced several solid deals over the past few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The company is small enough that it could be an M&amp;A target** 
   * The US Attorney General William Barr [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-department-justices-china) the US -- either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies -- should purchase a controlling stake in either Nokia or Ericsson for access to secure 5G equipment. He said such a move could blunt the rise of China and Huawei in the space. 
   * AT&amp;T / Tmobile / another carrier could buy them to lower their own costs of updating to 5/6G.
   * Intel and Microsoft are both focusing heavily on the space and Microsoft already bought part of Nokia in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

* There's also the potential for them to reinstate their dividend payment policy.

&amp;#x200B;

* Average analyst price target is 5.75$
* Over the last 10 years, it's been rangebound between 4 and 8$, it's pretty much at the bottom of the range.
* I'm confident it'll be back to 5 or 6$ by the summer, especially if they keep announcing these solid deals.

Positions: 20 000 shares and 100x 6$ calls sold against them for april 16th.

TLDR: Nokia's a great medium-long term play, IV's down significantly, shares and calls are cheap. This will probably bounce from 4$ back towards 6-8$ over the medium term, or be bought out as a strategic play, likely for over 6$.

&amp;#x200B;

93,lx13n5,"**Pretext and hypotheticals:**

GameStop goes to +$150 before earnings (No MOASS trigger in this scenario)

GameStop has positive Q4 Earnings (Positive console launches, holiday season)

&gt;From the Q3 earnings report ([https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth))  
&gt;  
&gt;"" Due to the uncertainty around the duration and evolving impact of COVID-19, the Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter**.**  For fiscal November 2020, comparable store sales increased 16.5% and total net sales were $791.1 million compared to $747.6 million in fiscal November 2019. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;Also something not mentioned but I think could be relevant ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gamestop%20near%20me](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gamestop%20near%20me))  
&gt;  
&gt;Google trend for ""gamestop near me"" looks positive for holiday season (you can throw in target, bestbuy, etc for comparibles)

Now, market sentiment and technicals support 100% bullish all things gaming, per continued hypothetical

**What stocks will see the gains in the mad dash towards gaming?**

Ill start this retarded discussion by mentioning;

$EA (sports games monopoly)

$ATVI (overwatch porn)

$TTWO (GTA 6 cash cow)

$U (Unity software for VR anime titties)

$RBLX (Kids version of GTA 6, IPO)

$NVDA (all GPUs on GameStop's website still sold out)

$TSLA (When they ever roll out a dedicated GameStop App)

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mentions while I'm at it - I think golfing stocks ($GOLF $ELY $DS) might be good long holds because golf had an increase in players due to covid (kid in my weekly golf outings says 3x number of highschool tryouts this year) and increase in NBA popularity (nba and golf are hand in hand, plus CHINA DEMAND). If we become rich, we take over the golfing scene. If we don't, hedge funds will always be golfers. Also, NBA Top Shot collectibles (NFT bullshit) are in a crazy demand rn and that just dropped 2-3 months ago.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stocks.

Disclosure: I have a couple shares of most of them, but I am 85% in $GME and 10% in AMC (dip, dip, dip-a-delphia)
