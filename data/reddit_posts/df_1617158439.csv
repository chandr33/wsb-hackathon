In the coming months and years, I will be working alongside others to help bring honor to the Apes that have come before me, that have sacrificed themselves in order to preserve global financial markets that are of the Apes, by the Apes, and for the Apes so that a freedom of exchange, one that is uninhibited by manipulation and intervention, shall not perish from the face of the Earth. 

Bringing honor to the Apes requires a breaking down of the signals that reinforce market failures: analyst ratings. The new order must reignite the torch once held by the invisible hand. 

I'd like to introduce you to a potential successor: [**ApeRatings**](https://aperatings.com/). It analyzes Ape activities here and reports on it. It is therefore an order of the Apes, by the Apes, and for the Apes. It's not much today, but with a little time and effort, it can evolve into a modern day evergreen of the financial markets. 

It will be free indefinitely for all to consume. No login, no payments. I will even try my best to cover the cost of running the API once it is developed. Extend your support where possible, especially your ideas on data, analytics and metrics that you'd like to see in the future.  

Donations above and beyond the cost to build and operate the system will further support Apes by being set aside for investments in symbols identified by you (through ApeRatings) as top picks.

50,mgx2xi,"Need Analytic DD and Wrinkle Brains on this:

 So I came across this post earlier by ??? on r/GME asking if HFs were potentially using these short amounts to communicate back and forth during ladder shorts/ ladder buys. I know there has been an abundance of questions about why there are so many sell/buy orders back and forth  the order chain for weird amounts in rapid succession causing sharp drops or rises in price even with low volume (1, 4, 7, 10, 100...you get it).   What I want to know is: Is communicating like this really a thing? The article clearly says ‘folklore’ indicating a myth or something that’s probably not true, but what if they really are? Is this legal? This could explain so many of the seemingly coordinated momentum swings and flash crashes we’ve seen to cripple some large run ups in price. It also looks VERY VERY illegal and highly sus.   I have a few wrinkles but still fairly smooth brained with few resources at my disposal. Would it be possible to have a few serious wrinkle brain apes isolate sections of short ladder attacks we’ve seen over the past few months and extrapolate any patterns to try to pinpoint which institutions are likely making those kind of trades and if there are any connections that would indicate coordination or insider trading between those players? I think if the apes can build a solid case with enough data and evidence that major players are communicating through trades for all to see and clearly manipulating the markets, the SEC and DTCC will be forced to do something about it. Something this big I would like to believe would mean serious consequences and jail time. I know everyone has been screaming, “MANIPULATION! MANIPULATION!” but we’ve yet to actually see the smoking gun. Could this be it?  Anyway, I am not a financial adviser. I like the stock. I would like to hear your thoughts about this as it likely is not only GME, but all ticker symbols that are falling victim to this type of trading right under our noses. 🦍💪🏼💎🙌🏼🚀🚀🚀[Photo](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0HupXBpHxq-wWFSFX1uGZJweA)",Need serious DD and analytics on this topic,0.99,1617161101,Inevitable-Sir4572
