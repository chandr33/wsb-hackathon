10,lwz1n0,"So let me get this straight, you guys sold RKT for 70% profit to buy into GME. 

RKT is at 40% Short Interest, is less volatile because they have a working business model, and ACTUALLY makes money. 

GME has 60% Short Interest, is only moving because of a short interest fundamental, and it’s forward business model is based on pure speculation on whether or something not Ryan Cohen can turn it around, who hasn’t said anything on his plans to do so other than a few cryptic tweets. 

So let me get this straight, you idiots are dumping a WORKING company that makes money, has similar short interest %, issued a special one time dividend to incentivize holding SPECIFICALLY to fuck over the shorts, and has a cheaper stock price entry

for a company that has somewhat higher Short Interest and its future business is based on speculation. A company that almost a year ago claimed it was essential to the economy and wanted to stay open when everything was shutting down due to Covid and you monkeys made fun of them for doing so. 

You’re selling RKT for a profit, which helps short sellers because you don’t want to baghold yet you’re bagholding GME 

Just so you can sTIcK iT tO tHe heGiEs
