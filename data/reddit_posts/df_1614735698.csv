They‚Äôre the ones producing J&amp;J‚Äôs Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck &amp; Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they‚Äôve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we‚Äôll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&amp;J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it‚Äôll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Just so this doesn't get removed bc all of the links, I put all of the links on a post in my account. The link number in the post corresponds with the link in this post. Here is that post:

[https://www.reddit.com/user/HomeDepotHank69/comments/lwhwiw/links\_for\_gme\_dd\_compilation/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HomeDepotHank69/comments/lwhwiw/links_for_gme_dd_compilation/)

**THE ACTUAL POST:**

I‚Äôm sure many of you apes are in the same situation as me: smooth brain, ADHD meds, and wife‚Äôs boyfriend constantly forcing me to refresh the DD page when I could/should be masturbating to cuck porn. To help with this problem, I have made a compilation of all of the DD for GME that I could find. This is by no means complete, so please add more links in the comments. ENJOY.

**First post:** Here‚Äôs a link to the first DD that I did on GME, I still stand by everything I said in that. This covers prevois price action, volume, brokerages, etc: 

**SEE LINK 1**

**ETFs:** Hedge funds are massively shorting ETFs that contain GME or have a bearish sentiment in order to hide their positions, drive down the price, delay the squeeze, and make interest in GME decrease. Here are the links: 

**SEE LINK 2**

**Borrow Rate:** Use this link from iborrowdesk to see that the available short shares of GME are behaving similarly to last time and that the borrow rate is hiking. Similar data can be found on fintel, but this site gives you more data: 

**SEE LINK 3**

**Short interest:** As I said, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an accurate short interest number because the numbers are probably not being accurately reported, naked shorts, and ETFs leading to indirect shorting. Here are a bunch of posts on all that shit: 

**SEE LINK 4**

**Price action:** GME fractal pattern is repeating itself, which suggests that HFs keep trying to make it go down but it is resisting at every turn and is continuing to be bullish. My original post also has some information on price action.

**SEE LINK 5**

**Volume:** This is a great picture from someone on reddit, which shows how strangely similar volume and short interest are from January's squeeze to now. 

**SEE VOLUME PICTURE 1**

**Uncle Bruce:** Boomer who makes YouTube videos but is actually a smooth brain warrior with excellent insights about how some HFs are probably playing this long, which will only increase the price: 

**SEE LINK 6**

**VIX:** GME price spikes seem to be correlated with more volatility in the market as the VIX usually spikes and SPX drops precipitously (note that if you think buying calls on the VIX is a good idea because of this, I would think twice because this squeeze will likely take longer and theta decay will eat your ass on VIX calls in the process): 

**SEE LINK 7**

u/HeyItsPixeL: If you click on any of these links, click on this one. This is by far the best DD that I‚Äôve ever seen on WSB. In short, he talks about the likelihood of a gamma/short squeeze all pointing to a specific date (March 19) because of naked shorts and provides a MASSIVE amount of data for it: 

**SEE LINK 8**

**Catalysts and personal notes:** I echo everything that u/heyitspixel said in the above link. I also want to emphasize other potential catalysts such as earnings on March 26, possible acquisitions, AMC earnings tonight, Ryan Cohen tweets, DFV‚Äôs 500 april ITM calls, and Elon/Chamath/other celebrities tweeting about more interest in the stock. I cannot stress enough that I think this squeeze will take longer than the last one but will be bigger especially if us smooth brains continue to hold and buy. Right now, it seems that the HFs are building an extremely steep house of cards because of naked shorts that will eventually come tumbling down in an even bigger way than last time. They are trying to delay the squeeze so that people get bored and sell but all that it‚Äôs doing is building up the gas for the inevitable squeeze. I want to emphasize further than brokerages WILL be the end of this like they were last time, but I believe that because they have more liquidity and don‚Äôt want another media nightmare like last time, that they will let this last much longer. I also want to emphasize that their actions only have power if people actually do sell when they restrict buying. Finally, I want to emphasize heyitspixels sentiment that many other institutions seem to be long on this and want to profit from the squeeze as well, which only helps us. Right now, it seems like it‚Äôs WSB + some institution(s) v. HFs (Melvin, citadel, etc). Great posts about catalysts and future action: 

**SEE LINK 9**

**Finally, I want to address 2 common arguments that I keep seeing:**

1. ‚Äúthe squeeze is already squoze, this information is public, it‚Äôs not gonna happen again‚Äù ‚Äì to that I say, take a look at any post before the January squeeze and you will see the exact same shit. Based on the information I‚Äôve provided above, it‚Äôs hard to deny that another squeeze is not imminent, but if you wanna miss out, your brain is smoother than mine.
2. ‚ÄúNo way hedge funds will let this happen again, they learned from last time‚Äù ‚Äì to which I say, 2007 has entered the chat. If you really think that these guys learn from massive mistakes, your brain is smoother than silk. Most of these fuckers who are short are shorting out of rage and spite, which is making them act illogical. The fact that there is still AT LEAST 60% short interest on this after that massive squeeze shows that most of them didn‚Äôt cover and want to dig this thing into the ground. Don‚Äôt be na√Øve.

**Date:** I don't like when people give date predictions with no data, so I will be giving a range: March 17th - 31st. I say this because March 17th is 2 days before heyitspixel's prediction about the quadruple witching day on March 19th. March 25th is after hours earnings. I'm saying that it could happen at any time in this range because of the T-3 rule for exercising deliveries (because March 26th is a Friday, we might not see the full action until sometime that next week). There could be giant run ups before these dates, but if there are, they are not the full squeeze as I believe that the volume on and after earnings will be the highest, which will be the perfect time for the squeeze. In short, stay strong throughout this entire month. 

**Conclusion:** (This is from my first post). Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be and the date of March 19. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong. Yes, RKT and AMC look nice rn, but GME will be soooooooooo much bigger, so the potential gains for holding GME compared to AMC/RKT are not even comparable (I like those stocks, but I like GME infinitely more).

69,lwicsp,"So- I‚Äôm not saying RKT is a bad investment, I don‚Äôt know dick about it. THAT BEING SAID. I have noticed a disturbing amount of 1 year+ accounts with less than 100 karma, or accounta that were created in the last month that are dedicated to RKT shilling.

Below are some references, with anything on this sub, comment or post LOOK AT THE ACCOUNT OWNERS HISTORY. Just to see if they‚Äôre active, because accounts that are new/dedicated to shilling one thing/old with no comments

Are bought/bot accounts used to shill. Be very careful and question why exactly there is so much manufactured shilling for it. It doesn‚Äôt mean ignore opportunities, it just means be careful. I have puts.

Would probably do like 60% ETFs 20% stocks and 20% digital money

What long term ETFs would you invest in?

My thoughts are VTI or VOO, SPY, QQQ. Would also do ARKs probs for 5 years or 10 years and until they are tapped out.

What would you do? 

Thoughts?  In the end since id have to pay a 15% long term capital gains tax would the tax free 529 be better?

89,lwig5b,"**Step 1:** switch that ""hot"" button to sort by ""new""

**Step 2:** ignore all things that say GME,  or RKT, or whatever the next big thing is at that time

**step 3:** look at all other tickers, if they are related to GME or RKT rather then just dd in any way (mortgage company like rkt, heavily shorted for gme) ignore it they're likely just after the hype caused by the rush.

**Step 4**: You've found a stock, coo, now look at its financials what's its share holders equity what's its net income? what's its market value? and how much do you weigh each of these? that's a personal thing, a lot of people have taken the stance that fundamentals are useless now siting TSLA and the like but that's still the easiest way to sort through the shit if you ask me.

**Step 5:** look for news, what's the sentiment? what are the aims its going for and when is this going to be revealed? you want something that has a clear way to burst through the market OTHER THEN EARNINGS, earnings are nice but it needs a clear cut reason it should go off. RKT's PE ratio was insanely good for its sector and what it was making giving it a clear cut above the rest.

**Step 6:** buy in with a A PORTION of your money into a call/put/stock based on your own taste. the more your in the market, the more you'll understand what your looking for better. i personally like to aim for previous lows within a bullish run.

**Step 7: Profit? lmao probably not**, i said to use a portion cause everything i said can help give you a better shot but lets be real here, **your using a sub who calls each other autists and retards, that recently got swamped with people who have no real stock knowledge,  when we were already struggling in the knowledge department before hand lmao. GL, your fucked either way**

Edit: A lot of people are putting ""I followed this and found xxx stock"" and let me tell you i hate most of their financials, JS, yall got some shitty understandings of step 4-5.
