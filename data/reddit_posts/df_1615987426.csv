**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. 

Summary: 

1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. 
2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. 
3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. 
4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. 
5. The ""Minimum Exposure Point"" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",3/17/2021 GME Open Interest Report at Yesterday's Close of 208.14,1.0,1615988403,Unlucky_Falcon1754

99,m70t8t,"# Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February - [source](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-apha-options-data-report-2021-03/)

A lot of analysts are raising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"".

Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.

The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.

Two important dates:

April 14, voting on the merger takes place

On or about April 20, the merger is completed

I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.

I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.

# Possible plays:

1. Buy in low and sell before the merger if you're satisfied with the gains.
2. Buy in low or high as long as APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY share. For this option it doesn't matter how the price is as long as APHA is still the cheaper of the two AND it's 83.81% of a TLRY share.

Why 83.81%

Every APHA share held through the merger will be turned into .8381 of a TLRY share. So for example:

100 APHA

20 TLRY

20 + (100 x .8381) TLRY = 103 TLRY

83 TLRY merged from 100 APHA would cost (@ current price \~$19.3): $1,601.9

83 TLRY bough directly as TLRY would cost (@ current price \~$25.5) : $2,116.5

So you save $514.6 by buying APHA instead.

That math is true no matter how high the price of either gets. If TLRY becomes more expensive and APHA stays around the same, even better. If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company.

&amp;#x200B;

IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind.

# TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting. April 20, merger). Buy low, sell high. If long, only buy if APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY. If short, do whatever the fuck you want.

This is not financial advice.",APHA short interest down - possibly in preparation of something big,1.0,1615988929,redrocketinn
