15,m3ik63,"If we were to play out the events surrounding gme hypothetically.

A catalyst comes in, pushes gme toward the 800 share price, and it goes super nova.

The market makers hedge, pushing it even further, shorts cover at light speed. Halts occur every 5 minutes.

As the price sky rockets, the hedge funds will be forced to liquidate to cover their short positions, followed by their brokers, and then their brokers.

Essentially making GME a market black hole - starting the next financial market crash.

Now my question is, obviously the government/SEC would want to avoid a repeat of 2008 - so at what price point do you think they will step in?

$5,000? $10,000? $50,000?

I'm thinking maybe $10,000 to be conservative.

Also, how would they step in?

Im thinking they might just force GME management to do a capital raise and issue a billion new shares.

Anyways, thought this might be something interesting to think about as I haven't seen too many realistic takes on this

So I'm very confused on how pricing works in the stock market. I know it's supposed to be a reflection of supply and demand and somehow based on a companies actual performance, but what's the scaling supposed be between? What's the theoretical cap on a stock of an amazing company that everyone wants the stock of?

I was just minding my business and at some point a notification popped up on my phone that GME has reached the 300€ mark which I had set for notification so I just opened the app and what the fuck do I see!?

GME @12000€

I only have a measly 2 shares but for a few seconds I had 24000€ in my portfolio! Bedazzled by my new wealth I was too slow to sell, though, and it dropped back to ~200€ in a flash. Then I woke up from disappointment. But nevertheless it was a really nice feeling.

So is this a sign now? I strongly believe in it!

59,m3irkc,"So I've been trying for a few hours now. So I'm using this formula.

&amp;#x200B;

[PEG](https://preview.redd.it/5h17iahywlm61.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e4f211a78780529d2ffa9ea03ce071e28b826d)

So as far as I understand the PE is the top line. Price/Earning Per Share. 

[APPLE](https://preview.redd.it/49lkvwpnwlm61.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d118b40fe6eede55160d66762ea4acd1aba0a116)

Now AFAIK I need the EPS for 1 year open and close.

&amp;#x200B;

[#](https://preview.redd.it/c0mkx8fmxlm61.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44261e1924dd38f2f404230d5fbde6cab8946f8e)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t52lytqpxlm61.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68649f405a39d16297b3ac96d12e862ababd3c9e

So this is 1 year of the EPS 2019-2020 Dec 31st. To do the formula above I do this.  


(Current Stock Price / 2020 EPS) / ((thisYearsEarningsPerShare / lastYearsEarningPerShare) -1)

If I go on Yahoo Finance and look at $Appl I get a Trailing PEG (Which I belive is 1 year window) that looks like this.

  


https://preview.redd.it/7gt1qaifylm61.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=366d397ca0984cf6c9f09af40da8f3738c37602c

But when I use my formula in Python here:

 

    #$Appl
earningPerShare2020 = 3.72
price = 121.96
earningPerShare2019 = 3.06

def peg(currentStockPrice, thisYearsEarningsPerShare, lastYearsEarningPerShare):
    pe = currentStockPrice / thisYearsEarningsPerShare
    epsGrowth = (thisYearsEarningsPerShare / lastYearsEarningPerShare) -1
 return pe / epsGrowth
 
pegValue = peg(price, earningPerShare2020, earningPerShare2019)

print(""PEG: "", pegValue) #PEG:  152.00293255131956 

I get the answer 152.0029 for the PEG and I don't know where I'm going wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me? What have I done wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

91,m3iv7n,"I've been talking to my friends for the past few days about this, and I'd like for people to check if what I'm saying makes sense (because if it does, it makes me worry for my fellow retail investors/GME holders).

My thoughts:

- If these currently out-of-the-money call contracts become in the money, the risk the options writer takes is tremendously disproportionate to the premiums they are collecting.  For example, if someone exercises an $800 strike call they purchased for $2.35, the options writer stands to gain $235.00 premium for a risk of having to buy 100 shares at $800 each ($80,000).

- Why would anyone take this risk as an options writer?  My only reasoning I can come to is that the writer owns a tremendous amount of stock in GME.   If the writer bought in at $50, the writer can offload shares to profit and keep the price from rocketing.  It seems like that's what we witnessed with the stagnancy on Thursday (if there's no price movement up or down, options expire worthless today).

- My grand assumption (and fear) is that the institutions are writing the contracts, the institutions hold a lot of shares, and they will make sure these contracts expire worthless.
