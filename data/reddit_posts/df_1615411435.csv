8,m29259,"Okay retards. Here is what I think happened today while you were busy shitting out the crayons you had for lunch. 

Today's GME dip was clearly a short attack. Most likely manipulation based on the sketchy timing of some articles, but my point is independent on that. I think as fucked up as it is to hear this, some hedge funds won on this one and that can even be good for us. Hear me out before you start screaming like the apes we are. 

First, there is absolutely no way retail had anything to do with this. We sure as hell not didn't cause such a strong dip by paper handling coincidentally all of us all of a sudden,  this was an orchestrated short attack. The interesting part was how it bounced back. And I believe that again there is no way retail had anything to do with it. How much money do we really have left to fight such an enormous dip at this point? We are balls deep in already. We apes keep saying to each other ""BUY THE DIP"" but let's face it, we ain't got no money left to buy the damn deep. We have put everything we have and beg our wife's boyfriend to give us some ramen noodles for dinner. 

So here is what I think happened.

1) Short attack by hedge funds which caused many stop losses to be activated. They then covered back that short attack, making gains from panicked day traders, stop losses, algos that started selling and paper handed bitches. 

Or

2) The bounce back was again made by hedges, opposing ones this time. It's a war out of there and even though most hedge funds are owned and run by corrupt greedy douchebags, some of them are on our side, the long side of the trade. Or they have no skin in the direction of the game and simply like volatility. These are the ones that profited from today and fucked the shorts.

So what now my fellow gorillas? We view this as a good sign. Even if some hedge funds won, either the ones that shorted and profited like in case 1, or opposing hedge funds like case 2, what we want is high volatility. High volatility leads to more madness, more shorting and more chaos. This is what is gonna send us flying to the moon. We won't fly to Jupiter on a 5% day gain, we need the volatility. If you hate volatility go play boomer stocks.


TLDR Hedge funds are most likely at war. High volatility is good for us. GME to the moon.",Today's GME manipulation,1.0,1615411491,Enasakoma
9,m2926m,"When I was a young boy in Bulgaria, I fell in love with a lovely red-haired girl. She had this lovely monkey face, that I just couldn't resist. 

Eventually we grew up, and I was no longer a young boy in Bulgaria, but a full grown ape abroad. I married her, planning on having tons of monkeyape babies. We were happy and all was well, but something was missing. I felt like I wasn't with my people.

In a rare turn of events, I got into wallstreetbets. Here i found a second home, nay, a family I dare say. One thing led into another and I bought GME at $380. While doing so, my other half was keeping herself busy sucking her boyfriend's dick. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know things have been rough in the past few hours. A lot of you got scared, some lost their diamond hads, and even more realised their girlfrield found a 3rd boyfriend team-bag her with her other one. But it is okay. We are a strong ape family and we'll go through this together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now remember, it's okay to feel down when the Red hits hard. But do not fall into despair my retarded good ape.

12,m292oz,"So, some hedge fund attempted to manipulate the market today by selling 260,000 shares of GME at $240 - in one sales order (guaranteed not to fill immediately.)

He then waited 5 minutes.

He then sold another 500,000 shares after it dropped to $180.

So his $340 shares, which were worth $340 million suddenly dropped in value to $180 million, and so he decided to sell half of them after they tanked.

For the last few weeks I've been having severe tooth pain, and my appointment with the dentist to get it checked out was this morning. Right around the time $GME started taking off. 

https://imgur.com/a/H37HTMc

You can see in the photo how much of the tooth is hollowed out. He told me I need a root canal to save it. He went through the trouble of setting up an appointment for me at a specialist later in the month, but that wasn't the issue.

The issue was the 1300$ price tag, which I absolutely could not afford, and I knew it. And if I don't get the procedure done, that pain's going to get worse, and it's going to spread. Or even form an abscess, which can migrate to my brain and literally kill my stupid ass.

...The only way I could afford the operation is if I sold my gamestonks, ASAP. 

It did occur to me, I admit, to wait a little while, maybe even get double what I needed if it reached 500. But then that fucking...150$ drop. All at once. 

I'm so sorry. I've been diamond hands since before the peak in January, all the way through the 40$ lows, but today I didn't feel like I had any choice but to slip. Give 'em hell for me, apes. Maybe I'll be back if it dips low enough.","Well, fuck.",1.0,1615411950,Gray227
