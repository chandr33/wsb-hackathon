83,lw97cd,"My fellow apes, retards and so on. We all know what is coming within the next few weeks/ months.
The biggest, dirtiest, sexiest motherlicking squeeze of all time and we're all on board so here me out!

I know we all wanna see get the tendies, the monkeys wants their bananas yada yada.
So everyone who holds, everyone who's selling for the biggest profit in their life, everyone who wants to shove it up the ass of HF, let's not forget from where we came from.

We are the people, the small guy next door, the school kid wanting to buy a gaming PC, the mothers and fathers wanting to support their children, the millennials who wants to afford living a normal life without crippling depression and debts.

Let us, ALL OF US, give back after the squeeze. 
It doesn't matter if it's 1$/1€ or 100.000$/100.000€ but let us give something back. I don't know which charity or organisation but we can make an incredible impact, if all of us would donate for a greater cause.

I for myself would love to help the environment and endangered species.
Comment here for what all of the apes should donate and say the comment with the most upvotes is the winner.

Please not silly answers because it's something that should matter and make a difference.
