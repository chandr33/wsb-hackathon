But imo i think it has no  effect on the company’s value! Moreover. The recent divestment will give it even more cash and less debt to move forward for the 2nd biggest turnaround story (GeeMee 1st of course).

30,m20cet,"What's up degenerates,

I know you, your mom, and your sister are looking for plays right now so check out this undervalued gem. 

Nautilus is a health and fitness hardware and software company. They own the following brands: Nautilus, Schwinn, and Bowflex. While these brands provide a diverse product offering to different demographics, Bowflex is the real diamond in the rough. To explain in WSB; their bikes and treadmills compete with Peloton at a fraction of the price while also offering a lot more ""connected-fitness"" equipment that Peloton doesn't even have the infrastructure to build. Additionally, for the large demographic that can't afford a $2000 bike, Schwinn and Nautilus sell (unconnected) hardware starting at $399.  Bowflex's software (JRNY) is only in its infancy but scaling fast. 

Financials and valuation are not in-line with fair-value. The company trades at 1x sales, PE of 10, and is posting triple digit revenue growth (and expanding their margins). 

Investor Day 03/18 is a near term catalyst: Management will share JRNY subscription data for the first time (this is a chance for wall street to finally recognize nautilus as the software/hardware company it really is) along with their long-term plan, Northstar. 

I've done a lot of research on this company so please comment if you'd like me to expand on anything. I know only 10% of y'all know how to read so I saved this for last: \~12 minute read on the company and my investment thesis [https://maximiliandamore.ghost.io/nautilus-growth-at-1x-sales/](https://maximiliandamore.ghost.io/nautilus-growth-at-1x-sales/)

The majority of Roblox’s revenue comes from virtual items, but the company has recently rolled out a subscription service.
