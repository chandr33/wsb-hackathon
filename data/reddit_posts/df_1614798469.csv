What if...... What if he decides to exercise his options at his strike price? Let‚Äôs say his strike price is $12.50, that would cost him $625,000. A small chunk of change compared to what he‚Äôs made. 

So now what? The hedgies need to deliver. That‚Äôs 50,000 shares at what the current price is or what ever price they are currently holding on to in their war chest. 

Would this increase the share price exponentially? Keeping in mind all the other calls they need to cover, I think if he does exercise his options, this could easily hit $800. 

Unless my thinking is all wrong. Might need a smarter ape to chime in.

Edit: Everyone keeps fixating on the 50,000 number. I also said keep in mind all the other calls they need to cover. I guess I should‚Äôve clarified that better, my bad.

Okay fellow monkeys- here is the current mortgage play

THE SQUEEZE $RKT

\- As I am sure you are well aware Rocket has been shorted big time by some daft pro‚Äôs who apparently thought they could push the stock down current price and profit. Now the big squeeze arm wrestle is on and if shorters have any sense they would cover exposure faster than Jeff Epsteins killer. Ilhor from SI reports on the interest and as you can tell the crash is inevitable- where it goes nobody knows but what is certain is it would do so harder than a wedding night dick.

If you fancy your chances you might be able to hit a dip and smack these shorts, but if are a school boy fearing to lose your lunch money or you just wanna diversify your book there is a different game in town.  
   
 

$UWMC IS DEEP FUCKING VALUE

Apart from the aforementioned temporary bull signs([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwea4x/uwmc\_dd\_a\_swing\_play\_value\_play\_and\_long\_term/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwea4x/uwmc_dd_a_swing_play_value_play_and_long_term/)) the fundamentals are insane. How you can push your earnings and revenue x8ish and make 3.380 billion net and be trading at single digit P/E levels is shocking- The guidance is bullish, their technology superior to competitors and in the long run this stock can‚Äôt be trading down at these levels- so if you push your liquids this fuckers way you don‚Äôt take the sudden crash and the upside is mad. And short term there is still considerable short interest and funds who are OBLIGED to purchase later this month- remember shorts have to pay the upcoming dividends as well

71,lx1x5s,"I've been trading stocks very passively since Robinhood became available. I would watch a little CNBC, try to identify bargains, then purchase some stock and try to ignore it. Now, I am trading actively every day. I'm a full-time undergraduate math student, and I just got accepted into a graduate program, so it's pretty likely that I will be back to doing passive investing by Fall 2021. FYI I might be studying math finance.

I first heard about WSB through my buddy who started getting into options when we got our stimulus last June. His take was that he was too poor for $1200 to matter very much and that if the economy tanked that wouldn't do him very much good. I think he was pretty actively engaged, made about $5000. I know he's still around here, but he has a regular job so I doubt he's as active as he was back then.

Trading is work. It's kind of like being in business for yourself, a bit like being a professional gambler, and I don't think any of these things means it deserves any stigma. There are psychological labor and decision fatigue and it stays with you after the markets close and on the weekends. I started drinking more and started using a little more THC. None of these things are of major concern: I don't consider my day trading or substance use any kind of addiction.

I joined WSB when GME was popping off. I had been paying attention to the news but didn't buy in till it was about $350 on that Wednesday. Yes WSB influenced my decision, so did the YouTuber In The Money, but I don't think anybody could have predicted the way in which the squeeze was going to be kneecapped that next morning.

I stayed on WSB, trying to figure out the good info from the bad info. I posted to another website about GME. When GME stabilized around $50 I was down $6k, not to mention the fact I had sold my MJ stocks to buy GME (I really should've used cash which I could've deposited).

I didn't really let any of this get to me. We all have our reasons for wanting to make money. IMO it was worth the risk, which is why I'm still here. However, if I want to keep trading, I can't YOLO my money into a meme stock - I'm a student with no income.

So I started getting more serious about options trading. I don't do high probability trading, I just look at charts and buy options based on which direction the price is moving. I've seen videos about the Greeks, but I really don't pay that close attention to things other than the bid-ask spread and IV. I like options because they're leveraged and I can make money on bearish positions.

How does WSB fit into my trading strategy? I look for meme stocks, read the DD, and then look at the chart. If I like the chart I might try a trade, if I don't like it I might ignore it or add it to a watchlist. It's pretty simple and it's helped me identify many profitable trades.

I comment on stuff in the daily thread, sometimes I answer a question. I shit post a little. I call out BS but I don't push my gay af communism on y'all. This is the only Reddit I am on and the only social media I'm on is Mastadon and a few discord channels.

If you've read this, you probably aren't someone constantly screaming in the Daily. If you're new here like me please don't fuck it up. Stop screaming in the daily thread about every little movement of your meme stock. The risk is that we eventually need stricter gatekeeping and that's very intensive and difficult. We might even be targeted by regulators which would make Wall Street very happy.

One final mention is about information security. Infosec is about keeping private info private and public info accurate. I can guarantee you that we have the attention of every major intelligence apparatus (private, public, government, etc) watching what we're doing. There are shills, influencers, bots and bad-actors. This is just a part of any public movement. If you want to read about the way state's organize their counter-intelligence efforts, here's a link to a Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence\_missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence_missions)

Once AMD is able to pick production back up, sales will go through the roof. There is so much demand for their product it is insane.

How's about this, from Reuters, yesterday: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle-idUSKCN2AU2EP

But you have margin turned off! But you have a sell limit set for $69,420.69! IT DOESN'T MATTER. 

INSTANT SETTLEMENTS is what needs to be TURNED OFF. They even hide it away, under profile&gt;menu&gt;investing&gt;DAY TRADE SETTINGS. 

On top of that, THEY DO NOT LET YOU TURN IT OFF IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING DEPOSITS OR HAVE TRADED IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. 

That's the cost of instant settlements. Sure, you get to trade quicker, but you also allow them to trade AGAINST you, and WITH YOUR OWN SHARES.

Can't turn off instant settlements, don't want to be stuck in limbo for a full brokerage transfer, and determined to escape? What can be done?

Well, my fellow smooth-brained ape, I'll tell you what I'm doing:

The following steps assume you are invested primarily in shares of a company, not options. EACH OF THESE STEPS WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

First, open an account at a different brokerage. Make sure it's a cash-account (for some brokerages, like WeBull, etc., YOU MUST OPT-OUT OF SHARE LENDING). With a cash-account, you'll have to sit patiently for settlement of funds from selling shares before you can withdraw those funds or reinvest (but, let's be honest, you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't already patient). I use Fidelity, which is a cash-account by default with several opt-in programs to take advantage of down the line. 

Second, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, transfer/deposit money into your new brokerage from your bank (or wherever else you usually get your money to trade with). If GME is your sole play, and you can afford it, try to deposit around the same amount your GME shares in Robinhood are currently worth. 

Once your deposit is completed (no longer ""pending""), wait for a small dip in the price and buy in with your new broker. 

When the purchase is complete, you can go into Robinhood and sell your shares (ideally, at the same or slightly higher price than you just bought them for at your new brokerage).

Wait out the next few trading days of your Robinhood account and DO NOT TRADE VIA ROBINHOOD. If you trade, you risk resetting the clock on your Withdrawable Cash. You do your trading with your new brokerage from now on. Withdraw your cash from Robinhood ASAP and put it back in your bank account, pay back your wife's boyfriend, or whatever.

Now, if Robinhood wants to keep any short deals they had on your shares, THEY have to hold onto the shares, themselves. Every 1 share you were holding away from shorters (ineffectively), has now become 2 shares (1 effectively, 1 ineffectively). That, or Robinhood actually does sell the shares, which increases the length of the short chain and the costs associated with holding that position.. Thus, shorting attempts are made more expensive and less sustainable. 

Meanwhile, you'll be back to holding your shares without your broker selling them behind your back. 

TLDR: Don't let your diamond hands be sold by the pawn shop that's storing them. Getting out of Robinhood not only helps you, but also hinders the shorts. Two birds with one stone. Power to the players.

Obligatory, not financial advice, not an adviser or professional, do your own research, yadayada. 

If I'm wrong about anything in the above, do not be surprised, but please let me know what it might be. If my foundation is rotted, please kick my case over before anyone even considers moving in. Thanks.",TURN OFF INSTANT SETTLEMENTS and LEAVE ROBINHOOD!,0.95,1614799041,n_ohanlon
