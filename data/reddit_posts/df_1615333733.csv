22,m1jxyj,"Hello fellow Apes and Autists. I rarely post on this forum and only have done so when I have a diamond for you. My other 2 posts were amazing gems. I will try and make this short, simple, sweet for everyone to understand.

GOCO reported earnings yesterday, they made money 133 million or 41 cents per share. 

Fourth quarter 2020 net revenue of $445.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period, and fiscal year 2020 net revenue of $877.4 million increased 63% compared to the prior year period

They are forecasting 1.15 Billion in sales to 1.3 Billiion in sales for 2021 that is 50%

They are expecting earnings of 345 to 385 million that is on 321 million shares.

Let me translate that for you apes! 

**That is at worst $1.07 Per Share Trading at Under $10.50** 

**That is an 8 PE, You will not find any company growing at 50%+ a year with a PE under 8.** 

**Even the boomer dow stocks are over 10PE and grow near 10%**

**What does that mean? Apes get rich and make tendies. GOOD LUCK!**","GoHealth – GOCO The Hidden Gem, In Case you missed AMC or GME, To the MOON!",1.0,1615333940,UltimateTraders

During the storm, Watney is struck by a piece of debris and is carried away by the heavy winds and storms of the virgin planet. Fearing for their lives, the crew continues their evacuation to safety thus leaving their friend, their comrade, for dead. 

Watney, being the resourceful survivalist he is, nurses himself back to health after awaking on the planet to find himself completely alone. His resolve and mental fortitude trumps all else. 

The crew soon finds out that their friend is alive and is faced with the difficult decision of risking their own lives to complete an unlikely rescue mission, or to return home while Watney rots away on a distant planet. They must decide if they want to risk literally everything, or if they want to take their profits of making it out with their own lives. 

Will they leave their comrade to die on an empty and barren planet?

No. 

For those who bought at 250+, we’re coming for you. Exercise your resolve; survive. Martians, we’ve not forgotten about you.

Stop being scared and buy now when its low before FOMO hits and you decide to buy in at +1k.  GME is going to fucking ~~MOON~~ another GALAXY.

This is a once in a life time opportunity. No other stock in history has gone through what GME is going through.  Be a part of history!  Even if its just one share, you're making a difference. 

You've read all the DD from reddit users,  900% stock price increase, the shills from bots, the media coverage, the congress hearing,  Ryan Cohen making big moves with GME, mother fucking DFV DOUBLING his position right after the hearing and etc. HELLLO? Put all the pieces together - ONCE IN A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY.

Whats $200 a share when its going to reach $100k a share. Literally once in a life time opportunity right at your finger tips. Life changing money. 

Lets face it, hedgefunds are fucked.  All you have too do is sit on your fat ass and click buy with your Doritos powdered fingers! Some of you guys just dont seem to get it.
