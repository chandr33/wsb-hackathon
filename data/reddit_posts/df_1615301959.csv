35,m189zy,"**Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) is undervalued, well positioned against competition, and poised to take further market share in rapidly growing and high demand industries.**

AMD is mainly known for its presence in the gaming industry, and some of you may remember it as one of the OG WSB meme stocks. This subreddit has seen the potential of AMD multiple times in the past, and I believe the recent AMD dip has created an excellent opportunity.

**First, let's look at how AMD compares to some of its competition:**

* If you are into PC gaming at all, you will be aware of how CPU sentiment has shifted greatly away from INTC in favor of AMD.

* The main reasons AMD CPUs are becoming more and more preferable are because they offer significantly more bang for your buck versus Intel CPUs, INTC has recently had disappointing new product releases, even high budget PCs are often abandoning Intel entirely.
[CPU Comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html)

* AMD just released new GPUs last week, which are superior in performance and more affordable than many of NVDA's top of the line models. Even though they are still high in price, this shows that AMD is very able and willing to compete with NVDA's top of the line GPUs. They sold out initially within a couple hours of release.
[GPU Comparison](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html)

* AMD produces both the CPUs and GPUs in both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X. These consoles only just released a few months ago and will be in extremely high demand for the next 5 years or more.
[How AMD gained hold of the console market](https://itigic.com/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-why-use-amd-cpu-gpu/)

NVDA Market Cap: $290B
INTC Market Cap: $245B
**AMD Market Cap: $89.5B**

Morningstar's research indicates that AMD's fundamental value is around $80 price per share. Meanwhile, they estimate NVDA's fundamental value to be around $330. These estimates tend to be conservative, yet even after this correction that tech has endured, most remain well above their fundamental value - except AMD.

**As I am typing this, AMD is currently under $75 price per share. Even if AMD somehow had extremely minimal future growth (I will further outline why future growth will actually be astronomical), it would still fundamentally be valued at $80 per share AT LEAST, and that's with boomer estimates.**

I don't claim that NVDA or INTC are bad companies, rather I seek to point out that AMD is being underestimated by Wall Street. There's more than enough room for all of these companies to have a future in the gaming industry and adjacent industries.

[The gaming industry experienced record growth in 2020, and isn't stopping any time soon.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990)

I see some claims that the end of lockdowns will mean less people playing video games or using computers, I don't think this claim is even worth seriously addressing. If you seriously think that you may be a little out of touch.

**Other Industries AMD Will Succeed In**

While my primary focus has been on AMD's success in the gaming industry, their GPU's are also widely used for mining the digital currencies that cannot be named or discussed on this subreddit, but it is still worth mentioning that market and the large demand that it brings. We've also seen NVDA branch off into the autonomous driving and AI industries, AMD could easily do the same.

[AMD CEO, Lisa Su, has previously expressed interest in branching towards EV and AI industries, and says AMD's technology is already there. (This is the best link I can find at the moment)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/b4w1hm/is_amd_getting_more_serious_about_autonomous/)

**Semiconductor Shortage?**

Some people cite the recent semiconductor shortage as a reason to be bearish on AMD and related companies. While this is an issue, it is clearly short term, and I think these shortages have been more than priced in by now, especially for AMD. [Demand is extremely high, which is good, and AMD is working on increasing their capacity.](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/lisa-su-shortages-constrained-amd-s-record-2020-and-will-continue) Lisa Su says she expects shortages to ease the second half of 2021, adding that they will have added capacity in the second half of 2021.

The demand for AMD products is extremely high, this is clearly bullish in the long term. AMD‚Äôs technology will continue to be very valuable in many industries, the potential for growth here is still astronomical. Lisa Su is a great CEO who has brought AMD in a great and very competitive direction, and there are few CEOs better suited to successfully navigate any future speedbumps.

If that still doesn‚Äôt sooth your mind, [the Biden Administration has already committed to easing the shortage.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html)

**Positions?**

I tried to keep this analysis relatively short and sweet. I believe I have made a compelling case to be bullish on AMD in the coming months/year. IV on $AMD calls at the moment is extremely low, historically low. As low as 45% on many, making this a great time to buy, shares are also a fantastic choice. I recommend you give yourself enough time in case AMD continues to dip along with the rest of tech, but YOLO to your heart‚Äôs content if you wish to do so.

$AMD $100c 7/16, $AMD $120c 01/21/22

**TL;DR: AMD is undervalue, buy calls or shares**

I dream of a day the front page of r/wallstreetbets is once again flooded with the face and worship of Lisa Su.","It is time to return to tradition. Re-introducing the OG meme stock, $AMD.

So at 1am I called their support line and waited on hold for about 20 minutes and spoke to a very nice lady.

Good Morning,

The music to this post is **Diamond** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.

I own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..

**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.

I will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.

Before we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?

Poser.

**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**

**Good news -**

u/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.

[https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png](https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png)  \- Ortex Stats

**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\*cough Cough\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\*cough cough\***

**Short Utilization** \- 100

**On Loan -** 7.29M

**Short Interest** \- 8.9 M

**Cost to borrow** \- 7.5

**Average age on loan** \- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28

What we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But that's the hopium read.

Or they are could just be reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list... Premarket looks great just sayin....

**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...

**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**

Again, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...

# Why Canoo?

**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**

I spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.

Please see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.

/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted ""According to a recent [Mckinsey study, ""The New Realities of Premium Mobility,""](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""

But what about EV's in General.

Another [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.

1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.
2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.
3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \*
4. Affordability is coming.\*
5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \*
6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \*
7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*

We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.

Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.

Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  ""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""

He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.

Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?

Why am I breathing hard?

I just got done moving some goalposts.

What might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.

This shit is wild.

So I initiated the transfer and being the smooth brain ape that I am, I did not realize it would take 5-8 business days. Fuck! This isn't good. So at 1am I called their support line and waited on hold for about 20 minutes and spoke to a very nice lady. She told me that the transfer team comes in Monday and since I called early enough, they could most likely stop it. Great! No worries! Monday rolls around and I get a response from support to confirm that it was indeed early enough to cancel and I should be ok. Last night, after an awesome day of GME gainz, I get an email from RH that said they received the ACATS transfer request and my account is now deactivated and it will take 5-8 business days. FUCK!
