1. Introduction

Wikisoft’s flagship online platform, Wikiprofile.com, aims to be a powerful solution with tools and resources for businesses and business professionals to find valid information quickly and easily so that they can make informed career and hiring decisions.

By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, Wikisoft seeks to process raw data elements and refine them into tangible and valuable insights for businesses and business professionals.

They believe, In line with increasing globalization, that there is a growing demand for access to credible company and employee information worldwide.

The company´s vision and strategy:

*“Our vision is to create opportunity globally for business professionals and businesses to make informed career and hiring decisions.*

*Manifesting this vision requires scaling information technology with high data validity across the key pillars: business professionals, businesses, job opportunities and professional skills.*

*By pursuing this vision, we believe Wikisoft can enable users to connect to business opportunities on a global scale.”* *(Source:* [*https://www.wikisoft.com/*](https://www.wikisoft.com/)*)*

The company was founded by Rasmus Refer in 2017 and was launched under Wikiprofile.com in 2018. Mr. Refer established to company with a clear goal in mind, he wanted to create the opportunity for businesses and professionals to make informed career and hiring decisions.

In 2019 a restructuring took place and with it the listing on the OTC stock market was decided in the same year. The next steps followed quickly with listing on the stock market audited financials are required. A year later in 2020, the new CEO, Mr. Carsten Kjems Falk was appointed. Mr Falk is a great leader and was the Chief Marketing Officer of Clearsense Sweden, a scalable data platform for healthcare from 2010 to 2013 and the CEO of Domino´s Pizza DK from 2013 to 2019. In the meantime, he held various advisory board positions.

In the same year, the new chairman, Mr. Paul C Quintal joined the company. Mr. Quintal also brings valuable experience and knowledge to the company, he is still the Chief Customer Officer at Pentius Inc. to this date. Pentius is a serial developer of web-based properties.

But the real breakthrough for this company happened just recently. The company launched their new investor website [http://www.wikisoft.com](http://www.wikisoft.com/) and also their new flagship platform and main revenue driver [www.wikiprofile.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/www.wikiprofile.com).

To better visualize the milestones, a graphic from the investor presentation March 2021 is attached:

2. Analysis

Wikisoft has undergone massive change since its inception. The founder quickly realized in order to be a globally successful company, he has to be recognized globally. Therefore, the plan to restructure the company and list it on the stock exchange was a bold but hopefully rewarding step. The company has therefore successfully overcome 2 “restructuring phases” and is now at the most crucial phase as shown on the graph below:

  

https://preview.redd.it/yc1yfhx3xyp61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00f2c801671f9900f5c80d3f7b0c1eefb9ace803

Wikisoft provides attractive investment opportunities:

· As with a lot of tech companies, Wikisoft also has limited operational costs and is therefore on the best and easiest way to profitability. 

· What makes tech companies also attractive is the fact, that their revenue streams are highly scalable.

· Coupled with the fact that they have limited operational costs make these companies extremely profitable cash flow machines.

· Strong brand recognition &amp; credibility help in reducing marketing costs

· Another big factor is also the global access. With their big databases they can gather information on all companies worldwide and provided the needed information for every person.

Wikisoft operates in the Global staffing industry. This industry offers a big and growing total addressable market (TAM) with relatively low competitors:

 

[https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/624116\/staffing-industry-revenue-worldwide\/](https://preview.redd.it/dtag8wa6xyp61.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e18b78cd9a7cc7641775c978a06ab739cb4de9)

The Global staffing industry revenues has grown with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 6% per year! Which makes it big enough to take market share and really attractive with its revenue growth rate.

Let´s compare Wikisoft, which is a relatively new company, with its peers and what they have accomplished:

Hired raised **132$ million** since founding in 2012. More than 10,000 of the top companies using Hired and can save significant time screening their candidates. In fact it is claimed that it **reduces the time to hire by 33%!**

Glassdoor, founded in 2008 was acquired by Recruit Holdings for **1.2$ billion** in May 2018. Provides recruiting solutions to over 7,000 employers – including 40% of the Fortune 500 companies. 

Last but not least, LinkedIn (established in 2005) was acquired by Microsoft for a staggering **26.2$ billion**. It is estimated that their channel sales consist of 3.4$ billion Talent solutions, 1$ billion Marketing solutions and 1.3$ billion subscriptions. 

(source: [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/))

This showcases the potential for such a young company like Wikisoft, which is certainly a good buy-out candidates for other big players in this field, what is possible in this sector. The subscription model that LinkedIn has, is a prime example what recurring revenues offer, if one of the biggest tech companies, Microsoft, is interested in acquiring you.

3. Outlook

With companies in their growth phase, it is important to gather a lot of cash. This can be best done with dilution of shares. Wikisoft has filed a listing on the OTC stock exchange exactly for this reason. In order to invest more in their growing company and reaching their goals they need a lot of cash. The company also published a roadmap of their goals for the current year 2021:",Analysis Report Wikisoft Corp. Ticker: (WSFT),1.0,1617024099,stanley9528

41,mfpt8i,"I posted this message in another thread and was asked begin a new thread on the subject.  I have been successfully using this strategy for three years. 

**Objective**

* Establish a % annual return objective.  The market averages 8%, you may want to select 12% for example.  The higher the % the greater the risk of failure, however.
*  Allocate a specific portion of your liquid assets for this strategy
*  Plan to hold 5 or more stocks each with an equal % of portfolio value
* Manage the performance of this strategy in a journal separate from the rest of your investments.
* Compile a candidate watchlist of 50 to 100 tickers from dividend champions, contenders that pay over 3% dividend, have increased dividends every year for 10 years. Adding low beta to your screen results in smaller pullbacks during market downturns.   I added some MLP’s to this list.

**Action plan**

* Screen the watch list for the best candidates.   My screen requires the ticker to be uptrending on the 12-month chart and in a pullback to support on the 50% Linear Regression Channel.
* Check the list of screened candidates for the best opportunities. I would not enter all at one time, but gradually fill your portolio over a few months.
* Write short puts against the selected tickers 60 days out, which provides the annualized return in that meets your objective. This generally will provide 10 to 15% downside protection. ALWAYS, take more safety over more return as long as your annualized return objective is met.
* Immediately write a GTC exit at 55% of max profit, which I have found delivers a much greater annualized return than waiting to expiration.  So if the annualized return at expiration is 15%, a managed early exit at 55% of max profit will deliver about 20% annualized on average.
* Write a new put when the GTC buyback occurs
* If put, your dividend goes up by the % of your downside protection.
* If put, begin writing covered calls. The strike selection should provide a net annualized return of 12% using my number –--- 12% = dividend + premium on calls. Once filled immediately write a GTC buy back at 55% of max return. You do not want to be called out at a loss, so your premium should not exceed what is required for your annualized return objective
* Use a more aggressive call strike selection if you want to get out of the stock – ie, the company is totally failing, or the ticker has moved up to a level you can exit at a profit and begin selling puts on a new ticker.

This strategy may not beat the market during major bull runs, but will be the market in mildly up years, flat years, down years, and over the long haul.  The concept is to continue the cash flow (or growth) during market down years that could be extended.  So during these down periods, your portfolio value may fall below earlier highs, but your market-beating growth/income is maintained even through an extended market pullback via dividends and premiums from covered calls.",A Conservative Strategy to Beat the Market with Options and Divies,1.0,1617025263,Graydrake1

1. If you called Fidelity previously to request a trade/shares move from margin to cash, it may revert itself due to an internal process option on their end - Note: this is per-rep.  Some reps may do this correctly and some may not.  I've had to call 3 times to get this corrected.  In the previous 2 calls to request to move from margin to cash on a specific holding, the change was reflected correctly live while on the phone with Fidelity rep.  While on phone, I refreshed screen, and the position showed correctly changed as cash only.  But the next business day (and subsequent following business days) the position reverted back to being tagged as margin and.
2. If you have shares tagged as margin but you DO NOT have a margin debit on the account, Fidelity will not loan out those shares.

So if you were trading late Friday as I was, you noticed the crazy EOD upward action in the SPY **AND RKT** (pictured above)

We found out over the weekend that a major HF blew up on Friday. Archegoes had 15 Billion in capital that they used for 80 Billion in longs and **40 BILLION IN SHORT TRADES.** 

Right now the long side of the book is making all news **BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT 40 BILLION SHORT BOOK????**

Notice how EOD Friday the SPY **AND RKT** shot straight up together? We know Archegoes was short the SPY and judging by the price action in RKT I would say they were also going short RKT (ie: long rates and short mortgage brokers)

**HOWEVER**

RKT is more of a fintech than a traditional mortgage broker **AND RKT PRINTS MONEY  \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\]**

Here are some fun RKT stats:

***RKT made 15 bill last year and 9 of that was NET income***

108 million share float

112 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders

BILLION $$$ Buy Back

Guided Q1 UUUPPPP 90%-99% YoY (I heard they are running +150% and **Q1 will BLOW OUT TO THE UPSIDE**)

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.
