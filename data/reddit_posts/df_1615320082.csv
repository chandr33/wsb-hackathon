38,m1f1zi,"Seen a lot of people asking about Roblox IPO, wanting to share what I’ve learned over the last week, as I like the stock. 

1: A lot of comments about where to buy IPO. To answer this, wait until market close today, and look for publications/press release from the company itself, as they are making this IPO available in the form 199 million stock tomorrow morning. 

2: Second thing I’ve seen is quite a few people asking about buy in, and to set the record straight as far as I’ve seen, the share price is somewhere between 35-120. Making me think that they are not sure what they are going to list at quite yet. 

3: This stock is going to be retail driven. There are some publications stating that this may go poorly, but the most accurate article (in this apes opinion) is that this stock may actually be a solid investment for those looking to invest.

I have literally never made a real post here, and I am NOT giving financial advice. I just like the stock. Also first DD, hope I did this right.

**I know that I can't be the only one that has learned from GME.** I have been investing for roughly one year now (18 y/o), and have been drilled for making risky decisions by my family in the past. ""It's dangerous,"" or ""you will lose all your money,"" constantly telling me to conform to the ""old way"" of earning money, putting money in a reliable ETF or Bond and waiting for it to mature in 10 years making 7% in the process. **But thanks not only to GME, but to you apes, I have been able to make more money (and lose more as well- lol) from the INSANE DD AND DISCUSSION on here.** I have now spent hours learning and trying to improve my financial literacy because of you guys. **Us apes might have just began a new wave in the global market. I am not only honored to be a member but to call you my community.**
