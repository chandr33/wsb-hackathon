The company is in a position to print their own money in the form of NFTs (Non-fungible Token).


While NFT’s have gotten a lot of coverage recently and seem like just hype, they are here to stay.


Think about the implications of a video game being able to tokenize and sell any item in any game and those items be able to be traded between players.


HERE’S THE BIG PART:
When minting NFTs, the creator can add a small fee to the token that pays a small royalty to the creator EVERY TIME IT CHANGES HANDS.
