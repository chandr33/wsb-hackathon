1. Same logic as the shorts thinking it'd crash today and tomorrow thus doubling down. Why buy for divvy on Friday and make shorts cover then and avoid paying the divvy? Better to set a bear trap because shorts would still be on the hook for divvy and scared shorts would cover, thus making SP increase more and you'd make more on the share appreciation than divvy. Why settle for a 1.11 divvy when you can squeeze more out of a short? Classic bear trap.

# The Chekov Shotgun

[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/?sort=new) we explored this stock to a small degree.  The exploration was personal and I appreciate you listening.  One person pointed out my ellipses were excessive. Thank you for that.   Another person told me I as retarded.  Thank you for that.  Many people were encouraged by my lack of financial literacy and tin foil hat philosophy. This is concerning.  I can, however, only assure you that when the MathChads (u/pennyether, u/manponzi)  and Cartesian Ghost Aka Godfather Aka Hall9000 Aka /u/jn_ku showed up and told me that I wasn't entirely stupid.

**I figured I was on to something.**

My argument is this -

**1 -** GOEV is oversold.  It is still well below the 20day MVA.  Macromarket forces have been pushing this down more than it deserves.  There is probably some sort of effort to get out from underneath a falling piano of EV hype + SPAC disgust.  I believe that Canoo is farther along than many other plays.  CanooBros will chime in and tell you all about it.

**2** \- There is a solid amount of Short Interest.  Ortex tells us that the short interest increased to 9.2 M shares up from 8.5 Million shares. Data suggests the shorts are in from 17-20.  This is the zone we need to be in..Utilization is at 100 which means that shorts are either recycling shares, ortex doesn't know where the shares are obtained from, or MM are utilizing naked exceptions to provide shares. ^(Or there is naked shorting. Shhhhh)

**3** \- There is an upcoming catalyst of a Motor Press Guild (AKA real shit) is hosting a digital conference with big names like VW, JEEP, Honda, Acura, Fisker, Karma and Canoo.  Fisker and Karma are lining up for the luxury sedan crossover SUV and won't be competing with Canoo.  Canoo seeks to disrupt the market by designing a skateboard where different vehicles will be built on top of.  Again CanooBros tell us all about it below.  They have now detailed what the reveal is and it is ""*Canoo Pick-up Truck world premiere presented by Tony Aquila, Executive Chairman, Canoo with Bryan Biniak, Founder &amp; CEO, Connected Travel*"".  Whatever it is, we need something that revalues the company.  IMHO if they discuss manufacturing and delivery date. You might be able to move out of the basement. We'll see.

# Pulling Its Trigger

# The Data in the table below was aggregated by /u/pennyether and was first brought to my attention by /u/manponzi.

The way you should read this is what's known as delta hedging.  Simply put when market makers sell an options contract they must purchase a certain number of shares to remain delta neutral.  This is figured out by magic math.  But as the price moves towards the strike price and the date market makers must purchase more and more shares.  

|**Price Point**|**#Shares Delta Hedged**|**Float %**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**11**|**1,757,118**|**12.12%**|
|**12**|**2,867,471**|**17.07%**|
|**13**|**4,042,046**|**27.88%**|
|**14**|**5,241,603**|**44.35%**|
|**15**|**6,430,636**|**44.35%**|
|**16**|**7,581,094**|**52.29%**|
|**17**|**8,673,417**|**59.82%**|

What's important here is that there is relatively low free float and a decent amount of shorting going on and based on Ortex Data the shorts are out of cheap ammo.  

This is tactical warfare.  Bigger forces are already at work setting this up.  Some whales are giving shorts enough rope to hang themselves with.  With the EV truck announcement.  All it takes is one quick shove in the right direction...  

According to /u/Manponzi 13617 Calls were placed vs 1063 Puts today... that's 10x Call VS Puts.. Giddyup.

**So what BrotherLuminous?**  

Well, you can hitch your cart to this rocket ship and see how it goes.  Or it can get clubbed like a baby seal during canadian thanksgiving..  

This is **wallstreetbets**. Not **Wallstreet-40yrbondyield-and-life-insurance-equity-stay-inside-wear-a-helmet-at-all-times**.

40,m0nm3u," Alright fellow simians, I am hoping we are evolving enough to where we can begin talking specifics in terms of the options market on our beloved AMC. I know many are hesitant, fearing that if specific prices aren't reached by Friday, younger apes in the pack may grow scared and begin to doubt our journey. I am hoping by now we have done enough research on the market itself to now understand specific pricing goals and not be discouraged by them if the week doesn't go as planned.

TLDR: If you are like me and data makes your snake hiss, or your cat growl for my ape sisters, stick around. If you're going to pout and take your ball home if we happen to miss a target price come friday, GTFOH...Sorry for yelling, I still love you, (bro hug).

Alright so as a nerd at heart a good spread sheet to me can beat a free premium pornhub account especially when it's a spreadsheet about boosting our AMC and speeding up the count down to our moon launch.

As you should all know, the options market and corresponding weekly Gamma squeezes will help push our rocket towards the launch pad much quicker than just the buy and hold campaign. Now, options are a different breed and can burn young gun apes bad so I am not suggesting playing ""just the tip"" with them if you do not fully understand the risk. Think playing said game with a cigar cutter...

Anyways, options have huge impact on stock price as each contract is for 100 shares. So the more contracts that are sold by market makers, the more 100x shares they must purchase the following monday at market price if the contracts are exercised. This is the foundation of Gamma. If you're not tracking and want to learn more, please reach out. Seriously, I'm not a weirdo, I'm not offering you free candy out of a sketchy van, I just know that the smarter our pack gets and learns the game, the worse it is for the Hedge Fucks. I am not an advisor, so I will not and do not give advice, but I will give information and hypotheticals for my ape brothers and sisters to make their own decisions.

In an earlier post this weekend I commented on how absurd (good thing) the options game is right now on AMC. AMC is now has the 11th most active options contracts. Yes, AMC, movie theaters. If you don't get why that is unfucking believable you must have been fortunate enough to be in a coma during the wet fart on first date of a year that was 2020 thanks to the rona.

Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Now at a strike of 8, if market prices is at or above 8.79 the number of options ITM is 27,688 or 2,768,800 shares at stake... how would you feel about that if you were shorted on AMC? Personally, I'd be curled up under my desk crysterbating while sucking my other thumb...

Below is a table I made listing the price at which options are ATM and the number of contracts that would be ATM or ITM at strikes below these are for all contracts sold expiring Friday (3/12):

7.98: 43 options ATM 4300 shares

8.03: 615 options ATM 65,800 shares

8.04: 3604 options ATM 360,400 shares

8.05: 5735 options ATM 573,500 shares

8.14: 8,054 options ATM 805,400 shares

8.38: 12,358 options ATM 1,235,800 shares

8.79: 27,688 options ATM 2,678,800 shares

Now sharing this info is meant to help shareholders know the power of the options game and keeping the weekly monday Gamma cycle going. I haven't done the research for this past friday. But the 8.01 buzzer beater that left me needing to change my jocks two weeks ago gave us a 14.5% jump that following monday.

""But why then are we still hovering around 8?!?! I want more and I want it now! Wahhh!""

Well that's because the HFs still had ladder attack power to push things back down by week's end. You beloved apes buying more stonk and holding it is taking that power away slowly. The less shares they have for ladder attack bullshit the more/longer that monday gamma price spike will hold.

As you can see above, things are good at almost any price above 8. But the 8 dollar call had a 10,000+ increase in the number of contracts sold at that strike last week compared to the week prior, hence the more than double resulting power compared to 8.38 (which is an 8 call sold a while back at a premium of .38 a share)

So for me personally, and not advising anyone to bandwagon, I'm going to be cheering for 8.80 at Friday's close so those 27,688 contracts containing 2,768,800 shares are ITM.

But even if it doesn't quite make it, I'll still have a smile ear to ear as I know the options ITM below are still pretty damn powerful in the fight against douche bags like Gabriel Plotkin and the rest of the Hedge Fucks...",Options Game on AMC is on FIRE right now!,1.0,1615231298,Abuck71588

63,m0nou8,"I wish I was on WSB earlier to tell all my fellow clowns about this goldmine. But it‚Äôs still not even close to too late. Madison Square Garden has been treated more unfairly through covid than any other stock on the market (besides the suits having &lt;100% short floats in others.. $GMEüöÄ). 

Why I like the stock:

- Right before covid, it was floating in the $300 range. It bottomed out at $140, now at $200

- NY just allowed them to start having fans at games. I assume this was the catalyst for its recent gains. Right now they only allow 2,000 fans. 10% of the 200,000 capacity. I predict as they‚Äôre allowed to have more and more people, we will get more and more tendies 

- Pent up demand for sports tickets and concerts once they return will drive up ticket prices. I believe they‚Äôll be selling out many events for a while after covid.

Side Notes: 

-$MSGS is NOT a rocket ship. Think of it more like an escalator. I doubt there will be a short squeeze of any kind but it will show consistent, dare I say guaranteed, returns. 

- Very important you know this is $MSGS. There are two other MSG stocks representing their tv network and casino/restaurant portfolios. I‚Äôm talking about the physical sports arena/concert venue Madison Square Garden.

My positions:

- 12/17/21 $200 call, been holding since December and seen 55% returns 

- 4/16/21 $210 call, purchased today because I like the god damn stock that much and will probably buy another December call with the gains from this one when it‚Äôs time

Conclusion:

- I see this as a bet against Covid. Once covid is gone and we‚Äôre 100% back to normal, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason this stock shouldn‚Äôt be worth at least $300 again. Unlike some other stocks which could possibly not return to their previous value because of a change in consumer behavior, the people who want to see the rangers win a Stanley Cup or the Knicks get their ass kicked or Billy Joel play the piano for the 100th time will not be scared to buy tickets at the Garden, especially because they haven‚Äôt been able to for so long.

As you may or may not be aware, CD Projekt not only owns beloved game development studio CD Projekt Red, but also Good Old Games.  This would cement Game Stop in both the game production side of house (allowing them to sell exclusives in store or on GOG.com) and allow them to have a ready made digital distribution platform that could compete with the likes of Steam and Epic Gamestore (among others).  

With CD Projekt's latest stumble with its Cyberpunk 2077 release I feel there is no better time to strike and finally bring GME into the full digital age.

I like to do some research so I don‚Äôt go into withdrawal while the markets are closed‚Ä¶ I really hate that you can only lose money 5 days a week, but I digress. 

I‚Äôve read some fantastic DD about the anomaly of gamma squeezes in the last few weeks, obviously with $GME being the primary example, but $RKT was another (much shorter term) great lesson in how the put-to-call ratio combined with a strong catalyst can create massive run up in a stock. I have learned that there seems to be a pretty consistent formula to the moon. Many of you already know this, but I‚Äôll reiterate the math: 

(a good company) + (high short interest) + (bullish options chain) + (catalyst) = üöÄ

I like to think of the company as the wood, short interest and put-to-call ratio as the jet fuel, and a catalyst (new information or events) as the match. We‚Äôll come back to this.


Part One: Going Long

GOGO is an in-flight internet service provider. I want to start by saying that I love this stock long term for a ton of reasons. From a sentiment perspective, I am massively bullish on travel now that things are looking up on the vaccine front, and I have increased my positions in reopening stocks accordingly. 

Financials

* Recent sale of the cash sucking &amp; competitive commercial side of the business was much needed and debt will come down significantly
* Remaining private aviation business is basically a monopoly, and has customers that are quite insensitive to price increases. Private flights will soar post-pandemic, and we are in an era where connectivity is essential
* Operating income of $22M in Q3, at a time when nobody was flying, is insanely good. That‚Äôs $90M operating income annualized in the middle of a pandemic with basically zero travel
* Let‚Äôs conservatively call it $200M (Ann.) of operating income once things return to normal and $80M (Ann.) of interest expense... maybe $40M capex... that‚Äôs $80M cash flow for a $1B company, a 12 multiple.
* Trading at 12x cash flow in a growing industry is one of the cheapest prices for a growth company you can find anywhere

With NO OTHER INFLUENCE, based on valuation and performance alone, my price target for this stock is $16. But there‚Äôs more to the story‚Ä¶ and they report earnings THIS THURSDAY


Part Two: Squeezus take the wheel

There are two components that make a good rocket fuel, and this time we‚Äôve been treated to the 420.69 octane, high quality, primo NASA fuckin moon mix. 

Short Interest: 

- 40.05% of float (as of Feb. 11)
- -8% since last reported (means shorts are starting to close positions)

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GOGO

Options Chain:

Now FEAST YOUR EYES on what‚Äôs got me harder than my wife‚Äôs boyfriend on his birthday. The call to put ratio is BANANAS. 66:1!?!?!? AM I DREAMING???? There are 43,143 calls vs. 696 puts expiring in the near term. BULLISH. AS. FUCK. https://i.imgur.com/b3xeeYE.png

$RKT was 10:1 calls to puts before it blasted off. Just sayin.


Part Three: The Big Bang

So we‚Äôve got a solid company with good prospects for the future, high (but decreasing) short interest, and an insanely bullish options chain. We just need that spark baby, and there are a few:

* Rumblings that there‚Äôs a large player gobbling up shares left right and centre for the last 3-4 months. The company has delayed announcement of a refi plan that has been in the works for some time. I believe there could be a large announcement at earnings call Thursday. POTENTIALLY EVEN AN ACQUISITION. 
* Also a high expectation of beating earnings, based on Zack‚Äôs research of analyst ratings. Basically saying that several indicators show that some analysts might know something, and have taken a more bullish stance on GOGO before earnings. This alone should drive up the share price if they beat expectations https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gogo-gogo-expected-beat-earnings-173005394.html


TL;DRIf this thing pops off like I expect it to, OTM call options will be triggered, forcing sellers to buy shares and cover these positions. This triggers MORE OTM calls, driving the price up even more, rinse &amp; repeat. It ALSO happens to put pressure on the heavy short positions right before Q1 closes out. 

I might have a smooth brain, but when I see an overwhelmingly bullish outlook, I BUY ALL FUCKING DAY. Somebody knows something here and I plan to be in the middle of it. Would love to see some more DD from others on this. To the moon retards üöÄüåô
