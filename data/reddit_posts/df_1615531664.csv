38,m3c85r,"Please quit saying $1,000,000+/share for GME and we can set the price because the hedgies have to buy at any price. The infinite squeeze is a myth.

The GME short squeeze was killed in its infancy when RH cut off trading. It sucks because GME may have indeed reached $1K+ without RH interfering. Most, if not all of those initial shorts have covered since then. What’s happening in GME now is a gamma squeeze. 

A gamma squeeze in GME can still make a lot of share holders wealthy as long as enough call options end ITM each week and option sellers are continually forced to purchase shares to cover.

But this concept that we have the shorts by the short and curlies because there aren’t enough shares to cover just isn’t true.

Let’s break it down to basic math in a simple example. 

For our example, let’s say GME only has 2 shares of float (public shares).

Hedgies got greedy and sold 3 naked shorts (when only 2 shares actually exist).

Diamond Hand Ape buys 1 of the 2 existing shares and holds it until the end of time.

Now there is only 1 share of float and still 3 naked shorts who have to cover.

We got ‘em! Right?

Not so fast.

Hedgie A who sold a naked short buys the one remaining share to cover his position. That share effectively transfers to Paper Hand Ape A who bought the borrowed share from Hedgie A originally.

So Hedgie A has covered his short position, taken his loss and he’s out. Cussing those WSB assholes that screwed up his perfectly calculated short play.

The price of GME goes up $20 and Paper Hand Ape A who bought the share from Hedgie A decides to cash in and sell.

It’s good timing because Hedgie B is tired of getting his ass kicked on his short position and needs to close out. He buys the share from Paper Hand Ape A and now he’s covered his short position and he’s out.

The share Hedgie B just bought effectively transfers to Paper Hand Ape B who bought the borrowed share from Hedgie B originally.

Low and behold, GME goes up another $50. Paper Hand Ape B needs to buy a new PS5 to keep busy while his wife is entertaining her boyfriend so he decides to take his profit and sell.

Hedgie C is about to get margin called on his horrific short bet and jumps at the chance to buy the share Paper Hand Ape B just decided to sell.

The deal is done and Hedgie C licks his wounds and covers his position.

If you followed what just happened, all three greedy Hedgies who sold those naked shorts just covered their positions with ONLY 1 SHARE. 

They didn’t need Diamond Hand Ape’s 1 share. He can hold that forever and it doesn’t prevent them from covering.

Listen, I’ve enjoyed the ride and made money on GME. This gamma squeeze is somewhat unprecedented and may be a major play in the markets going forward.

But the simple math is, you can diamond hand your share as long as you want but as long as others are selling (liquidity), shorts can cover.

Play the gamma squeeze if you want. I have been. But don’t fool yourself on the infinite squeeze.

Tyson foods is something y’all should maybe be looking at. As a non-financial dude, here is a quick due diligence.

1. Tyson is one of the biggest, if not biggest meat manufacturers ever.

2. All of my school districts around me only use Tyson chicken for their supply

3. Tyson follows a very simple pattern and we are in the midst of it repeating again. 

4. Chicken chicken, winner dinner.. idkkk the saying but let’s get some gains &amp; bring some different opinions and stocks on this subreddit again!!
