27,m0yr2s,"Hey Retards,

This post isn’t about a specific stock I am pushing or a meme. This post is about why we do what we do.

Being a person on this subreddit and interested in the stock market, I have learned a lot about how it all works. As a result, my family often talks to me about stocks and getting advice for retirement and other financial goals. If you are on this subreddit, you probably know more about the stock market than most people. You probably know mutual funds, expense ratios, and all that boomer shit. 

My dad was curious about what I thought of his retirement plan. His broker is Edward Jones and they do some kind of shitty actively managed thing. This broker has been 'friends' with my dad for years and trusted him to invest and trade in his best interest - my dad doesn't know stocks very well. My dad gets charged about $160 per month (!) for this non-fiduciary broker to 'actively manage' his retirement account however he wants. Unsurprisingly, my dad’s account has been underperforming the market in the single digits YOY. For some reason, this bozo broker has my father’s retirement in about 20 mutual funds (Franklin, Templeton, and Columbia) which have very high (&gt;1%) expense ratios. They have also been absolutely tanking compared to literally every stock out there (Even the oil heavy “Natural Resources” fund has unrealized losses - WTF!!). In another account, this fucker bought one share of $WLLAW at $241.65. It is now worth $3. Looking at the chart, I have no idea how this retard did this. The real retards are the ones who don’t post their retarded trades on this sub…

Thinking about this, I am just pissed that these guys get paid to trade regular people’s money like this and jeopardize my dad’s retirement. I come from a poorer/working class family, my dad divorced from my crazy mom and she abused the divorce/custodial system to drain my dad dry (She just got back from her vacation from Mexico even though she has been jobless since the pandemic). Once he saved enough money, he literally built the house he plans to retire in. I did much of the lighting and electrical work while in high school. While working on a car elevator in the garage (big car guy) he fell and became paralyzed from the midsection down. He is now in a wheelchair and is deprived of his favorite hobbies for the rest of his life. Now, his retirement is dangerously low to be able to retire comfortably. This forces him to either work more or take riskier strategies to make enough to retire. Realizing that this guy has been screwing my dad over from his retirement that he built with his own hands makes me pretty pissed off at these fuckers. We are going to be calling him pretty soon and asking how he can possibly be making such retarded trades before transferring brokerages. Fuck these fuckers.

TL;DR: Fuck wall street and these scummy fucks who work for them.

31,m0yrm8,"I spend about 100 hours a week checking stocks every day and was wondering why DISCA is sky rocketing like crazy while the S&amp;P 500 has been somewhat flat. Seems like this is may be from momentum traders entering, but I'm not really sure why. I do know that when momentum flips on a news catalyst, these kind of stocks can drop fast and hard.

Lo and behold, the DISCA CEO just offloaded a HUGE $30 MM position last friday (March 4th):

I made a pretty penny shorting MRNA after the CEO sold an unusually large amount last year. It took about two days for the market to gain awareness of the sale (the SEC public disclosure forms take a lot of time to sort through and evaluate), then the stock dropped like a rock.

52,m0yvy6,"We all know this movement is about more than just tendies. So I'd like to hear about some of your fondest movie theater memories in honor of the AMC squeeziness. Here are two of mine:

1. My first time ever in the theater was for Men in Black. I grew up in a tiny town in nowhere Kansas, with a single screen theater. I was 8 years old. My mom allowed me to go with my older brother and his friends. It blew my freakin mind. My love of the movie experience was solidified the moment that alien crook blinked sideways and jumped off that building. My mom said I was so excited I came home and told her everything about the movie down to the smallest detail. What a great movie.

2. Say what you will about the Star Wars prequel trilogy, but when I got to see The Phantom Menace in the theater as a kid it was incredible. The lightsaber battles, the way your seat rattled from the noise as podracers screamed past the screen. We went to a larger theater out of town to see that one, and that's when I knew for sure that size matters! Forget seeing new movies at home. I'd trade a thousand movies at home for a chance to have an experience like that again (looking at you to do me right Top Gun 2!)
