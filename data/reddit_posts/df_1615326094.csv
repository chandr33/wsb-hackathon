**TL;DR PT for Friday 3/12/2021 $388**

I'm refraining from mentioning the ticker name on purpose

Here our my thoughts on a PT of $388 for Friday 3/12/2021

By drawing a line in sand for multiple points in time I can calculate the change in price related to volume.

The two most notetable points in time for me was the [trading halt](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/why-are-brokers-halting-gamestop-trading/) on 1/28/21 and when [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/) on 2/19/2021. The time between these two events was exactly 21 days. Thus using 21 days I back tracked to 1/6/2021 for a basis of price and volume change up to the trading halt. I then used 21 days to estimate where I will be 21 days from DFV's double down ; we are currently on day 18 and day 21 will be Friday 3/12/2021.

First I calculated price change by looking at the open and close price for each event

Price change = Close Price - Open price

This tells me how much price action took place over a given event

&amp;#x200B;

|Event|Start|End|Days|Open|Close|Price Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Start | 1/6/2021 | 1/27/2021 |21| $18 | $348 |$329|
| Trade Halt |1/28/2021|2/18/2021|21|$325|$41|$(284)|
| DFV + 50k |2/19/2021|3/9/2021|18|$41|$236|$195|

Next I looked at the price change related to volume for each Event.

Volume / Price change = Volume / abs (Close price - Open price)

abs = absolute value

This tells me how much volume was needed to change the price $1

As you can tell the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 3 is slightly less then Event 1. Also the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 2 is significantly less due to the trading halts imposed on retail investors.

&amp;#x200B;

| Event | Volume | Price Change | Volume / Price Change |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Start | 1,108,040,000 | $329 | 3,366,368 |
| Trade Halt | 569,480,000 | $(284) | 2,003,025 |
| DFV + 50k | 624,115,325 | $195 | 3,193,876 |

Finally I can calculate what my price target will be at the end of event 3 on 3/12/2021

I look at how much volume I have left to go on event 3 based on Event 1

Volume To-Go = Event 1 Volume - Event 2 Volume

I then take my volume to go and divide that by how much volume it has taken during event 3 to move the stock $1

Volume To-Go / Volume/Price change = (Event 1 Volume - Event 3 Volume) / (Event 3 Volume / Event 3 Close Price - Event 3 Open price)

This tell me how much I expect the stock to rise by the end Event 3 on 3/12/2021

&amp;#x200B;

| Volume To-Go | Volume To-Go / Volume/Price change | Current Price |Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021 |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| 483,924,675 | $152 | $236 | $388 |

Lastly, now that I have my expect price change I can calculate my PT for Friday 3/12/2021

**Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021 = Current Price + (Volume To-Go / (Volume/Price change)) = $388**

All the Data shown above has been taken from 3 month charts ; except 3/9/2021 which was taken around 1:15 pm CST on 3/9/2021 once the day closes I can re run this model if need be. Also everything was rounded to the closest whole number.

The whole scenario here is still so unprecedented ; as more volume and price action takes place I can update my models accordingly and make adjustments. But as we get closer to the apex of price I really think we could start seeing $100 ,$1,000 , maybe even $10,000 mid day price swings in either direction.

Some food for though that I might expand on later is so far during event 3 we are starting to see a smaller requirement of volume needed to change price. This separation could be a sign that significant price action could be taking place soon.

This is not financial advice ; I'm not a financial advisor ; I'm not saying to buy or sell.

**But based on historical trends $388 is where I expect to see this stock come Friday 3/12/2021.**

I mostly deal with large amounts of actual and theoretical data to create statistical models to forecast labor and material needs for my company.",PT for Friday 3/12/2021 $388,1.0,1615326335,Admirable-Surround11

33,m1h82o,"Think about it, most big movie releases during covid-19 have been split among numerous streaming platforms. That means you would have to subscribe to each one just for a single movie if there was nothing else you wanted to watch on that platform....

Disney+
Hulu
Netflix
HBO Max
Peacock
CuriosityStream
PrimeVideo
YoutubeTV 

Just to name a few. 

AMC could easily streamline this and have all movie releases on a single platform. New releases cycled in with rentals for older movies. Think about that. 

Now we just need to hope someone at AMC realizes this potential.
