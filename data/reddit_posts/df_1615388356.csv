1,m1zcsv,"Academy Sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139% earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40%. If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. 

ASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. 

This is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. 

Getting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions ""shaking out weak hands"" or GME's first pop. 

I understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.

In the recent days we've seen a beautiful increase in GME stock value. It looks like MOAS might be coming after all.

As we all know, many of you gum sucking apes will soon be getting  new pearly whites. Do your research and find a good dentist. Once you get your new chompers, you won’t need to eat bananas everyday, you’re eating steak and crayons from now on baby!

Going to a dentist is not the most exciting thing in the world and actually makes a lot of folks anxious. See some recommendations here if this is you:

## APPLE Inc. 🍎 (AAPL) +38% in mentions

Market Cap: $1.95 Trillion

I will save the introduction into this company as i’m sure all of you are aware of who Apple are.

Instead, I will cover why this is a good time to look at apple stock and what their future holds.

### Timing

At the start of this year, Apple stock was at $145 a share. It is currently down \~20% from that price, mostly due to the tech slump of the last few weeks.

It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t a company with a crazy valuation due to projected future earnings, it’s already an absolute cash cow with solid current earnings, which makes this a safer investment than some of the more speculative tech plays.

Furthermore, this all time high price is one I feel will be surpassed in the future, given the future plans I will discuss below.

### Future

Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans interact and work with computers. While not always at the forefront of the innovation curve, The company has been able to revolutionise and disrupt sectors with their products.

The reason this has been so tremendously successful for Apple, for so long, is the seamless integration between their products, the ‘ecosystem’, which means that in a world of continuously more sophisticated technology, Apple’s devices work and integrate seamlessly with each other, creating a highly rewarding customer experience.

This allows Apple to enter, or even create new markets *(think iPad or AirPods)* with a higher-than-usual success rate, while also being able to charge a higher premium for the Apple experience.

This higher success rate, along with big technology developments in the personal device space is the reason why I think Apple will sustain their position as a leading technology company.

**Augmented Reality**

Next up for Apple? mixed and augmented reality (MR and AR).

Augmented reality is the idea of overlaying projected imagery, graphics or instructions onto the real-world. Instagram face filters are an entertaining example of that, Mercedes’ current Sat Nav systems are a more useful use-case.

Apple are heavily investing into AR technology, with rumours of them releasing AR focussed glasses between later this year and 2022, future plans also suggest a 3 stage release of AR technology, starting with AR helmets and going all the way to contact lenses by 2030 *(this technology is closer than you think, look at this company who have working examples*[ *https://www.mojo.vision/*](https://www.mojo.vision/)*).*

**Apple car**

Slightly less sci-fi than AR, Apple has been working on a car since 2014, looking to release an autonomous driving model at around 2024.

I won’t go into too much detail here on this as there is already tons of content online to read through, but a successful car launch can provide another massive revenue stream for Apple to grow even further.

**Summary**

Strong future outlook, solid established earnings, a loyal consumer and a reduced current price make buying the world’s most popular stock a very interesting prospect.

While to some, the idea of AR glasses or an Apple car could sound like a gimmick, or yet another product that has cool technology but no uptake *(3D TVs anyone?),* try to think back to what you first thought of the iPad announcement, or the Apple watch. Both to me were products that seemed to have little use, but I was clearly proven wrong!",My algorithm tracks chatter and sentiment of stocks on social media.
