This is not DD

I think people don't realize that the retailers have more impact then they might think.
This means we should set the price for $GME.

The HFs have by all means the liquidity of Covering at 100k$ a share.

They have securities at over 50trillion dollars. So they can handle a share price of over 100k.

And remember there are stocks out there already at over 300k a share - Berkshire Hathaway. 

Also maybe think of an exit strategy.
Set your goal to 100k$ a share.
If you reach the 100k a share you could sell half of your shares and see if 100k was the peak or if it starts rising further . So you can sell the other half AFTER the peak.

If the peak is under your goal (100k in this case) then you can do the same. Sell your shares after the peak. Maybe even hold some.

There will be enough time. The Peak and the downfall won't happen in seconds or minutes or even hours. This will take longer.

Again this is not a DD.
This is my first time posting on here.

I just think this is a once in a lifetime chance to demand such things from the 1%.

If you don't think it will reach 100k a share that's ok.
As I said you can still sell after the peak. Because the price will probably stay at 80% of the peak for a week or two.

If you sell before the Peak you're literally giving away free money. Because you can't tell what the peak price will be. I just think 1k or even 10k are way too low.

If we all buy FD March 5th calls for AAL expiring this Friday slightly ITM, MM's will be forced to buy shares on the open market to cover, and shorts will be squeezed shitless.

**Previous Posts**

A few days ago, I alerted you beautiful fucking retards to the YUGE opportunities in airlines - specifically AAL - as the economy reopens and people will be dying to party in Miami Beach with their newly minted tendies over spring break. That night, Cramer told everyone to buy Southwest as a reopening play and dismissed AAL due to their balance sheet.

**Cramer Shilling Southwest Instead of AAL -** Aired Feb 22nd - what a retard 🙄

![video](tk6y537gonk61 ""Cramer is a Shill"")

**AAL** 🚀🌕

Since then, LUV is up only \~5.6% while AAL is up \~15%. And, the House passed the new stimmy which includes $15B for airlines, a significant portion will go to AAL as they rehire workers and repair their balance sheet. And, the J&amp;J vaccine is rolling out with a partnership with Merck to bring herd immunity quicker than expected.

$15B to airlines: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/coronavirus-stimulus-gives-airlines-15-billion-to-call-back-furloughed-workers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/coronavirus-stimulus-gives-airlines-15-billion-to-call-back-furloughed-workers.html)

**I am Balls Deep in AAL - This is not Financial Advice**

![img](n8l1x0ooink61 ""Position as of March 2nd 12:40 AM EST"")

**What is a Gamma Squeeze?**

A gamma squeeze starts when call options are sold by MM's who do not own shares they can sell to you at the strike price. Once you buy your call options, the MM's are forced to buy shares on the open market at any price to fulfill the call option they just sold to you. However, if too many call options were sold, the MM will have to buy shares on the open market at unbelievably high prices because they created so much demand.

This could go wrong if the MM just started shorting the shit out of the underlying stock. However, after a certain amount of time (without market manipulation,) there just won't be enough shares to short. And now, as the shorts start to cover, there is even more purchasing demand sending the price of the stock 🚀🌕

**AAL Short Interest**

Upon the latest market short report, as of Feb 12th, the short interest was 80M shares. However, if you have been watching Fintel, the short shares availablity has dropped from 3.3M a few days ago down to 2.4M last I checked. This means that short interest could be north of 100M shares.

Feb 12th Short Interest: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aal/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aal/short-interest)

Daily Trading Volume:

    Feb 22nd Volume: 99.94M
    Feb 23rd Volume: 78.82M
    Feb 24th Volume: 74.61M
    Feb 25th Volume: 65.57M
    Feb 26th Volume: 42.25M
    Mar 1st  Volume: 45.23M
    Mar 2nd  Volume: 14.96M as of 12:37 AM EST

**The Fucking Gamma Squeeze**

The daily volume has been well under 50M the past few days. If we collectively bought call options with 50M of underlying shares, this could be enough to force the gamma squeeze.

So, if we all collectively bought 100k x $21 , 150k x $22, and 250k x $23 call options expiring March 5th, this should be enough for a gamma squeeze. This will collectively require about $7.3M for the $21 calls, $4.05M for the $22 calls, and $2.25M for the $23 calls for a collective $13.6M.
