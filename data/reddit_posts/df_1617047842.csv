[BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/key-statistics?p=BAC), [PFE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/key-statistics?p=PFE), [T](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T/key-statistics?p=T), [TSM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/key-statistics?p=TSM), [AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL), [MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/key-statistics?p=MSFT) etc.

The market works very simply - when the crowd buys, prices go up and vice versa. The good thing about NO–ö is that it is cheap. As you can see below, exactly a year ago this forum had 1.1 million degenerates. Today we are 9.7 million. I turn to those 8.6 of the newcomers. –ïach of us knows what he is here for. Well, it's just 4.63B / 8.6M = 538 shares on average and we buy all the free float. It is not even necessary to buy the whole float to raise the price tenfold, but much much less as the companies shown above. I know some of you don't have so much money, but others have more. AVERAGE. Completely achievable. And your dreams come true.

Follow by the post analysis -- if the Emergency Use Approval is granted then there might be more upside. From my understanding, it is likely to give more on positive side if EUA is approved. It really is determining how likely it is going to be approved from now on

I‚Äôm an 18 year old who has no experience in investing and I want to get going ‚Äúearly‚Äù.

My first instinct is to invest in mutual funds because I was told that they are safe and the most reliable from my personal finance teacher in high school. If this is the right path to take I don‚Äôt know how to even start buying mutual funds.

I have about $2000 saved up from a few months working and I wanna get that money working for me!

Can I please get an explanation on how to search for mutual funds, how to buy them safely, how one would go about choosing a safe one (my teacher said look for ones with an average of 7% growth over a long time).

I also would like to get into the stock market. I just bought a TSLA stock and would like to see what happens with it. But I really have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.

I‚Äôm pretty much looking for someone to give me a rundown for an entry level noob to get a good explanation on how to get started into investing.

Mass sell off tanked it down to half price.  Large block trades would've stopped the short squeeze, correct?  Or at least slowed it down considerably?

Yet today, it was crazy.  More movement then any other day I had seen.  Trading patterns that are abnormal but very similar to gme or amc, looks like two parties battling back and forth.  Ended at a nice 45.01 also which reminds me of our fight.  

Think maybe this ties in to gme somehow?  I'm thinking someone wants to push it down to a lower value and someone's trying to keep it afloat.  Any hedgies have this as a large part of their portfolio?  Thinking they get margin called if it hits to low.

1. Buffet or some other whale announces they bought the block. **Action:** no questions asked, RKT will actually rocket up, hit the buy button as fast as you can
2. short interest drop significantly - means shorts have used the block to exit and RKT will rocket up slowly. **Action:** Hit the buy button after your finish your shit.
3. short interest stays still or goes up - means shorts are doubling down. **Action:** Hit the buy button when you feel like it and wait for the dark pool whale to start their short squeeze.

70,mfytie,"Bill Hwang ranks right up there with the greatest autists of all time. This smooth brain turned $200 million into $15 billion in only 7 years. He turned $1.5 billion into $5 billion in 2020 alone, and then proceeded to turn $5 billion into $15 billion in the first three weeks of 2021. This motherfucker was posting some of the greatest gain porn of all time. However - unfortunately for his bananas üçå - it appears Bill Hwang is in fact a loyal WSB lurker. This reeeee was running 5x leverage while single handedly manufacturing short squeezes and massive gains in companies like $GSX, $VIAC and $DISCA. THIS APE ü¶ç WAS LITERALLY MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SQUEEZING THE SHORTS WHILE BEING LEVERAGED TO THE TITS. Look at the gains in $GSX, $VIAC and $DISCA. He managed to pump these multi-billion dollar companies 100%+ in weeks - anonymously - because apparently he found some loophole where he didn't have to report &gt; 10% ownership (usually required).

Bill Hwang was on top of the world. The amount of cocaine and hookers this guy was running through must've been insane. But, Chief Autist Hwang forgot a very important part of the autist handbook: Mr. Margin always comes to collect. Instead of taking some bananas üçå off the table like a big brain ape, Chief Autist Hwang realized this is a casino and just kept buying more and more shares of $GSX, $VIAC and $DISCA on the way up. Bill Hwang didn't just blow up his own fund either. Credit Suisse was down 14% today because of this retard. $VIAC and $DISCA tanked 40%+ last week, both extending losses today.

BILL HWANG IS MY HERO. I always wondered what would happen if we put one of the 9.5 million degenerates in this sub in charge of a multi-billion dollar fund. Welp...turns out we got our answer thanks to Bill Hwang. Just as I thought, it would be a total shit show consisting of infinite leverage, short squeezes and margin calls big enough to put a smile on the faces of the 2008 Lehman Brothers Risk Management Department.

But he warned of a doomsday scenario in which accelerating inflation deepens a bond market sell-off, sends stocks tumbling and stokes unrest among retail investors hurt in the process."" I have no clue who the guy is - he might be an asshole for all I know. But there is nothing unwarranted about what he  said.

95,mfz4xk,"I am going to breakdown my bullish case for a subsidiary of Analytix Insight (ALY:TSX.V, ATIFX:OTCQB) and why Market Wall may be a diamond in the rough. Roughly 80% of my portfolio is now invested into this company and I am creating this DD to discuss my analysis with others and see if I am correct in my analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

Analytix Insight owns 49% of MarketWall and Intesa Sanpaolo (2nd Largest bank in Europe by Market Cap) owns 33%. The other 18% is currently owned by MarketWall employees. MarketWall developed an online financial brokerage, called InvestoPro, using AI and data analytics to complete research on companies in real time. 

&amp;#x200B;

InvestoPro already draws an audience of over 2.5 million monthly users through all its channels and it has emerged as a new financial content provider by offering users investment information and editorial content designed to increase investor knowledge. As a Samsung Electronics partner, MarketWall‚Äôs financial apps are preloaded on certain Samsung devices in Europe. These initiatives contribute to InvestoPro‚Äôs consumer brand awareness in Europe and will benefit its launch. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's new?

&amp;#x200B;

TORONTO, ON ‚Äì March 29, 2021 ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence company, AnalytixInsight Inc. (‚ÄúAnalytixInsight‚Äù, or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (TSX-V: ALY; OTCQB: ATIXF), announces that InvestoPro SIM (‚ÄúInvestoPro‚Äù), the online financial broker of its FinTech affiliate, MarketWall, has received regulatory approval from CONSOB (Commissione Nazionale per le Societ√† e la Borsa), the Italian financial markets regulator.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.analytixinsight.com/companynews/analytixinsight-announces-investopro-has-received-regulatory-approval-as-online-financial-broker](https://www.analytixinsight.com/companynews/analytixinsight-announces-investopro-has-received-regulatory-approval-as-online-financial-broker)

&amp;#x200B;

The news we heard this morning confirms that InvestoPro will now allow users to trade stocks, options, and derivatives in Italy and later in other European countries.

Price Analysis

&amp;#x200B;

[Source 4 Snippet](https://preview.redd.it/xq9nt0br41q61.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfffff79b4374b5916a79a118e1271d05157d1af)

AnalytixInsight owns 49% of Market Wall and many other companies but only has a market cap of \~80 MM. Currently, AnalytixInsight intends to spinout/unlock the value of its MarketWall holdings in an IPO or in another strategy to be determined (Source 3). 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the evaluations of other comparative apps (Source 4), we can see that a conservative estimate of a market cap of 1-2 Billion for Market Wall if it IPO'd today would be reasonable. This is based on the both the market cap and the current active user base on each platform. Market Wall has an active user base of 2.5M users which is somewhere in the middle of the bottom venture capital stock trading companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since the current price of ALY is around $1 with a market cap of \~80 MM, we can approximate that their market cap would grow by about half of the market cap of MarketWall (Since AnalytixInsight owns 49% of MarketWall). 

&amp;#x200B;

With a conservative market cap, we are looking at a potential growth of $1 \* $1 Billion / 80 MM \* 49% = $6.13

&amp;#x200B;

If we are being more speculative with a market cap of 2 Billion this comes to $12.25.

&amp;#x200B;

This basically estimates that the price of ALY could be around 6.13-12.25 depending on the market cap. There is huge upside potential here and almost no downside now that the brokerage has been approved and the company has indicated that their intention is to IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very bullish on this stock and currently own over 10k shares which is over 80% of my small portfolio. Let me know if I missed anything in my analysis.
