85,lxjl3g,"Ocugen profit potential

I thought I’d put together some rough estimates of what Ocugen could make here. It’s a bit wordy but bare with me here and let’s establish some facts first:
 
- Ocugen is marketed as 2 doses. 

- Ocugen can only sell Covaxin in US market  
 
- Covaxin is being sold at a 40-50% profit margin at a cost price of $3-4 in India, we’ll use 40% at $3 which gives us a cost price of $1.80 and a profit margin of $1.20 per dose as a minimum.  

- Ocugen keep 45% of all profits, this means at $1.20 margin per dose, Ocugen would keep $0.56 profit per dose at $3 selling price. It’ll likely be higher than this in the US market, up to $9 would still be cheaper than J&amp;J who are selling at $10 per dose.
 
- Ocugen could make $0.54 - $1.62 per dose if they sell at $3 - 9  

- Covaxin unlikely to beat Pfizer/J&amp;J for market share but could do very well in child vaccine space as it may be the first approved for children.  

Conservative sales scenario:  

Covaxin pick up 10% of the market in adult sales, which would be around 21M people at 2 doses each = 42M doses. Making $0.54 - $1.62 per dose each would mean $22 - 66M for adult market. 

Covaxin should do much better in child vaccines, 30% market share could be easily achieved, that’s also around 21M children at $0.54 - $1.62 per dose 
Another $22 - 66M for child market. 

Putting the conservative figures at $44 - 132m assuming 10% adult and 30% child market share for COVAXIN.   

A best case scenario: 

Covaxin could also do significantly better if it’s pricing itself aggressively and shown to be good against variants. It could pick up 30% adult market share and 60% child market share at a best case scenario  

That would mean $66 - 200M for adult market and a  
$44 - 130M child market. Bringing the best case scenario to $110 - $330M in profits.  

That gives it a big range of $44M in profits in a conservative scenario and $330M in a best case. This would likely be yearly, as vaccines will be needed for some time.",Ocugen profit potential 🚀🚀,0.73,1614861619,Appropriate-Boss8629
