To: All Hands 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

Subj: Message to All Hands 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

1. For decades, short selling hedgies have ransacked the American economy and employed naked shorting techniques to decimate child hood companies that we all know and love. The time has come to end their reign of terror. On your young shoulders rest the hopes of all ape-kind🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍. 

2. When given the word, we will cross the line of departure and close with those forces that choose to fight and destroy them. Our fight is not with the pension funds and responsible investors, nor the hedge funds that have allied to reinforce our efforts. We will move swiftly and aggressively against those that resist and treat all others with decency, demonstrating chivalry and soldierly compassion for those who have endured a lifetime of hedgie short selling, and share our tendies with groups in need. 

3. Short ladder attacks, SEC treachery, and the use of false narratives can be expected, as can other unethical tactics. Take it all in stride. Be the hunter and BUY. When the price falls, BUY MORE and dig in! Use good judgement and act in the best interests of WSB!

4. You are the worlds most feared and trusted open forum trading force! Engage your brain, trust the numbers, and disable that sell button until lift off! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Share your courage with each other! As we enter the uncertain terrain north above $100 for AMC and $1000 for GME. Keep faith with apes on your left and right, and friendly whales overhead. Trade with a happy heart and strong spirit. 

5. For the mission’s sake, our tendies sake, and the sake of those who suffered in 2008, HODL!!! Demonstrate to the world there is “No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy” than a WSB APE. 

6. Support fellow Military Veteran Apes at https://gigo.org/hudson-river-swim/supporter/recon-bymarcelinofigueroa/?fbclid=IwAR22ExVCJff2jj52KvG\_yrVx2AlkwWXCBqIw2\_QvyYKnzv1utntP8t3hTfI

81,mf4yb7,"Every time I bought stocks in the last 3 years, they went down almost instantly! GME is the first stock I ever bought that shot straight up after buying! 

So I basically went around my whole portfolio and sold 95% of each stock to poor into GME. Now after all that work, my GME stocks are down in the red! 

When that happened, I thought I’m right back where I started from again. In the red! But I feel a different Aura with GME, I feel like I made a great decision but still get overwhelmed with its volatility. 

I didn’t buy GME for short, I thought this is a great long hold opportunity and I’m excited about the future and bullish about the stock! 

All my other stocks were good picks for long run but I think GME beats all of them hands down. 

So if you bought GME and you’re down to, I hope you’ll get encouraged because, most of you bought on a whim based on other people’s DD and there DD became your DD. Does this make you a dummy? No it makes you a special kind of retard, a unique retard! 

Smarter folk put in all the hard work (DD) and your riding on there knowledge. So your Skeptical right now, I get it! But since you now hold, don’t throw it all away when you see massive drops, instead buy more! If you can’t buy more, simply find something to do other then watching it all day, because that can discourage you and you might pull the trigger to sell and lose it all. 

I hope this encourages you and you have an awesome day! Tomorrow is a new day and it will be blessed no matter what happens.
