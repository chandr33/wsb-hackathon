I'm gonna start working on this week's DD at some point tomorrow.  But for the first time in a couple of months, I'm not specifically seeing a stonk that I look at and go ""people need to learn about this like right now for maximum effort"".  So I'm going to put it to a vote of sorts.  Your options (that I might ignore if something really catches my eye) are:

&amp;#x200B;

* $NVTA
* $CVS
* $NNDM
* $RYCEY
* $RKUNY (which was going to be this Friday's, but then it assploded today so the ""wow"" factor is gone)
* $ISRG
* $APPH
* $SKLZ
* $PRCH

I'm proposing we take all of our money out of the banks all on the same day. Sure it's a meme, but so was GameStop before it became a reality.
