6,lxqsr6,"Hey everyone. I just talked to a Fidelity rep because my transfer got hung up. Here is what I learned. 

1. Robinhood did not allow transfers into a joint account but that has changed as of yesterday. If you are transferring into a joint account so that your wife and her bull have better access to your junk stocks, that can now be processed and proceed. I wish them well in their voyage to pound-town. 
2. Fidelity cannot hold any C-WORD. 
3. If you have any options positions that will complicate and delay your transfer. 
4. If you have any Margin in play that will ALSO complicate and delay your transfer. 

The rep was polite but clear that there have been a LOT of transfers lately. Be patient with the humans you talk to. They legit want to help.",Robinhood --&gt; Fidelity update from the trenches,0.87,1614880556,philoponeria

36,lxqx5s,"$RKT the perfect storm is brewing relating to a short squeeze. 

3/3/2021; the short sellers sold the shares so far down it put the stock into Short Sale Restriction. Meaning short sellers can just hammer the bid today, and an uptick rule now applies. The 10-year treasury just went up, so this mean the stock won't be going up today either. Now on Friday 3/5/2021, the last day to buy the stock to be qualified for the special interest dividend the uptick rule and short sale restriction applies. 

Shorts can't hammer the bids, and if the 1B in purchase would start it would be tomorrow. As a share holder you'd have to own the shares pass payout date to be on record (correct me if I'm wrong please). 

$RKT has such a strong following we need those paper hands out, and long holders to limit the availability of the float and shares.

Short-term bullish on $RKT Long-term BULLISH on $RKT. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please comment if there are any thing I may be missing, because as long as RKT is red, FRIDAY is GREEN!

But I would like you to read this in particular:  [Melvin Capital Improves From GameStop Reddit Struggle - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-04/melvin-capital-improves-from-gamestop-reddit-struggle) .

&amp;#x200B;

Please note the following, which the commentator makes out to be a potential strategy of Plotkin's going forward: 

&gt;Scour Reddit to see what stock retail investors are rallying around, sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just before the end of a quarter, buy a few listed puts on that stock.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just after the end of the quarter, but before your [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000248/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) filing [deadline](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), sell the puts and buy a ton of stock instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;File your 13F, indicating that you’re short (via puts), even though you are currently long.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reddit, which likes the stock anyway, will see that you are short, get angry and decide to squeeze you by rocketing the stock to the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now you are rich.

Draw your own conclusions. In my opinion, this means that Reddit has now gained the ability to raise a stock price just by talking about it enough.
