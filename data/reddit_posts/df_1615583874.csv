28,m3rizx,"What would the ratings on stocks be if they actually traded based on fundamentals?  Well lets find out:

The list of stocks are all companies I like.  They are all on my list of stocks to watch for wheel trades.  These are all companies that I would want to own if the price was right.

&amp;#x200B;

Since stock prices are usually based on perception of future performance, for each stock I looked up its estimated price earnings for 2021.  I ignored 2020 completely.  If it is a spec stock expected to loose money in 2021 I estimated its first profitable year in say 2022.  If I thought the CNBC estimate for 2021 was good I used it.  Otherwise I upped it a little or lowered it a little based on my opinion of future earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

I also used CNBC's numbers for past earnings to estimate what I thought the growth rate for the next few years would be.  Again I ignore 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

I then find a price target of earnings \* 2 \* growth rate.  The only exception was Hasbro which is a dividend stock.  

&amp;#x200B;

I then calculated a price I would want to own the stock at which is usually about 70% of price target or 1.4 \* earnings \* growth.

&amp;#x200B;

If a stock is trading at PE of more than 2 times growth rate it is rated a SELL

If a stock is trading at a PE between 1.4 and 2 times growth it is rated a HOLD

If a stock is trading under 1.4 growth it is rated a buy.

If it is trading at a PE of under its growth I rated it a STRONG BUY.

Other than Hasbro I did not take dividends, revenue, or assets under consideration.  This was a simple calculation.  Therefore THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN DD BEFORE BUYING, SELLING, OR HOLDING ANY STOCK!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I did not take squeezes into consideration they are ONLY based on future fundes.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the results will be SHOCKING!

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I used excel I know I suck.

50,m3rmfv,"I've read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls, particularly high multiple calls. I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the üöÄ with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options ""naked"" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.
This is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge.

I think this should be bigger news with most Americans receiving $1,400 next week.  Some people mention it is priced in but an inflow of some significant part of  the stimulus checks ($400 billion) flowing into the market can't be priced in.  It isn't news - it is actual money hitting the market.

I saw good news on CFRX this morning premarket and i figured it cant not go up so i bought some calls

started off with about 10 calls, then started averaging down thinking a reversal is around the corner

started buying  more calls and realized i ran outta money when RH told me to deposit funds  
i looked at my dogecoins and saw the loss and decided to sell it all just to buy more CFRX calls  
i think this is where karma got me, maybe i shouldn't have sold dawgcoin because it started going up right after i sold it, but whatever

bought another 11 calls and then RH sent me another notice saying i ran outta buying power

i then decided to go look at what my savings account had, and to my surprise i had $117 and i felt fuckin lucky, that i bought 2 more calls  
i was even thinking of calling my mom for some money to buy more calls 

i got 23 calls rn but im at a loss, maybe i shouldnt have sold my dawgcoins haha

anyways, i think the company will reach 10$ by the end of this year, whenever that is anyways

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not certain at all.  
A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub.

 **TL;DR: Do not fucking hang on to dates and give others false hopes so they don't trigger the big red self destruct button when shit does not pan out they way you fucks fantasized.**

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What is March 19 ? 

A: Quadruple Witching

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Is it a guaranteed liftoff date and should you put your orders in for Lambos on 20 March ? 

A: No

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

But why shouldn't we latch on to 19 March...

Well, imagine all the hedgies are in a circle formation and collectively walking this formation down the road. 

Q: What are they hiding in center of this formation and kicking down the road ?

A: A time bomb (shorted/counterfeit shares).

Now these hedgies are told, if they *leave the formation* (cover their positions) they will be *shot* (suffer huge losses) because when they leave the formation, the apes will be able to see the time bomb and become even more retarded.

Now each time one you retards throws a *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *card* (sell GME) a hedgie can pounce on it and run away from the time bomb.

**Problem:**

Now when you give the young apes false hopes of with these dates, they grab onto their tiny nuts and wait for the ""GMEday"". And when it turns out to be a &lt;100% gain day; they freak out and throw *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *cards.* 

**Solution:**

HODL, that's right ! Just HODL. Trust the numbers and trust the process. There is no way these capping shitbags have covered their positions... read the DDs by apes with brains that have more wrinkles than mine.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:
