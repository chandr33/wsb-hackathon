I can not believe that the lady who worked there was super old!!!! She barely could walk, I could literally cry seeing her smiling face and how kind and helpful she was, she spoke very little English, I think she was Mexican. As a super hard working person I respect ✊🏽 highly anyone who works hard, AND in THAT AGE!!! Omg! I feel horrible that she obviously does not have money to be able to retire!!!! She had to work late at night running the big laundry place! 😭 Today or tonight (or any day/night that is her work shift) I’m going there to give her a $200 cash 💵 as a gift 💝 🎁 to show appreciation and a respect ✊🏽 to that human being. ❤️
If I get a picture of her, I’ll post it here as a reply.
Wishing you all the best ❤️

ive seen only a few mentions of this major price fluxuation during the freeze and nobody has been able to explain it. 

this seems like too major of a detail to overlook and if you ask me, all of this ""news articles released story before the price crashed"" is stealing the spotlight for something that could be more important information 

so does ANYBODY know what happened after the drop yesterday?

54,m2q0o2,"If you’re newer to trading on margin I want you to be aware of this.  I learned the hard way yesterday.  Companies set margin requirements for each stock. Most stocks are 33% per TDA.  They may have a special requirement if it’s new or if it’s generally volatile.  The good news is this.  If there’s a special requirement, you have $100 balance &amp; you try to buy $100... it just won’t go through. BUT, if they put an additional special requirement because of some immediate reason
(As in AMC the last few days) this is NOT calculated prior to your trade.  Per a TDA call yesterday “The computer knows the standard requirement &amp; the longer term special requirement.  It calculates this before the trade goes in.  It can’t see the additional requirement till the trade is done. So, it’s only till after your trade that you margin show a very large in you margin available.

I went from a $14k margin balance to -$41k margin balance from a 400 share AMC trade.  I just sold 500 shares of XL (DD &amp; I love the stock. We should squeeze it).  I went from -$41k margin to
+$44k margin balance.

70,m2q2w0,"This one is pretty simple for all you beautiful retarded banana loving apes out there. Remember when the GME short squeeze was called out months in advance? This is where we are at right now. This stock has deep fucking value and I can prove it very easily.

To my newbie investors out there, here’s some financial advice from a non financial advisor, buy CLOV stock. I put stars next to the most important points if you don’t want to read this whole thing, but I encourage you to do so anyway.

Why? because it’s extremely undervalued, and you may be asking how do I know this? It’s very simple, there is one number that, if it’s lower than a stock price means the stock is potentially under valued. This is called the BVPS, book value per share.

****** What is the book value per share? Book value per share (BVPS) is the ratio of equity available to common shareholders divided by the number of outstanding shares. This figure represents the minimum value of a company's equity and measures the book value of a firm on a per-share basis. (copied and pasted from investopedia.com) 

***** Still confused? Well, imagine you have a company called ApezTown. You sells bananas and other ape related things to apes. Let’s say you have $10million in hard cash, $0 in debt, and $90million in assets. Even if your business is complete garbage (which it isn’t)  you’re company is AT least worth $100million dollars because of your cash and assets. So if you have 10 million shares, they SHOULD BE WORTH AT LEAST $10 per share. Otherwise it’s like buying a $100 bill with a $10 bill.

Often, a stock may have a share price that is higher than its BVPS. This is because of demand, and expectations. If you’re a company, for example TSLA,  and you are the literal future of an entire trillion dollar sector, your share price will likely exceed your BVPS because the market expects you to grow substantially.

****** Why does this matter for CLOV stock? Because, right now CLOV is trading at around $8 dollars a share. Can you guess the BVPS? It’s fucking 38.55.

Now we apes may be retarded, but this looks QUITE UNDERVALUED.
For my more experienced investors, and even some newbies out there. You may have heard of CLOV. Afterall it’s supported by a legendary investor, and is actually not a bad business. In fact, the share price of CLOV, if anything, should be HIGHER than the BVPS, because it is also a business with high potential like Tesla.

You may be asking, how the fuck did it get beat down so hard then? If you haven’t scrambled to find enough ape dollars to buy the stock yet, very good question. Long story short, the fucking hedges. And I got proof.

That’s fucking right, they don’t know when to stop, they won’t learn their lesson, and now they’re shorting CLOV.

A short seller report by Hindenburg research led to a decrease in price, coupled with a recent market meltdown. You can actually google the short interest of CLOV and see its been increasing for quite a while. By the way, most of the short seller report is inaccurate and misleading, and is mostly an attack on Palihapitiya, a legendary investor, WHO ACTUALLY BOUGHT GAME STOP WITH US BECAUSE HE HATED HEDGE FUNDS AND THEN USED THE PROFITS TO DONATE. a true fucking legend if you ask me, but i digress.

Nevertheless, the short seller report lacked much to say about CLOV itself, they don’t dare touch CLOV’s business model because they know it’s successful. 

Now taking all this into consideration, CLOV is worth, AT LEAST ~$38. But wait, there’s more.

CLOV isn’t a fucking dead business. It has the support of influential investors who invested their own personal capital. It has institutional ownership, it has potential. It has motherfucking DEEPFUCKINGVALUE. 

I may be a retarded ape 🦍. But when I see a guaranteed 5x play minimum, THAT ALSO HAS SHORTS and HEDGES to burn. I go fucking ape shit.

Right now CLOV is very under valued, and Uncle joe is giving out a stimmy soon.

75,m2q39j,"Disclaimer this is not retarded and I’m financial advice- wait
Yesterday made one thing clear to me

A short of 800,000 shares = $190 price drop
We still ended the day in the green - at the time of the ladder attack there were 200,000 more shares that could have been shorted, 200,000 = 1/4 of 800,000 so 1/4 of 190 is ~47.5~
$47.5 is all the ammo they had left, I understand that available shorts become more available each day, but every stock they short, they will have to buy back, which could cause a price jump up relative to how it went down, and if they make a daily habit of shorting to keep price down, the stock lenders are just going to up their interest rates

These stock boards are suddenly full of parents coming to the realization that they're ALL spending money AT THE SAME PLACE. The same realization hit people on message boards when Netflix went full-streaming with ""Watch Now."" But Netflix only has a thousand titles and some DVDs?! Why would anyone subscribe to that? Some older folks here will remember these convos.

Now we have a powerful gaming platform played by youngsters that parents everywhere are paying for. But all I hears is $45 overvalues the company. A company nearly every parent is already paying for...a company that's just partnered with TENCENT to operate a ""localized version of its platform"" in CHINA. Plus, it has the added benefit of starting out a meme stock, which is just free advertising for its products.

Stay out if you want to, but this sucker is climbing with or without you. I never understand why people are so reluctant to invest in things they actually use daily. You're not special--if you use the product, millions of others likely do too.

As for the haters--my best guess? Bears looking for a lower point of entry. Push the market down, buy in at $45 or less, watch it go up over time, profit both ways. It's literally what they do for survival. Don't buy into it. If you like the product, buy the stock.
