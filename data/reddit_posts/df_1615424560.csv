I love going down these rabbit holes so I decided to look for anything that may connect the two further. I noticed their names are both the same amount of letters. So naturally I lined them up above one another and started counting the number of letters between each letter of each name. Like this:  


D - a - v - i - d       B - a - s - z - u - c - k - i

6 - 0 - 9 - 4 -15     6 - 0 - 7 -14-12-1-10-16

J - a - m - e - s       H - a - l - l - i - d - a - y  


I then tried to figure out if the numbers meant anything, like a zip code, phone number or whatever. Couldn't match it to anything significant so I thought what the hell and just added them all up.  


6 + 0 + 9 + 4 + 15 + 6 + 0 + 7 + 14 + 12 + 1 + 10 + 16  


Guess what it added up to? Yup, 100! As in 💯!

I'm no numerologist but this has to mean something. The Oasis seems like what Roblox strives to become. I can imagine a world not too long from now where we all jack in to a VR MMO daily and play our favorite games with friends using avatars we persistently customize. It's an exciting future!

We just had the AMC earnings call.  So if you want numbers, facts like losses where not as bad as expected, 2.2 billion being raised and so on.  I am sure someone has that covered.  My purpose is to go over some qualitative factors that so called ""experts"" have gotten wrong, dead wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Streaming will kill the movie theater is a myth.**

This is the stupidest shit I have ever heard.  First let's talk about one of the biggest markets out there for movies:  China.  Disney+ and Netflix do not currently stream in China.  Disney has bumped it's head several times trying to get it's service in China.  But censorship issues and the fact that China demands any foreign business entity work through a Chinese based company makes doing business a pain in the ass.

There have been only 3 movies released only on streaming services.  Disney has show a lack of confidence in streaming overtaking the theater going experience as their major releases are still slated for the theater.

Let's talk revenues and tracking success.  Studios have to negotiate with streaming services for how much they will get for releasing and running their title on that service.  That means potentially making less than if they relied on traditional theater releases.  Still not with me?  Okay so how much does a studio make off a family of four watching their movie on a streaming service versus what they make when they have to go the theater.  Bunch of friends come over to see a movie is anyone taking tickets are charging for those people to watch?  Nope that's lost money.  I'll put it to you this way.  Notice how a lot of bars don't show UFC on Pay Per View or major boxing matches?  Well they have to negotiate how much they have to pay to run it because Pay Per View knew there would be a lot of people watching it and potentially shorting them on the deal.  They were so gun shy about it they demanded restrictive prices, to the point that most bars won't or wouldn't do it.

As for tracking success.  Well after the weekend the reports from the box offices indicate to studios which projects are worth a sequel and which projects they take a bath on.  They know what stars are marketable, what audiences will likely want to see based on viewing habits and so on.  Sure Netflix and other services let them know what people are watching.  But Netflix has a ton of stuff to watch, old movies, shows, original content.  Factor in the sense there is no rush to see the new release because you can see it ""anytime.""  No business wants market information coming in at a trickle or potential revenue caps.  Streaming is nice but it's not the movie theater killer.

&amp;#x200B;

2.    **The theater experience is over myth.**

We are coming out of a pandemic.  Everyone wants out of their private prisons that have become their home.  Home has blended into a Kafkaesque nightmare of work, school/childcare, entertainment, and sensory deprivation tank.  How much do you think parents with kids will pay for an hour and thirty minutes of silence where the kids sit still?  How much do you think they would pay for a night out doing dinner and a movie while a babysitter handles the kids?

Maybe that doesn't ring true for you.  You have no kids, so not a problem right?  Well how about the shared communal experience of going to the movies?  There is something to be said about cheering with an audience, laughing and feeling moments of dread together.  I recall a great story told to me about a family member who say Jaws in the theater, that moment when the dead guy came through the hole in the boat, yeah they pretty much crapped their pants.  The whole concept of a blockbuster comes from crowds at the theater seeing an incredible movie and the ensuing public frenzy.  That same feeling isn't going to happen with streaming.  Sure we all talk about our favorite Netflix series.  But remember when John Wick II and III hit the theaters, remember Endgame?

Finally how about just escaping the house?  How long have most people been locked up?  How many of them do you think have a new or at least long lasting appreciation about being able to go out and do things?  A lot of theaters are offering cocktail service, so does AMC ([https://www.amctheatres.com/food-and-drink/macguffins](https://www.amctheatres.com/food-and-drink/macguffins)).  So go out have a brew, watch a movie, feel like you did something that breaks up the trend of sitting on your butt at home.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  **Malls and landlords will play ball with AMC.**

Perhaps you haven't noticed but a lot of anchor stores (Macy's, JC Penny's, Sears, Nordstroms) are closing up.  These stores were major pulls to get foot traffic into the malls.  They cause incidental sales like you stroll out of Macy's and decide you are in the mood for Annie's Pretzels or whatever.  Well these stores are vanishing and leaving empty space.  I've watched malls get creative in my area with revitalizing that space with limited success.  They have chopped up the space to make it for smaller stores, restaurants, annexes for community colleges and even a server farm.  These all fail to command the same drawing power to bring people the the mall.  The movie theater is one of the last remaining major draws.  You go to see a movie, you decide to get something to eat before the movie, maybe check out Sunglass Hut and buy something.  Malls and the landlords know they won't be able to maintain occupancy if they lose all the major draws.  So they will cut theaters like AMC a break and restructure any debt.

Don't believe me?  Let me tell you about the local mall that lost all it's anchor stores and the theater shut down.  It right now has less than 10% occupancy.  One major store was turned into a boxing gym.  Another section became a Gold's Gym that shutdown because Planet Fitness opened up near by and crushed it.  There is a Sbarro's, Ruby Tuesday, a palm reader, and two stores got combined into one bouncy castle daycare/birthday/arcade monstrosity.  The mall does not work without major draws.  The landowner eats a shitload of debt for a near empty mall, because they are still paying up for utilities and commercial taxes.

For malls owned by major commercial property holding companies, they have pressure to remain attractive to REITs.  That means keeping the money coming in, posting profits, showing growth.  Attracting new businesses to replace the lost anchor stores is critical to that.  That means having the foot traffic to justify a new business coming in and setting up shop.  That won't happen if you cast off a big pull for people to come to the mall.

As for stand alone theaters, which there are some.  The question becomes what to replace them with?  There are only so many Bass Pro Shops that can be opened up in a state.  Only so many companies want to come in, completely renovate the space, pay rent and then finally open for business.  There is already a business there with a history of paying, a history of generating revenue, a history of being a good tenet.

The sound of fucking these hedgies and getting me some motha fukin' tendies in the process was too good to pass up.  So I took all they money could and dumped it into GME, right around $4.5K (50 shares @ 91.70).  Even if I lose it all, I don't fuckin' care.  I ain't no paper hands bitch.  

I heard about the Volkswagen deal from 2008 (yeah I'm that autistic that I knew nothing about it) and it sparked an interest so I looked at the chart for it and read about it.  I know shit is completely different, so back off, like I stated earlier I'm a smooth brained autist that knows nothing.  However, I couldn't help but notice a small similarity in the graphs.

How many times will the ""big guys"" agitate the bees nest. How many times will ""they"" coordinate against retail without any repercussions? How many times will they call retail ""dumb money"" until finally a wrinkle is formed and retail attacks back. 

There is no we. Every one of us will back stab each other. That doesn't mean each of us can't have the same goal: Getting paid. And getting paid requires some type of intelligence and some type of strategy. I am a nobody, and I can't give you specific dates to do anything. And following a rando internet dude is probably a bad idea. But I can say if you got some sense, you can ""tell"" when the right time to place your ""bet"".

86,m2eeyr,"I know that hedge funds are shorting the stock, borrowing and selling it high and then attempting to buy it back low, but I'm wondering how they were able to manipulate the stock today to make it drop over $100? Did they buy an ample amount of regular shares only to sell them all at once, hoping it will trigger stop losses and paper hands? This is my guess at the time being. I know the reason it recovered is because we like the stock and bought the dip, but I'm wondering the logistics behind the dip.

Also another question I have is is this stock being short squeezed or gamma squeezed at this point? Or are we just forcing out the shorts (like we saw today) so the stock is able to go up without other people stopping it.

I guess what I'm looking for is someone with an abundance of knowledge on what is currently happening, I am very interested in this, and am actually working on a research paper on this for college, so if there's anyone out there who would be willing to answer some questions as they come up, I would be very appreciated.",How did the price of GME drop today?

6 - I have 100 percent, Cathie like conviction, that this stock is significantly undervalued.

7 - Reasons.  1 - Wall St Hates Dan Gilbert.  Doesn’t have the pedigree of the fancy boys.  2 - as a result they have shorted RKT since day 1.  3 - RKT is making so much money it makes Elon jealous.  4 - Fintech??  RKT is the definition of making an extremely painful process like getting a mortgage, extremely easy.  5 - market share?  They are number 1, by far.  6 - New business??
