I want to start off this DD with the standard statements. This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock. 

Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‘96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‘90’s watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early. 

Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that’s a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ). 

The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I’m watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I’m getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point. 

$TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid. 

[https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars](https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars). 

TL&amp;DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don’t. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*

[https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range)

Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15)

On Feb 15 Ford dissolved their stake in a different LiDAR company, Velodyne. Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

In addition to all of the big arrows pointing towards this company to be the chosen one for autonomous driving sensors, Seval Oz ( a bad bitch who is a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry ) has just joined the Board of Directors for this company. 

[https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Microvision+%28MVIS%29+granted+US+patent+number+10%2C935%2C640+titled+%22Multiplexed+LIDAR+transceiver%22+-+PatentGrants/18064276.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Microvision+%28MVIS%29+granted+US+patent+number+10%2C935%2C640+titled+%22Multiplexed+LIDAR+transceiver%22+-+PatentGrants/18064276.html)

MVIS was just officially granted a patent on it’s tech. On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.  With all that being said I just really like the stock. MVIS go moon.",$MVIS DD,1.0,1614711241,maraudingchemist

32,lw9lbu,"As we all know, Ryan Cohen ***loves*** tweeting cryptically. Recently he posted a picture of a Mcdonald's Ice Cream cone and a Frog emoji 🐸 and GME's price doubled. I'm not seeing many people talk about what his tweet actually means. [Link to RC's Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289)

Mcdonald's ran a promotion and served 25 cent ice cream cones for ""International Happiness Day"" which falls on [March 20th](https://twitter.com/MusicalxFelony/status/1365913653862682627/photo/1).

The picture of the ice cream cone is taken from a [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-near-you-with-working-ice-cream-machine-mcbroken-website-2020-10?r=MX&amp;IR=T). TLDR: Someone made a website of broken McDonald's ice cream machine locations, and the website ***crashed*** because it had so much attention. Could also infer that GME is not broken/going bankrupt, hence the Ice cream, and the soft serve ice cream ""squeezing"" out of the machine.

What about the Frog though? Well, March 20th is [National Frog Day](https://www.nationalday.com/days/world-frog-day/). Unfortunately, March the 20th is on Saturday this year, so what about the Friday before? Quad witching day. With GME's earnings the next week. Besides all of this pointing to something happening, there has been MAJOR call flow in the [millions](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1364987782133874695) detected for March 19th, and April 19th. 

Last thing I'll end with that no one else talks about: Wallstreetbets NEVER moved the stock. We had been pumping GME towards the end of last year, and half the retards lost money on their ER, the stock tanked the stock to $13 and everyone called us pumps and dumps and retards. Once we got media coverage on CNBC in Jan with Ryan moving Chewy directors onto the board, that's when the stock started moving. This is a billionaire's battle, Hedge funds fucking with hedge funds, and I have a feeling Ryan Cohen has something up his sleeve coming soon. This is a second chance for anyone who missed the boat the first round and had massive regret. As long as there isn't blatant Market Manipulation like last time, the squeeze has yet to be squoze.

Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech &amp; fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service &amp; shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration. Also I really like the stock.

96,lw9q78,"As we all know, Ryan Cohen ***loves*** tweeting cryptically. Recently he posted a picture of a Mcdonald's Ice Cream cone and a Frog emoji 🐸 and GME's price doubled. I'm not seeing many people talk about what his tweet actually means. [Link to RC's Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289)

Mcdonald's ran a promotion and served 25 cent ice cream cones for ""International Happiness Day"" which falls on [March 20th](https://twitter.com/MusicalxFelony/status/1365913653862682627/photo/1).

The picture of the ice cream cone is taken from a [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-near-you-with-working-ice-cream-machine-mcbroken-website-2020-10?r=MX&amp;IR=T). TLDR: Someone made a website of broken McDonald's ice cream machine locations, and the website ***crashed*** because it had so much attention. Could also infer that GME is not broken/going bankrupt, hence the Ice cream, and the soft serve ice cream ""squeezing"" out of the machine.

What about the Frog though? Well, March 20th is [National Frog Day](https://www.nationalday.com/days/world-frog-day/). Unfortunately, March the 20th is on Saturday this year, so what about the Friday before? Quad witching day. With GME's earnings the next week. Besides all of this pointing to something happening, there has been MAJOR call flow in the [millions](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1364987782133874695) detected for March 19th, and April 19th.

Last thing I'll end with that no one else talks about: Wallstreetbets NEVER moved the stock. We had been spamming about GME towards the end of last year, and half the retards lost money on their ER, the stock tanked the stock to $13 and everyone called us retards. Once we got media coverage on CNBC in Jan with Ryan moving Chewy directors onto the board, that's when the stock started moving. This is a billionaire's battle, Hedge funds fucking with hedge funds, and I have a feeling Ryan Cohen has something up his sleeve coming soon. This is a second chance for anyone who missed the boat the first round and had massive regret. As long as there isn't blatant Market Manipulation like last time, the squeeze has yet to be squoze.
