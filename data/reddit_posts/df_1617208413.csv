Citadel filed an application on December 18, 2020 for an exemption from ""all provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, except section 9 and sections 36 through 53 and the rules and regulations under those sections.""  The link to that filing can be found on the Federal Register here:  [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/28/2020-28492/citadel-enterprise-americas-llc-formerly-citadel-llc-and-ceif-llc-notice-of-application](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/28/2020-28492/citadel-enterprise-americas-llc-formerly-citadel-llc-and-ceif-llc-notice-of-application)

  
I have some work obligations today so I do not have time to break this down in great detail - but here are the highlights.  


The Investment Security Act of 1940 is summarized in Investopedia as follows:  


""What Is the Investment Company Act of 1940?

The Investment Company Act of 1940 is an act of Congress which regulates the organization of investment companies and the activities they engage in, and sets standards for the investment company industry. The legislation in the Investment Company Act of 1940 is enforced and regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp). This legislation defines the responsibilities and requirements of investment companies and the requirements for any publicly-traded investment product offerings, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and unit investment trusts. The Act primarily targets publicly-traded retail investment products.""  


The link to the full act can be found here:  [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1879/pdf/COMPS-1879.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1879/pdf/COMPS-1879.pdf)

There are a bunch of other acts out there from which stems a litany of regulatory and case law - but as far as black letter statutory law - this statute is the grandfather and ultimate authority for much of our modern investment entity regulation (i.e. it supersedes case law and regulatory law that directly stems from/takes its authority from the black letter law).  While there are other statutes the govern the industry - granting an exemption from any of this black letter law is a big deal (from which stem other regulations and case law).  


So what specifically have they been exempted from?  

&amp;#x200B;

According to the SEC order on January 13, 2021 (linked above) the December 18, 2021 (also linked above - apparently they filed on December 13 - but for some reason the published date is December 18 - they probably amended after the initial filing) - they have been exempted from:  


""Citadel Enterprise Americas LLC and CEIF LLC filed an application on December 13, 2019, and amended on May 7, 2020, July 10, 2020, and October 15, 2020, requesting a superseding order that amends and restates a prior order under sections 6(b) and 6(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (‚ÄúAct‚Äù) granting an exemption from all provisions of the Act, except section 9, and sections 36 through 53, and the rules and regulations thereunder. With respect to sections 17 and 30 of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and rule 38a-1 under the Act, the exemption is limited as set forth in the application.""

&amp;#x200B;

A plain reading of Citadel's application reveals that their petition was granted in full ""limited as set forth in the application.""  I don't have time to do a deep dive on the limitations or each section they have been exempted from - but lets hit the highlights:  


1. THEY HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE ACT
2. THEY ARE EXEMPTED FROM SECTION 34 (page 89 in the pdf linked above) WHICH PROHIBITS THE DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS  


TL;DR  Citadel has been granted an exemption by the SEC from the majority of the black letter law in one of the biggest statutes that governs their operations effective January 13, 2021.  THIS INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FROM RULES AGAINST THE DESCTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS.    


My take:  This should give us the opposite of FUD.  This should give us ACD - Anger, Confidence, and Diamond Hands.

52,mhak6j,"After seeing the $30 Billion selloff spree from this past week it provides an enormous opportunity to take advantage of $VIAC. I think what many may be falling to see is the fundamentals of this stock have not changed. Yes, the technicals changed on the chart; however, that is not the real story in my opinion. There is real value here with the enormous Media Networks under this company.

NOW let me speculate for a minute. As the environment continues to transform digitally I can only think of unlimited revenue streams by $VIAC is the gaming and streaming space; especially now.

Perhaps this is the opportunity for gaming industry companies to identify the strategic landscape just as Major League Gaming did in April 2012 with CBS Interactives partnership alongside of Twitch.

\*\* CBS Interactive was dissolved after an organizational restructuring and renamed ViacomCBS Streaming in order to accelerate ViacomCBS 'direct-to-consumer streaming strategies.

\*\*  ViacomCBS Streaming renamed CBS All Access to [Paramount+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B), with additional streaming content and rebranding 

Okay, so let's look at the brass tax.

$DISCB traded up 70% to $119.35, possibly a large insider trade or heavy buying from an activist investor. Nonetheless, discounting the control premium that B shares provide and A shares don't, let's just say 30%, it implies that whoever is buying the shares would have probably valued normal $DISCA shares at at least $83.

Rand  is a small BDC/SBIC/RIC in Buffalo, NY, and they were recently ‚Äúacquired‚Äù by Terry Pegula (aka big Terry, who owns the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills, but also is a billionaire fracker who apparently ruined Pennsylvania‚Äôs tap water until 2050).

RANDs largest holding is ACV Auctions, which you may or may not know went public last week and now is at 30ish/share.  Rand‚Äôs 2020 10-K valued their stake at 6M, but based on today‚Äôs prices it is now around 30M.  Press release states they still owned 590,580 shares as of IPO, which means they sneakily made 15ish million.

For a 49M market cap company, the ACV ipo just increased their market cap by 50% if based on assets.

82,mhatnf,"ASLAN Pharmaceuticals limited, based in Singapore

Healthcare/ Biotech

**Short interest 60%+  &lt;insert rocket emoji here&gt;**

Aslan Pharmaceuticals has 3 major projects in their pipeline:

1)ASLAN004 - monoclonal therapy for asthma and contact dermatitis

2)ASLAN003 - selective immune response inhibitor for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis  

3) AhR antagonists, seems to be a druggable system that could be used to improve our own latent immune responses to tumors, etc.

Partners include Almirall, Array BioPharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and CSL Limited.

This company appears to be burning cash like a motherfucker, taking out loans and fabricating stocks to keep them afloat.

Did I mention 60%+ short interest ? maybe that's why...

Also, a **super low float at 1.75M** with 38M outstanding.

Something seems off, but I am no expert nor even am I an-mature.

If 60% of the float is shorted, what would happen to the shorts if someone with a few millions bought up the low float?

Fundamentals aside, I was also just curious about seeing such a high short interest after all of this GME etc stuff, wanted to know what you all thought.",ASLN ASLAN Pharm. Highest Short Interest? let's discuss...,1.0,1617210812,JabJabRight
