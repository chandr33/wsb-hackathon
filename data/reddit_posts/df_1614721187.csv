12,lwd9n6,"We all know the opioid crisis happened and there were several players that made it worse one of those players was TEVA. Throughout 2018 and 2019 they were facing lawsuits left and right for their role they played in the crisis. Rightfully so, they lost about 90% of their value from $60ish (60bil market cap) to the lowest around ($6) (6bil market cap). 

Now all that aside it looks like all of the lawsuits have since come and gone and now they are back at it. Their revenue has declined slightly for the past two years because one of their money makers now has generic counterparts, but with the amount of other drugs they make and are currently researching it makes 0 sense why they are so cheap, EXCEPT obviously it left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth.

Warren buffet has owned about 500mil of Teva for sometime, or about 4% of the company. He doesn’t invest in things unless he sees the value of the company.

I currently hold a few hundred shares and some calls for June, Jan 22 and Jan 23. 

I am LONG Teva, and no clue how high this stock can go, but based on its current valuation and comparing with other pharma companies 25-30$ would be a fair valuation.

If you’re interested in seeing what I’m talking about, look it up!

Who is eating their overpriced faux meat in a recession anyway?

* Unilever aka one of the largest consumer brands on the planet, which I think is a large place, is making its own. Impossible burger is also going to SPAC or go public.
* Impossible Foods cuts wholesale prices by 15% for the second time in one year. Translation: LOL Fake pink slime is competing on price pressure from another fake pink slime...Imagine when Unilever who has more capacity and scale than these two hacks comes in (think Costco Hot Dog for 1.50 plus a glorious fountain drink).

Impossible meat (aka the #1 competitor) just cut prices ([LINK](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/impossible-foods-to-cut-wholesale-prices-here-by-double-digits)). They are still rumored to go SPAC/public in 21 which will give them a ton of additional capital to take on Beyond Pink Slime. Do I care that Kaiser Cafeteria buys them? By the time they switch to impossible or another cheaper option, the stock will be below $100. Also saw Jim Chanos dunk on it today ([LINK](https://twitter.com/WallStCynic/status/1349021575258001424?s=20)). Remember when meat was sold out and the only thing left was fake meat?
