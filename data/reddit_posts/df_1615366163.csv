He shorted Tesla in 2019 and look where it is. 
He shorted GSX at 31 dollars in May.. its near 90 now. 
He shorted YY in November at 68 and its at 120 now.

Now the little scummy born with a silverspoon law school dropout had been chasing XL Fleet ticker XL. 

Him and his horde of corrupt lawyers are dying to tear XL down with lies and insinuations despite XL having sent 2 rebuttals to their falsery. 

This morning at 8:45 am ET he will be on squawkbox cnbc trying to push more lies on a few other stocks to short them including XL.  

XL fleet is a solid company founded 10'years ago by 2 MIT grads who are not jerkoffs like
Carson so theyre not reeming his ass like others would have. 

Anyone that does a little DD into XL will see its a solid company with 0 debt and lots in their coffers with exponential growth happening every week. 

Left alone Im sure XL will be fine butttttt We should send this piece of trash Carson to the cleaners sooner rather than later.  I believe its time we ride XLs back to the moon to bankrupt the shit out of Carson Cock Block!!!",BANKRUPT MUDDY WATERS!!!!,1.0,1615366282,adammechwarrior

I love this stock. I wish I'd bought more before, and as the price rises, I'm torn about how much more to YOLO. And something occurs to me...

No one knows how this is going to play out. We know the price must rise, but no one knows how much by. No one knows when. No one knows for how long. No one knows how much ammo the HFs have, or what the hidden rules are. No one knows the shape of the journey ahead.

Here's one thing we do know: THEY WILL CHEAT. They will use every trick in the book, then they will invent new ones. We can laugh as they dig a deeper pit with shorts and buy more dips, but even a smooth-brained crayon-eating yadda yadda something something retard should expect they they still have new tricks that we haven't seen yet.

I sense a trap.

The market mechanisms are on our side for once. If we buy *what we can afford to lose* and HOLD HOLD HOLD, either we will win or the entire market system still disintegrate. I LIKE THOSE ODDS! But this strategy depends on the HOLD HOLD HOLD part.

Fellow apes: if you can't afford to hold what you buy, DON'T buy more!

If you remortgage your house, YOLO the college fund, and get leverage up to the tits, there is a chance that the HFs will find a way to artificially (and presumably illegally) crash the price, and through whatever arcane black magic find a way to keep it low as your mortgage payments keep coming in.

STAY LIQUID, apes!

Make sure you can pay the bills!

Spend *whatever you can afford to lose* on GME, but figure out *how much that is*, and for the sake of discipline set yourself a target price to STOP buying at. Maybe stop buying at $1k, or $2k or $10k or whatever, figure out your own number IN ADVANCE and STICK TO IT.

Gambling is an addiction, and even if you win, addiction can shatter families. If you buy at $5k and the HFs manage to drag the price down to £100 for six months, you're going to have to look at your wife and her boyfriend through the kitchen window every morning, knowing that the price will spike again but still having to sleep on the lawn.

DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE TO SELL.

SET A TARGET TO STOP BUYING.

GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BEFORE THAT POINT.
