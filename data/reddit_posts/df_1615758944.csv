53,m55mvf,"TL;DR the new DTCC rules for short sellers almost certainly aren't going into effect before March 19th--INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO SUBMIT A COMMENT ARE INCLUDED AT THE END.

I'm not a securities lawyer or SEC savant or even a particularly wrinkle-brained ape but I've read the DTCC proposed rules on liquidity requirements and short sellers and some affiliated communications and I think some WSB record-straightening is needed. 

First, a public comment period is almost always required for any federal rules changes. SEC or its affiliates may be exempt from this for some reason and I can't tell from the materials themselves so hopefully a smarter ape than me can offer comment. 

Until I hear otherwise, I'm going to assume that this is like every other federal rulemaking and the comment period is PUBLIC and will last 30 days minimum. I'm including directions for how to submit comments at the end pasted directly from DTCC's [IMPORTANT NOTICE](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf) on the proposed rule changes. If you have a strong opinion about these rules, the public comment period would be the time to voice it. 

**What's the actual timeline for the new rules?**

IMO the more important of the two rules (801) lists an implementation timeframe that can be found on page 19 of 79 of [the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf):

&gt;*(v)  Implementation Timeframe*   
&gt;  
&gt;*NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice and approval of the related proposed rule change by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website*

NOTE: the ""related proposed rule"" is [SR-NSCC-2021-002](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf) and AFAIK has not been approved either.

I believe this passage is the source of the ""10 days"" timeline I have seen elsewhere. However, by my read this is saying two conditions must be met **before** the 10 business day countdown can  begin: (1) a ""no objection"" is filed associated with this rule AND (2) **SR-NSCC-2021-002** is also approved. 

Once both happen, that essentially gives everybody two weeks to prepare, make changes, etc. But before we start marking any close dates on the calendar, ask yourself: do I really think there will be \*no\* objection to this? 

To be clear, ""no objection"" is a term of art. Once again, I'm not a lawyer or SEC expert but I assume objections can come from the leaders at SEC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and presumably other federal political leaders including House and Senate financial services committees. The list of people who could object might also include, though I hope not, industry lobbyists or trade association heads. I don't know. Again, if you know this, please comment and I'll update.

**Why does this matter?**

I'm not a big fan of fixating on specific dates for things like short squeezes. The market is huge and complex and there are literally millions of people doing their part to influence it in lots of different ways. But if you've got dates in mind, and they're coming up soon, IMO you are safer and probably better off assuming this DTCC rulemaking process will not be complete and the new rules will not be in effect.

**How do I submit a comment?**

The DTCC Important Notice directs comments to SEC's Internet comment form here: [*http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml*](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)*.* When you click through though you'll see that's not actually a form but a list of SEC affiliated organizations. Ordinarily I would expect to find the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) proposed rules on the [NSCC proposed rule page](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm) but neither of these is listed there. So you may need to skip the SEC Internet comment form and go straight to ***sending an email to rule-comments@sec.gov.***

Here are the instructions for submitting a comment from DTCC's letter on [SR-NSCC-2021-002 &amp; SR-NSCC-2021-801](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf):

FINV and YRD. 

I was talking about FINV 2-3 months ago and had major profits this past Thursday but I didn't sell because were going back at it next week. Now im spreading the news about YRD. 

YRD is the next big play IMO. Do your dd and you will find that they have struggled for about three years. You'll also see the same company has a  brother ticker currently $94 per share. In 2018 YRD was $53 per share. Currently, YRD sits at $5.16 per share with a positive upswing and very low volume. Earnings report is in 9 days from the date of this post. We gotta pump that volume up fam! 

Everyone needs to DD and spread the word on YRD. The recent positive upswing is great. They have 30+ thousand employees. They are FinTech (same as Finv and Qfin) and earnings in 9 days. THIS IS A WINNER , as long as they beat earning which i think they will. Finv already had great earnings, Qfin has ER on this Tuesday and expected to kill it. I believe YRD will follow suite. JOIN ME. TELL YOUR FRIENDS. GET THEM TENDIES!
