91,lwn6cr,"I've bought the falling knife. I enjoy high risk. Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)

Let's get to the meaty part first. 

Lesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.

Who cares about Last year? You've heard this right?

""**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**""

A. Grew membership by 36.3%

B. Increased revenue by 45.6%

C. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue

This means absolutely nothing. Again. **""Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.""**

**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts &amp; fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**

A.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  üëà  (Try search engine)

***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***

B. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% üëà  (Try search engine)

***More revenues from the budget.***

C. Medicare for all. üëà  (Try search engine)

***""Medicare for all"" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***

D.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.

***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***

E,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.

***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.

Aside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.",Clov Fundamentally sound outlook. Why Clover Health is retarded.,0.92,1614752937,AdvancedLong
