7,m42rpj,"FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Embracer Group (former THQ Nordic AB) is noted on the Swedish First North exchange which is not as regulated as ""normal"" exhanges are. There is also not the same ruleset for tax in most countries so be aware of this. It is also said to be more risky investments.

They operate in the game development and publishing business and I don't really need to dive into the prospect of this sector.

Embracer Group ([EMBRAC-B.ST](https://EMBRAC-B.ST)) is the parent company of several development and publishing business within the gaming industry and throughout most platforms including mobile, console and PC.

To name a couple of well known items in their IP inventory:

* Valheim (if you don't know yet this is going to be a catalyst)
* Saints Row
* Goat Simulator

&amp;#x200B;

**The company**

They operate THQ Nordic, Koch Media, Cofee Stain, Amplifier, Saber and Deca as operative groups.

They hold 220+ IP's, 59 development studios, the 6 above operative groups with 5500+ people in 40+ countries.

*Strategic plans*

Grabbing from the 2019/2020 annual report page 6 highlights:

* Investment for long-term growth
* Growth through M&amp;A
* Empowerment through decentralization (reference to several dev. and pub. branches)
* Reinvesting profit to increase growth

&amp;#x200B;

*Let's see what they've done about it* with referencing their press releases ([https://embracer.com/news-media/](https://embracer.com/news-media/)):

* 2021-02-03: Merge with Easybrain (Mobile games as Sudoku and so on)
* 2021-02-03: Acquires Aspyr Media (Star Wars, Sid Meier's Civilization etc.)
* 2021-02-03: Merge with Gearbox Entertainment Company (Borderlands)
* 2020-11-18: Acquires Flying Wild Hog (Shadow Warrior series)

...

Seems like they took M&amp;A serious.. If you're interested, theres a presentation of the M&amp;A actions here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update\_Feb\_3\_2021-ny.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update_Feb_3_2021-ny.pdf)

We can't go about without mentioning Valheim. The viking survival game that is currently running early access on Steam and had over 4 million buys came February. The game has taken the industry with storm. As of writing there's 18k viewers on twitch which is close to Overwatch and Hearthstone.

It was release the 2nd of February through Steam with a 96% positive feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials (*****sort of*****)**

First looking at the gaming market which has been reported from 2018 to 139 billion USD to 2019 ranging in 152 billions. Estimates for 2022 is close to 200 billion.

Second, insider holdings. The insiders account for 52.7% of the shares with 35.5% being on institutional hands. The remainder for trade is 11.8%.

The Q4 report arrrives the 20th of May.

The report is a bit difficult for my smooth brain to compare since the previous year is for 15 months so bear with me.

Net sales grew from \~4603m SEK to \~5249m SEK.

Operational EBIT grew from \~717m SEK to \~1033m SEK.

I'm not yet that experiences in reading the financial reports so I won't bore you with my mistakes. It can be found here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf)

From my limited knowledge I see increases on almost all areas worth noting which is also impressive considering that the previous period is a 15 month period (I don't know why).

73,m43rnc,"I\`ve spent the last months in this forum and in watching the candlesticks playing rollercoaster with my heart. I felt sick, I was nervous and all the other shit. I'm sharing my thoughts. 

Then I started to read WSB and other subs. I read great DD\`s and I read bad DD´s, I read hype, FUD and everything in-between. My emotions got involved. I felt fear, anger, disappointment. All the feelings that shouldn't be involved in trading. Especially in a once in a Lifetime situation we have with GME.  
I know it\`s hard. We put some hard earned money into the stock. Some of us want revenge for 2008. I'm from germany and wasn't affected by 2008, so I can't imagine what this means to some of you. But what I can connect to is what it feels like to put the hard earned money into a stock I've only heard about a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

This means, I'm relying on other smart people. People who where involved since 2020 and earlier. People who understand the market, the analysis and every other shit a normal ape is struggling with. This people have done some amazing shit. Shit hedgies wish they could do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our smart apes are delivering information. Information and their own opinion. Thats it. Their opinion is biased by their values and knowledge. They are trying to help us in the best way they can. They are doing the things we don't want or can't do, because most of us are stupid or just lazy apes.  Some of us even don't read the links they put in. But we should. We must. 

❤️ THX to all you smart and supportive apes.

&amp;#x200B;

I will explain why in a second.

&amp;#x200B;

u/rensole and u/HeyItsPixeL are amazing people, just to name a few. There are many many other smart brains in this sub (But rensole and Pixel seem to be the most mentioned). They compress information based on the accessable data out there. They are explaining charts and are making guesses based on their informations. And honestly: they are very good. But you need to understand that their information is available for everyone. For us, Hedgies, CNBC for everyone. Some information may also be new to the hedgies, but I really think, the hedgies already know what is infront of them. Why, you may ask: 

  
**Well, that's easy.** They don't just have to deal with retail investors but also with their biggest competitors. The Melvins and Citadels must know what dates are important dates. They must know what strategies are used to destroy them, etc. This right now is a battlefield. And Melvin and Citadel have to fight on 2 or more fronts. They got attacked from the right (apes) and from the left (big player hedge funds). So what do you do when you are Melvin?  


1. You know that your big competitors know all your dirty tricks. They use the same technology. The same data. Have 100 analysts sitting and just calculating strategies in real time. Have billions of dollars. They are on the same level as you are. They also have the same connections, play golf with DTCC, share wifes, pay for their wifes boyfriends and so on.   
So Melvin knows that they can't shake them off easy, because their competitors know every dirty trick. For them this is an opportunity to destroy Melvin and Co. When they lose billions of dollars in trying so, they will just say, we had the opportunity to become the biggest players in this game, we had to try to destroy them. No one of them is emotionally connected to the money. Why?, because its not their hard earned money. Its their investors money. No emotional connection. Its just a tool. So what do you do when you are Melvin and know you can't shake this mf off?
2. Well you shake off the attacking right side. The people who are emotionally connected to their money. The people who want revenge. The people who are desperately waiting for the squeeze to happen. The people who need confirmation twice a day. The people who want to hear that the squeeze is going to happen on date ""X"" at Time ""Y"" and will last for Hours ""Z"" and the exit point is ""B"" or ""C"". You attack THEM!

How? Easy. You kick the can down the street for as long as you possibly can. That Pixel posted a date doesn't matter at all. Everybody knew about this date or any other future date. This information is new to us apes. Not for them. But what they can do is playing a dirty game. Using every strategy available. Using data only Hedgies can access. Bending rules we apes even don't know have existed and could be bent. The hedgies do all of this. We on the other side can only deal with what is visible for us. Data we can access. We are not involved in their daily meetings or golf sessions with the DTCC. We don't know what game they play. We don't know how they play it. But we for sure know what the outcome will be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Take a loo at DFV**. Did he ever mention a date? Not that I know. Why? I think that he knows how dirty this game is gonna be played. I think he knows that there is no predictable date whatsoever. The only thing he knows is, that it is going to moon. **Thats it.** 

So what rensole and Pixel are doing is not wrong. Its correct, based on the information they have available and their limited (in a positive way) knowledge about the strategies the hedgies can drive. They are helping us to understand how this would play out if everything was easy, smooth and fair. This game is not fair at all. Melvin is able to make an unpredictable amount of moves. Its like playing CS or CoD against a cheater who can look through walls and knows when you are coming even before you know that he is hiding behind the next wall.

Every time some apes or the FUD are posting ""gamma"" ""today moon"" etc. its building up some expectations. Expectations that are going to be unfulfilled. And when they become unfulfilled more than once you begin to doubt the whole thing. And why? Because you are emotionally connected to this situation. 

I know we apes don't want to loose our money. But we will unless we stop demotivating us. Thats the only way they can shake us off. Thats the only way they can make us sell before the peak. (no one knows where this peak will be). So you damn apes listen carefully:

THERE IS NO EXACT DATE FOR MOONING OR SQUEEZE. NO DATE AT ALL!! 

THE ONLY THING THAT WE KNOW IS THE FACT THAT IT WILL HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.

LISTEN TO DFV POSTS: THERE ARE NO DATES IN HIS POSTS! HE IS JUST SHARING THE INEVITABLE FACT. 

Use the information shared by our smart apes to understand how the markets work. And if things go a different way understand that there are cheats and strategies we don't know about unless we start working at the shithouse Melvin or Citadel.

READ THE DD\`s. READ THE THEORY. UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A GAME WE ONLY CAN INFLUENCE IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND THAT WHEN WE GET DISCOURAGED.

Stay brave my APES. I bought in at peak in January and I'm holding since. I bought more in the last days, because I believe that this shit will blow up in the future. I don't know what is going to happen or when, but for sure I know that this thing is making history right now. 

The only thing that can reduce our gains is us getting afraid because our expectations are unfulfilled. Stop that. Let the game play out. Watch how the big guys fight each other and take the tendies. The big sharks are here for blood now. They want to become the new ALPHAS. And we are growing with them. We don't have to calculate anything. Trust the process and when things fall in place decide for yourself. 

No one can tell you the exact peak or exit point. Do your research. Learn how to recognize opportunities. Don't trust anyone who is talking about anything happen on an exact date, because no one knows. Even when its happening people will still be wondering if its the final squeeze or the beginning. So open up your brains for information. Read rensoles and Pixels posts. Read the links in their posts and chill the fuck out. Take your stimulus check and get some amazing food. Be wise.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have no idea of ​​financial affairs, I am simply a retard who follows other retards. I currently own GME and AMC shares, and I try to read all about these two stocks.

 The question I ask myself is simple, could it be that AMC is being a distraction for GME? I see this week is having a lot of AMC hype and I think that buying volume could put more pressure on the shorts and speed up the process at GME. 

Is it really a path chosen by us or is it a trap path imposed by the HF?

81,m43vkq,"Okay, here's some back-of-the-napkin math for the  rough effect of the upcoming stimulus cheques on GME volume and liquidity.

Please feel free to add relevant info and correct me where I'm wrong. Let's try to crowdsource this bitch.

According to [this](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-19-trillion-house-covid-relief-bill) the direct cost of the stimmyboy is **$422 billion**.

According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html)  (forgive me, take this with a mountain of salt) a survey of **430** investors who use online broker platforms will spend this percentage of their stimmy on equities:

* respondents between **25 and 34 years old** plan to spend **50%** of their stimulus payments on stocks.
* Meanwhile, **18- to 24-year-old** retail investors involved in the survey planned to use **40%** of any stimulus checks on stocks.
* And **35- to 54-year-old retail investors** surveyed planned to use 37% of their checks on stock market investment.

Assuming the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) holds. We can assume that this is a representative sample of the US public.

According to [InfoPlease.com](https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics), the percentage of the population in the US in these age brackets are the following:

under-17-year-olds will receive no stimmy

18–24-year-olds are 13.27% of the population

25-34-year-olds are 14.2% of the population

35-54-year-olds are 29.2% of the population

55-plus-year-olds are 21% of the population

Since under 17s don't get a stimmy we need to adjust so the percentages reach a hundo.

18–24-year-olds are 17.08% of the stimmy receivers

25-34-year-olds are 18.28% of the stimmy receivers

35-54-year-olds are 37.59% of the stimmy receivers

55-plus-year-olds are 27.03% of the stimmy receivers

Let's assume no one over 55 invests any of their stimmy into the market.

According to [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/08/31/most-americans-dont-have-a-real-stake-in-the-stock-market/) 55% of Americans are in the markets.

Now we can calculate the amount going into the markets:

So: 422,000,000,000 \* percentage of stimmy receivers \* percentage of those in the market \* percentage YOLO'd

=  422,000,000,000 \* 0.16

= **67,520,000,000** or a **$67.5 Billion injection**

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can make some rough guesses on what percentage of that will go into **$GME**, **$CUM** and **$ANUS**.  


At **2%**  **YOLO** into **$GME**, we get a **$1,260,948,660 injection, or 4,767,291 shares!!!!!**  


Close to **5 million shares at** **2%**. **LOL**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**TL;DR:** 💎🙌🏻 - stimmy bringing the tendieman closer.

88,m43z1z,"So I haven't really logged into Reddit for some time. It's completely blown up wow. Thanks so much for the awards. I've received several messages asking me what's in my book now, so I'm gonna write a quick update.

Alright, so **I've already gotten out of ViacomCBS** \- did so **at $70** actually. Happy to outline my rationale in full next time but I'm relatively busy today so I'm just gonna update y'all on my positions (and a TLDR on why I'm invested in some of them). Let me know what your thoughts are - would love to have a discussion around this. So, I've **recently rotated into the following stocks. Interesting positions in bold.** 

**Swing Trades (6 Month Plays)**

* **Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT; -13%)**: Sarepta is **massively undervalued**. **Only player right now in the DMD space**. Additional **FDA approvals** suggest that the FDA is still keen on SRPT's treatments (there was a little controversy in the past). Trade carefully though, this stock can get volatile. I believe that I got in a little too early, but my personal **PT for SRPT is 120**.
* **Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG; +22%)**: 3 main reasons why GNOG is a strong buy. Firstly, it is a **severely undervalued** stock. Warrants have also mostly expired / been exercised. Secondly, **online gambling is getting legalized** across the US. Thirdly, the **brand recognition** in the US is pretty high. If Draft Kings is the global player for millennials, **GNOG is the US player for boomers**. Would love to write an in-depth analysis on GNOG when I have time. 
* **General Dynamics (GD; +12%)**: **Space baby, space**. Increased government contracts + retail interest = Boom.
* Helca Mining (HL; +6%): Super volatile trade. Indirect hedge against inflation. 
* Lockheed Martin (LMT; +1%): Severely undervalued IMO. Also, Space. 

**Buy and Hold (Long Term Plays)**

* Ozon Holdings (OZON; +19%): Amazon of Russia. Highly volatile though, so I'd recommend caution on when and at what price you enter this trade. 
* Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB; +14%): Great management team + execution = Likely successful in transition into clean energy. 
* British Petroleum (BP; +4%): Fastest transition by a major oil player into clean energy. 2nd time's the charm, I believe. 
* Dollar General (DGBP; -3%): The underlying economy is actually quite week IMO. There's likely to have been quite a bit of capital scrapping over the past year. Unemployment has fallen and people are getting vaccinated. But there is a non-zero risk of another potential wave (SA Variant) which may result in an increase in U3. U6 unemployment is also likely to be above typical averages after COVID as employers realize many of their employees can plausibly be streamlined. 

Happy to do another in depth analysis on any of the above positions as my previous post got quite a bit of traction (thanks for the interest!). Let me know if you're keen on any of them and I'll pen my thoughts accordingly.","Out of VIAC. Now in GNOG, SRPT, and GD.",1.0,1615632412,Bulky-Mountain8854

If I want to close the covered call before expiration I would have to buy the call and the only thing that I will lose is the premium difference right? So let's say the calls are now worth being above my strike, price at 0.40$ and I want to close before expiration which means that I will be losing my premium and also the 0.08$ additional right ?
