**DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.** Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. 

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. **All trading strategies are used at your own risk.**","RKT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 115M Share float, 121M Share Institutional Ownership, 5.8M Insider Ownership, BILLION $$$$ BUYBACK AND MORE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",1.0,1615295063,YoLO-Mage-007

There are A LOT of shills and bots, even if the account was created before January. Yes, some people are getting paid to enroll you to post negative comments/posts.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. GME is the only play

It’s a one in a lifetime event. Everything else is a distraction : S.LV, U.WMC, R.KT (obvious p\*mp and d\*mp). Any ticker that is not GME is not the play. This will never happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Your shares matter

Every share is important. Even fractional ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Never day-trade GME

Daytrading impacts the squeeze negatively. Selling to “buy more on the dip” helps hedge funds. Hold onto your shares.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Hold GME

Supply and demand : you have something they want, so you get to set the price. Btw, hey hid their shorts in ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. GME can get to $500k/share

I’m not saying that it will, but it can. Will your hands be made of paper? And if you ask yourself this obvious question : yes, there is enough money, and no, it will not crash the entire market. Yes, they do have $35 trillion to spare for the greatest transfer of wealth in history. This is what makes the GME saga unique.

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. This is not a game of greed, it is a game of trust

No prisoner’s dilemma here.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. The squeeze will last for days, and it didn't happen yet.

Don’t be afraid to miss it. The squeeze has not been squoze.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. There will be dips

Be strong, you set your price.

&amp;#x200B;

# 10. Be smart about your money

Leave some for taxes, give back to the community, and reinvest in GameStop.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

This isn't financial advice in any shape or form but merely my opinion. I just like the stock and I will not sell under 500k/share. You need to do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, just a retarded ape. Not financial advice, only my thoughts.

I bought my first share of GME on January 29th for $319.18. It went up maybe 5 dollars after that, and then it all crashed. I bought a few more shares as it went down, but I was honestly wondering if I’d made a huge mistake and just wasted my money on a dumb meme. I got my average cost down to $181.14, and I was planning on getting a few more shares later since I didn’t think it would be moving from the $40s any time soon. 

I was wrong, and I was honestly shocked to see the price quadruple in the past two weeks. It was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I haven’t made the hundreds of thousands of dollars that some people on here have, and I still don’t think GME will get me anywhere near that much. But for someone who has never made more than $10 an hour, any free money is more than welcome.
