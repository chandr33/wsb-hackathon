The situation smells familiar right? January we had a very very similar situation where gme couldn't be bought anymore and at the same time the HF massively short GME and AMC and other companies like BB and NOK.

Today they did the exact same trick. They made a great move by shorting a the same height than two months ago because they knew there were going people (paperhand weeper) to sell at 300 or 330$ and thus shorting here would trigger some stop loss as bonuses. Plus they prepared some articles for the media to be published only like 20-30 minutes after! How the fuck did they write the article that fast? They did not, they prepared beforehand.

But you know what is different from last time? Last time we diped until it reached 40$, this time only 198$! and it went up to 268$ again as I'm writing this! It means the owners held strong those shares!

That's why the gme stock is going up anyway because that is the only diamonded way possible. I don't know by the way where I was supposed to convince you, I told ya I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore!

5 shares.
