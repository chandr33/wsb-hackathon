4,m66ndb,"Just watched the documentary on ABC and here’s what makes me like this stock even more. 

No investigative journalism, just a bunch of interviews with paper handed bitches (one guy sold on Jan 28th for a 30% loss), lawyers and HF guys, plus portney and Cuban. 

Why not post the stock positions of Jim Cramer, Mark Cuban or anyone else except the guys with only $5k in it?

Why no investigation into the connections between Melvin Capital, Citadel, and Robinhood? Or how Robinhood even makes its money if everything is free 99?

They briefly mention the stock being heavily shorted as a problem and bring on a 9 year old kid to explain shorting with an Xbox analogy 🙄 what they don’t mention is these guys were trying to borrow their friend’s xbox, play it until it was worthless, then keep it and buy a new one for themselves. 

They spent a lot of time and money on this production to convince the masses that this is over. It was a fun rollercoaster and Congress got involved so things will get more fair but definitely Gamestop is a dead cat.

36,m66v98,"Fellow Apes, understanding strategy is what I’m best at and I want you to hear this out.  

This isn’t financial advice!!! And, I’m in both AMC and GME ( actually have more $$ in AMC)

Yesterday was an unprecedented day with hedgie funds putting all their weight into the short attack on GME while simultaneously allowing AMC to creep slowly up to 14, while at the same time Jim Cramer is supporting both stocks. WHAT IS GOING ON!

Well I believe the hedgies are in serious trouble in GME- which is where we need to focus our attention to.  Cramer is trying to get his paperhanded followers into both AMC and GME so to flip shares so that they can ultimately bring these undelivered shares to current status, and not be fined significantly by the SEC. Well if your Cramers followers and you look at the charts of the 2 stocks yesterday who do you think they are going to buy, pretty fing obvious!!! Now this will be good in the short term for AMC but bad  in the long run, potentially causing us to not squeeze at all.  Craemer’s followers aren’t going to buy a stock that is over $200 and dropped over 40 points yesterday, which will keep all the share in the hands of us diamond holders.

After long consideration heres what I’m going to do. Again NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE, just a dumb ape talking out loud 

I’m going let AMC rise until the end of the week, and sell my 1700 shares at an average $8.00 per share, and buy into GME 38 share at an average $214.

Yes, only a MORON would sell the share he’s making a good return on and dump it into another share that he’s underwater.  However, I believe this is the only way to an ultimate victory.  

If GME can stay above $200 this WILL ELIMINATE THE PAPERHANDS FLIPPING SHARES!!

Why did you buy at 40? Why did you buy at 100? Why did you buy at 200? Why did you buy at 300? Why did you hold?

The is only ONE answer to those questions: for the squeeze.

Has the squeeze happened? NO.

So what's changed form the time you bought? Nothing except that the HFs have maxed out more and more credits cards... They have unleashed a torrent of shit into the hot girl's toilet bowl and the now the damn thing won't flush...

38,m66vs5,"**Coty** is the leading #1 fragrance selling company in the world and #3 in color cosmetics. The company had bad management for years. However, now Sue Nabi, arguably the best cosmetics manager, is at the helm of the company, and the Share price has tripled since then. Nevertheless, the stock has still a lot of potential left.

With brands such as Gucci, Burberry, Hugo Boss, Marc Jacobs, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner - the company will be a huge winner of the reopening.

Furthermore, the company is backed by Maye Musk, the mother of Elon. Maye Musk is a Covergirl (which belongs to COTY) model. If people realize that, this could become the new Gamestop.
