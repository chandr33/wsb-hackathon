I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.

What was interesting to me is that this recent GME rocket followed the same trading-days as the previous one. (tuesday-wednesday initial leap, peak on a Wednesday 2 weeks after initial peak.)

Essentially what I’m saying is, any hope that this current rocket is just in a “rough spot” and we just need to HODL is pretty delusional. It’s going to crash miserably probably back down to $40 again, (maybe higher this time because more people are on the bandwagon, we’ll see.) 

I will buy back into GME the moment it stabilizes at a lower cost, because events like these are likely repeatable. But right now, we’ll see it tumbling down for the next week or so.",This current GME spike has been killed. (But it’s possible it can do it again.),1.0,1615838873,Sockratis

**EBON is Undervalued**:
It also hasn't pumped nearly as much as other miners, and lots of upside growth potential. Others well know Corn stocks are at around 10X plus while this remains at around only 2X.

**EBON’s Catalysts**:

--Official launch of Ebonex, app for Corn exchange trading.  This can be downloaded now on the App store.  Coinbase’s 100B+ IPO this month will drive FOMO into other related listed exchange stocks.

--March 26 earnings. Should be strong and guidance should also be strong considering the recent growth of Corn prices.

--General strong upward trend in Corn prices.

**EBON Squeeze Sweetner**:

According to https://fintel.io/ss/us/ebon this stock is at 33% short interest and one of the top shorted stocks in the market.  It won’t produce a GME styled short squeeze but dramatic upward price movement will force these shorts to cover and add more fuel to the upward trend.

Here’s why I think $FNKO heading to the moon:

-international brand and easily recognizable 
-already established customer base
-creates new product based on pop culture, so always going to be culturally significant and will have a higher degree of demand than some no name artist creating NFTs
-sold at your local $GME
-ELON just tweeted about NFT, so all NFTs are going to go up based on general NFT market 
-FNKO all time highs are at $28. Currently stock is trading at $18.",$FNKO heading straight to the 🌕,1.0,1615839209,jalapenojacker
