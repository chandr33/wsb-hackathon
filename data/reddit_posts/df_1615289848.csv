Palantir [PLTR](https://benzinga.com/stock/pltr#NYSE) has been a name both loved and hated, bought and shorted, talked about and forgotten. The real question for investors here is, what will my returns look like one, five, or 10 years from now? 

For the past month, profit-taking and shorting were the right move. It would be easy to say, with the NASDAQ 100 8% off its highs and PLTR over 40%, that maybe this stock is broken.

In the short term, I would agree. An overflow of new money, Reddit hype, and Cathie Wood buys have resulted in a highflyer becoming a bag holders’ nightmare. Even at recent lows of $21, Palantir was still up over 100% from its direct listing at the end of September. 

That being said, I still believe Palantir is a long-term buy-and-hold.

 From controversy over how the company generates revenue to flat-out conspiracies, it is easy to get lost in the noise and forget what it is you’re even investing in with this company.  

 

With a mission to fight terrorism and protect our nation, Palantir has been adopted by the highest levels of our government and military. But the secret sauce with Palantir is not their government contracts, though they help. It is the time and energy put into creating this software on the government’s dime, while the whole time intending to become something more. 

This is where the technology that has the potential to turn Palantir into an extremely profitable tech company comes in. The platforms offered by Palantir are Gotham and Foundry, while Apollo continuously delivers the software that powers the two. 

Simply put, Foundry can take traditional data management, integration, and mining and turn it into an internal simulation to create the best possible outcome for a company’s success. Now, you’re probably thinking this sounds like something you may have seen in a sci-fi show like Westworld. In a much more realistic way, that is exactly what it is. 

The flaw in traditional data management tactics is they are targeted to individual departments of a business. When there is any single change in one department, it affects the outflows and inflows of other departments. What Foundry can do for businesses is integrate the data from all departments, as one entity, while still adjusting for any change in one single department and make the required changes to the affected departments. 

This is how the data management of Foundry can change the course of any business and help set the best possible path to success. The what-ifs of every business can be simulated in a way like never before, with actual analytics and results of an expansion that might have cost millions. Palantir essentially creates a digital twin of a business model and grows it alongside the actual business while using everything it learns to improve both.

There’s also something worth noting from the company’s last earnings report. Though Palantir was not profitable on an earnings basis, many missed that they offered $1.2 billion in stock compensation to their employees. Typically, this is something we would see with a startup. The fact that we are seeing actions like this from a company that has been around for almost 17 years is a strong indicator that they know what they have is impactful. 

With Foundry, businesses will be able to protect, innovate, and change themselves in ways never imagined, capitalizing on a market that has never been explored, with an addressable market that cannot be measured.

Investing in Palantir is investing in the visions of Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and many others involved in the journey to change the way we look at automation.""

It's extremely simple and a quick demo can be seen from the github readme as i'm not allowed to post youtube links here.

I hope this satisfies your needs.

You can download it here:

the zip contains a readme with a quick explanation.

Now i know running random code is scary so the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/karmalegend/GME_BG)

Readme:

*Super quick how to use tutorial:

Simply unzip the archive and run retardBgChanger.exe and all is done. If you are a normal human and don't want this weird folder hanging arround, right click on retardBgChanger.exe Click on create shortcut and place the shortcut wherever you like.

The window cannot be closed or the program will stop. It might give some errors at times but should always recover from these. F.e. When the scraper times out.

ABOUT:

GME_BG Hey there so this is a very simple windows 10 background changer. It might work on different Windows versions but this has not been validated.

How does it work? Most of the workings can be seen from the demo video, the only difference is that in the demo it fetches every 2 seconds and in the actual version it only does so every 20 seconds. This to prevent excessive traffic towards https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme

It changes your background to either Up.png or Down.jpg. These wallpapers can be changed to whatever as long as they confirm with Down.jpg and Up.png, or when changed within the main function.*",Background changer based on GME stock inspired by darkness96 &amp; Tumpiii,1.0,1615290918,FaZe_Henk

You see, I spend a lot of time looking at charts and figuring out if my damaged brain can comprehend certain patterns anymore.  I've noticed some epic battles taking place during the rise of the Stock, and I've been trying to document them for my own future research into the mysterious world of Wallstreet.  

So this morning I arose to the screeching of my neighbor's cock, and began my morning routine of staring at stocks and willing them to not continuing their downward progression into obscurity and my destitution.  Lo and behold, the Stock is flying like a lonely teenager to his treehouse with a new piece of erotica, and there are some interesting things happening in some of the boxes,

[We don't know who they are, but we'll call the green side Apes and the red side Hedgies for the sake of Storytime.](https://preview.redd.it/n0v3y3qmqzl61.png?width=230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a03f23123b9bf68d45c293a9768cfb366e391f)

&amp;#x200B;

I see an Ape and a Hedgie getting ready to throw down and fight.  I don't know if the Ape is one of the Apes from WSB, but they are holding the price above 220, so I like them for now.  That damn Hedgie is holding us under 221 though, so I don't like him.  I see a smaller Ape later, holding the Stock up again.

I see this as a good thing, but I didn't know there was trouble brewing.

[We see a large wall build at 235, and moments later there were large blocks sold between them that I saw while I cropped the screencap.](https://preview.redd.it/zdrd54edszl61.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcacc0a7d623b01c68d59953b60b5e2700581060)

There is a small skirmish between a Hedgie at 235 and an Ape holding at 226ish.  The Hedgie releases several blocks, bring the fight down to 218ish where an Ape saves the Stock from further plummet.  The battle is far from over, but I've decided that if I want to tell you this story I need to actually stop just taking screencaps and write it out.

If you're looking for a moral to this story, there isn't one, just that I found it interesting and there was a post yesterday that I was reminded of when I saw this trend.  I don't even know how to read, so don't expect this to have any bearing on anything ever in the entirety of creation.
