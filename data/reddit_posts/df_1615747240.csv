We all remember the scenes from Big Short how those fucks from Wallstreet were drinking champagne on the rooftop. Here is my proposal:

After we moon we should all come to Chicago and have a block party in front of Citadel's HQ which is located  in downtown Chicago. Nice little blockparty, maybe some bar hopping, park our Lambos all around  their building - $20/H Chicago parking fees won't be a problem after the squeeze. Just 1,000,000 apes wearing GME shirts and having some beers. Of course some of you are virtue signalers so we can wait for government to give you a green light and tell you that corona is gone and you can leave your parent's basements - there is no rush. I think it would be the greatest twists in those fuckers lives. Just to rub it in their faces for what they have done in 2008.

Everyday he breathes in the apocalypse

The doomed future,

Caused by his parents, their lips

Are sealed, no apology,

Just keep calm and carry on son,

&amp;#x200B;

Well, he defies this logic

The end is near,

That's written in stone

But he cannot read

So he keeps on and on

&amp;#x200B;

The journey to Mars,

because this is the way.

&amp;#x200B;

The Gamestop launch starts

To begin the great raid,

&amp;#x200B;

The sound of the barchart breakaways soars

He buys, he holds, the fellow ape nods

&amp;#x200B;

And now he became

the retarded strategy

though the tips of his fingers keep edging

To press sell,

That what says everyone who wishes

Him well

&amp;#x200B;

Noone understands though

Which is more

To listen to one's smooth brain

Or to be more

Than a passing time, than untold story

To be a millionth piece of a timechanging glory.

&amp;#x200B;

His hands, they're diamonds taking shape

He says he's not more than a simple ape

&amp;#x200B;

But who he is then, who saves his own fam,

In African forests through international funds

Who is no racist, no sexist, just bold

And naive to believe

He can be a story that's told

&amp;#x200B;

How he stuck it to those

Who, in a slow steady dose

Make the poor poorer

The money machine, the market ruler,

The Melvin analysts in ivory tower,

Fundamentalists, too drunk with their own power.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is it, the calls to arms.

The self driving cars,

LiDaRs, vaccines

LSD/weed therapies

And all other memes

&amp;#x200B;

don't count

&amp;#x200B;
