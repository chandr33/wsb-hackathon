13,m1ip16,"Well, I guess it's about that time again. I realized I haven't posted any flowery psychology bullshit in over 24 hours, and my fingies are starting to itch. So I'm back once more with what I believe to be the most likely scenario that will play out here. And once again, the key metric that will guide us through this process is that of:

PAIN MINIMIZATION

You may have read a recent post about what's called a Keynesian Beauty Contest, in which participants are rewarded for selecting what they believe would be the most popular choice overall, rather than their own personal preference. But I believe this fails to capture the whole picture, because it doesn't consider the penalty for being the most harmful, only the reward for being the most accommodating.

What we need to consider are both sides of this coin, from the perspective of all players involved. How can both sides of this trade, the market, the regulators, the government, and the unwitting public all benefit, or at the very least, not be hurt too badly by the eventual outcome when the dust settles? I took the wrong approach last time I tried to dig into this, and tried to list every possible scenario. This time, I'll give a rundown of what I believe to be the single least damaging and, by extension, most beneficial scenario.

RETAIL INVESTORS

Okay guys, you'll have to bear with me here, because I know a lot of you don't want to hear this, but most of this post will be sunshine and rainbows, so allow me to temper expectations just a bit. I think retail holds. I think they will be allowed to exit at or around the peak, somewhere within 80-85% if they're paying attention. And that SHOULD be somewhere upwards of 500k/share. But by the same token, maybe it shouldn't be. I cannot predict the effect that the price spiking to something absurd like a million per share would have. That said, I am quite certain that 100k/share would have a negligible effect, and is a good place to establish a floor with which to work off of. How long you hold past that will be up to you and your risk tolerance, but I do think you should be careful. 500k is not a meme based on the DD. Nowhere close, actually, but keep in mind that there are other players involved.

LONG INSTITUTIONS / WHALES

This one is fairly simple. There are a few ways these guys could play this, but with the exception of individual whales who are completely unpredictable (but always greedy), these bigger players will want to maximize profits for their investors while simultaneously bolstering their own image and garnering retail support. If acting in a vacuum, they would hold until whatever they calculate the ceiling to be, then be the first ones out the door. 

But this scenario is as unique psychologically as it is economically. The global retail market is watching them closely. At the moment, they are being praised for their responsible actions and holding with us while pissant hedge funds are taking all the heat. But those little hedges have caused a disproportionate amount of uncertainty compared to the assets they control. Retail is looking for any reason to maintain any faith in our market, and if a behemoth like Blackrock were to end a rightful squeeze and leave millions of bagholders out to dry, they would only deepen the hatred retail has for the market, even though that action would be entirely legal.

As another popular thread from yesterday pointed out, you will indeed be able to sell on the way down. As will they. The smartest play here is to establish a price target for themselves that would maximize profit while also allowing the market to survive largely unscathed, then slowly unwind their positions, allowing attentive retail to close their positions at attractive price points. They'd have helped facilitate the squeeze, kept their sterling reputations and even bolstered them, lined their clients' pockets, and millions of new grateful tendie-holders would be flocking to them, begging to pay them management fees. 

This would crush the small, corrupt hedges, whom they assuredly hate, restore faith in the market, consolidate market share, please their clients, earn them new ones, and grow their recurring revenue streams tremendously. 

GOVERNMENT

They're either shills, or fucking morons, but even then, the course of action here should be obvious. All eyes are on them. Plenty of regs that make them look tough on Wall St but really fuck retail can come later. But right now, the whole world is watching. As much as Melvin or Citadel might pay you, you reaaaally don't want to piss off Blackrock or Vanguard. And as much as you DGAF about your constituents, you probably don't want to piss them off either if you can help it. Plus, if you just let this happen, you actually look like you're a friend of the little guy, instead of just paying lip service to it. And you get to collect a tidy 37% tax to do what you will with. Hell, you can even use it to bail out the DTCC if you actually believe they need it. 

The alternative? Well, that's up in the air. You could try to step in. Who knows if the market would ever recover? Who knows if you've got any shot at re-election? You did just fuck your base in real-time, after all. Maybe a few million bucks from the hedge funds would sway you into action. Just gotta hope there's still an America, let alone a market, for you to spend it in.

SEC/FINRA

I get it, they want jobs at the hedge funds. Can't argue with that. Just one problem. The ones still left won't have a lot to manage if all faith in the market disappears. Maybe you talk to Blackrock and the other big longs. Maybe you let them know you can only manage up to a few hundred g's a share before you have to shut it down. They can exit slowly at that price point, and most people end up happy. DTCC will get bailed out if they really need it. You can even say you were instrumental in obtaining this bailout for them. Yeah, you gotta get tough on a few nobody hedge funds. But now you've got a seat at the table with clients at the BANK level. I'm sure you could make do with a cushy IBanking gig. 

The alternative? Again, who fucking knows. The world already hates you. Despises you to a degree rarely seen. Maybe you should be on the right side of this one for once? And again, a job in Finance isn't all that great if faith in our markets ceases to exist.

DTCC

This seems to be the one people are most concerned about. I'd argue the SEC is a bigger threat, given how patently incompetent they are. Especially with the new proposed rules, the DTCC can basically play this however they'd like. Look at the players involved: https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories. You probably recognize more than a few names. The amount of capital they have at their disposal is staggering, and there are any number of things they could do that we can't even fathom until they happen. But I posit that, at this point, allowing this to squeeze to a reasonable level is by far the most prudent option. Whether they want to try to keep it around 100k, or let it go further intentionally and angle for a bailout isn't particularly important. The only thing that would be truly unconscionable would be to make the SEC/gov step in to break one of the cardinal rules: All shorts must cover. People will fight me on this, but 2008 is fresh, and January even fresher. This would be a colossal third strike, and the implications are unimaginable.

GENERAL PUBLIC

The one no one's talking about, and the one that inevitably gets fucked the worst in most scenarios. You might think that a deep correction or mini-crash would be terrible for them. It certainly wouldn't feel great. But with retail reinvesting a large percentage of profits, their portfolios will recover, and the tale of GME will stimulate investment. They wouldn't wanna miss out on the next one (that's never coming). But if the government or SEC steps in, and the fallout is as bad as I predict it would be, those portfolios may never recover, and they'll see firsthand that normal people simply ARE NOT ALLOWED to succeed in this country.

​

TLDR: Sorry for the long-winded thread, yall. This is my opinion on how this should play out, and how it would cause minimum pain and maximum gain to the most amount of players involved. The only real loser is the shorts, and not even their own colleagues like them. Government/SEC intervention could very well be a death sentence for our market, while allowing the squeeze would result in rapid recovery and profound social good.

Hello wallstreetbets,

My name is Paul Rozanski and I’m a Psychology student at the University of Pécs in Hungary. The events around Game Stop and reddit have been amazing and too great of a research opportunity to pass up (a requirement for my program) so I got approval to carry out some research into how reddit, this community specifically, feels about everything that’s gone down.

&amp;#x200B;

This link is for a survey about people’s views on Justice, Fairness, and Institutional Investors

[https://www.psytoolkit.org/c/3.3.2/survey?s=fRtOa](https://www.psytoolkit.org/c/3.3.2/survey?s=fRtOa)

&amp;#x200B;

This link is to a google form which has questions I’ll use to conduct a narrative analysis.

[https://forms.gle/MwNScZiL2YRQesKE6](https://forms.gle/MwNScZiL2YRQesKE6)

&amp;#x200B;

You can fill out both they're not mutually exclusive. Naturally any and all data will be kept confidential and this research is non-clinical so it’s not as if I’m going to go ahead and diagnose everyone with some pathology or another. And of course if you have any questions you can message me here or at [nec.di.nec.domini@gmail.com](mailto:nec.di.nec.domini@gmail.com)

If you can help out with a response that’d be great. If not then I understand and hope you have a pleasant rest of your day.

58,m1iv7x,"To everyone reading this,

I began gaining interest in the stock market once the 2020 gains began. After lurking WallStreetBets for almost a year, I decided to finally join in December 17, 2020. I quickly bought the stock that got me into investing, TSLA at $600. I did other noob purchases of Fitbit and Nintendo because I did not know (still do not know) what I'm doing. Eventually I read all the talk about GME, BB, and AMC so I jumped in. I even sold my one TSLA at $800 to buy more GME. 

I was quickly gaining more and more money. I thought I would never see a day that I would not gain money. As soon as I hit a gain of $1000, it quickly came crashing down. Everything I owned just fell apart and at one point losing $700. I know it's not much for you big players but for someone new who had not seen losses before, I was scared. I have to admit I wanted to paper hand 📜✋ everything and call it quits so fast. It left a bad taste in my mouth. It is not money I cannot afford to lose but it still hurts!

However, I kept reading everyone's post. Everyone's hope was not lost and kept saying to just hold. I decided to just do the same. I learned to become numb of the losses, to not check my account, and eventually to not be scared.

I've held on and I have learned to diamond hand 💎 ✋ and trust all you retards. For that, I have gotten back to even and over finally again. You have restored my faith and now that I have learned to lose, I can continue with the stock market with a better mindset of it.
