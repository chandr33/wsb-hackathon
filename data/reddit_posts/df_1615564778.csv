3,m3kkig,"**I've been in this for a while.  I do know all is fair but, why do analysts opinions get released on option expiration days.  Just today;**

* **RBC downgraded Lennar to sector perform from outperform.**
* **Baird downgraded Quest to neutral from outperform.**
* **Deutsche Bank initiated MSCI as buy.**
* **Jefferies initiated Nordstrom as buy.**
* **Stephens upgraded Denny’s to overweight from equal weight.**
* **Citi reiterated T-Mobile as a top pick.**
* **Evercore ISI named Marvell a top pick.**
* **JPMorgan named Chevron and Exxon as top picks.**
* **Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Apple.**
* **Goldman Sachs upgraded Barclays to buy from neutral.**
* **Bank of America reiterated GameStop as underperform.**

**We all have option positions, and all need to open/close/roll those positions, often on expiration day.    While it really doesn't matter when these analysts spout their wisdom, it is a disadvantage to retail traders who might not have 24/7 access (day jobs?)to trading platforms when the release them on a Friday.  Perhaps it should be a common courtesy, like in golf, not walking on a putting line or talking when someone puts or in tennis shouting when they serve (using analogies that an analyst might relate to).  Its obvious the companies represented above don't give a dam about retail investors.  We should reciprocate the respect they show us.**",Common courtesy,1.0,1615564831,therealnorthwild

6,m3kl1n,"A while ago /u/cyphonismus made an excellent DD on one of the most clearly overvalued stocks on the market: [Seaworld Overvalued - SEAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lry7dt/seaworld_overvalued_seas/)

(due to all the GME hype, it didn't get much attention)

&amp;nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.

In other words, if take your 💩 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being about $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&amp;nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&amp;nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with *undervalued* stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one 🌈🐻 position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxf7y0/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i/))

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it.
