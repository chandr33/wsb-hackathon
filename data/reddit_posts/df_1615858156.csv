Come on everyone...there is no challenge right now to hold when it drops $45/share. Those are pansy numbers.

The real challenge will be when shares are hitting $10k, $27k, and even $68.9k. And suddenly the price drops 10%. There will be loads of FUD saying “just cashed out!!” There will be people posting fake (and even some real) gain porn showing them dumping LOADS of shares. There may be drops of 10%, 23% even 40% as hedges throw every trick they have to dismember your confidence.

DON’T GIVE IN! You are Spartan apes, you can hodl and diamond hand those shares because it only will work if we stay together strong. I’m looking for 1000x returns on my investment here and I’m not giving in until we reach that point. Don’t let them convince you that it’s happened, don’t listen to them saying it’s over, and don’t try to get fancy by selling and buying “the dip”.

Just burry your magic $GME shares in the anthill out back and let them grow a magic beanstalk to the castle in the clouds. It’s not rocket science to hold until the rocket takes you to the moon.

I am tired of reading people commenting that it’s worth nothing. It’s worth as much as we the investors want it to be valued. We are supposed to be controlling the value as shareholders. 

What do fundamentals mean anymore? Look at Tesla. You can’t go by fundamentals alone. So those of you saying the fundamentals aren’t there, STOP FOLLOWING WHATS HAPPENING WITH GME, move on we don’t need you. This is about upholding a brand that we believe in and we want to succeed. 

I have wanted to sell, but after seeing how much it is being manipulated, I will never sell. There’s much more at stake than getting a quick ROI. In January, it would have easily hit 1k if it weren’t for the cowardly actions of corporations.

OMG, we are still a long way off of having fleets of EV’s to replace combustion vehicles.  if we see oil production flat line or fall gas will be crazy expensive real quick. High fuels costs have been major headwinds for US businesses and middle class America.  We really need to hear what the plans is for managing the the changeover.  I hear my parents talk about the 70’s crisis (not the party’s) and the impact it had.

Strategically if I was OPEC, I’d sure as hell limit oil production to drive Cash Flow to reinvest in other energy developments to try to reincarnate my economy BEFORE the EV’s take over. Investing too late in the change over would be a disaster for them.  

Next OPEC meeting is only a couple weeks off, I’d bet they raise production a little, but with little to no US shale rig count increases seems little risk for them to continue to slow play production hikes.

I bought in with the rest of the first-day crowd when the share price was 69-something. That first week, it skips up to 77. It drifts back down to 69. Today, it dipped briefly to 67...and is now back up to 72. What will it be next?

I'm holding for the long term, so I wouldn't have been perturbed even if the share price plunged straight for hell (in fact, I'd have taken the opportunity to buy more) -- but man, maybe the GameStop saga has affected my imagination when it comes to share prices. Stocks are supposed to rapidly surge to never-before-seen heights, then plunge into the abyss! And then repeat the same dizzying acrobatics! That's life!

And it doesn't seem to have mattered that CEO Builderman took out [$83.9 million (!) in profit by unloading some of his shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roblox-corp-rblx-president-ceo-021506975.html) -- in fact, several other executives and Roblox insiders cashed out right after the direct listing, and that's still only a drop in the barrel compared to the company's current massive valuation. And people *still keep buying*. It was reported early on that Cathie Wood bought something like seven thousand times the number of shares that I did. I'm not a fan of hers, I think she's a very odd fish, but she's apparently good at picking stocks.

There isn't enough data in yet for any in-depth narratives. I saw a bunch of news articles (probably written by a bot) talking about how Roblox was up X% or down $X and all of it was so much garbage. You've got demand from investors, the desire of current holders to cash in, and it's right back where it all started! I mean, I dunno. If I had the guts, I'd have gotten in on GameStop, but -- what were the words? ""I like the stock""? I might as well be reading tea leaves when I say that I look at Roblox and think, yeah, I like that stock. That'll be a neat one to hold onto for awhile. Maybe years. Either they'll blow up even bigger than before, or they'll sorta peter out and I'll have to find someone to take some slightly devalued shares, and it's not like I bet the farm on it or anything. I'm still in, and I'll be in for a long time to come.

All this talk about buying ITM options on GME made me realize this potential for RKT. It just clicked. 

1) TDA and Schwab place short restrictions on RKT as of market close last Friday. (Hint hint)

2)finra shows short interest at 34.45%

3) it’s in an uptrend look at how close we are to pushing 50k of 28.89s open interest contracts this week into the money. 

4) RKT is on an uptrend and support is moving up above 26. As it moves up you WILL see volume. You WILL see wales put buying pressure. The last RKT move was a short squeeze, this will be a gamma squeeze and short squeeze. 

Open interest is 50k on 28.89s this week. If this gets ITM market makers will buy shares to cover. Guess what??? Once they buy those shares..the price will put 33.89s ITM. Then MM have to buy more shares....Guess what?!! There is another 15k of open interest contracts at 38.89!! Guess what? There is another 22k of open interest at 48.89s! 

Yes there is more! Shorts will piss their pants so it will not only gamma squeeze but also short squeeze at the same damn time. This is not a stock you want to fuck with. 

Ok one last time it gets better. New options will open up and retail will start buying in late as always. While shorts cover these higher options at 60-70 will start getting ITM too. MM will have to buy more shares to cover. 

Don’t limit the possibility of this. Look at the facts. 

Wait...There is a possibility of more. Say shorts start shorting it at $60 -$70 a share. They hammer it down. Then Dan and Jay think mhmm..we should initiate 1 billion dollar buy back at this good price of $40 a share. They get squeezed again and more contracts are itm. This could moon January GME style.
