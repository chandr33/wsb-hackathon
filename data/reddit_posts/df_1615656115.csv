17,m4avew,"This past week was incredible .... of course that’s on top of an already incredible story. 

DFV, Ryan Cohen, and many a smooth brained ape started this fight quite some time ago. Many doubted, but the momentum built and built until the huge spike at the end of January 2021. 

This first clash brought apes seeking opportunity, valuing GME, and of course those seeking to exploit the greedy HF’s who had overextended. As GME soared, new apes were drawn in. 

Then Melvin, citadel, RH, and other market manipulators did what they always do. Cheated. 

GME was soaring and apes were on their way to the moon. We all had our reasons for jumping in and why not?  Is it wrong to seek opportunity? Is retail not good enough to play the same game?

Apparently in the HF’s opinion we are all crayon eating bastards, it’s their game, and it only works if they make money. So they cheated, plummeted GME, and many apes were left floating in space. 

They didn’t care. They blamed retail. 

“Know what you’re investing in” 
“Meme stocks are volatile”
Distractions from where the real risk came from. Playing in a corrupt market with the facade of rules and structure. 

Sorry, but you can’t blame the apes who got left out there WHEN YOU CHANGED THE GAME! Trading halts that still allowed sells? What did you think would happen? If I’m an expert chess player and in the middle of the match the rules on how even a single piece can move are changed it puts me at risk! If I’m a retard, which i am, that just makes you even more pathetic that you can’t just play fair and beat me. 

There are many different apes in the GameStop game. Some of us have done years of research, DD, and like the stock. Others just came for tendies. 

Vlad called the initial swell a, “Black Swan Event”. Highly unlikely. 

Well Vlad, the Black Swan has returned. GameStop is again soaring. Over the past month it’s up 427%. And despite attempts to drive the price back down THE LINE HOLDS. 

This past week we saw some big moves. The battle intensified until Thursday and Friday where we fought to a standstill. Many apes were discouraged that the MOASS didn’t happen yesterday, myself included. Victory was within grasp. Pluto in our sights. But we are still in the trenches. 

But let’s not forget that GME is up 427% and holding! This is huge! We are making progress in a fight that was stacked heavily against us and we are holding!

Now stimmy’s are on the way. Hulu releases “Game Stopped” documentary this Monday. HF’s are bleeding money. 

This isn’t going to be easy and hasn’t been. But reinforcements are on the way. The HF’s are bleeding and all I have to do is HODL! I’m ready to got to Pluto and then some.  

I like the stock. I’m gonna build a house on it and stay here a while. Maybe forever. Doesn’t matter because that’s my smooth brained choice and the HF’s don’t get to tell me different. 

There’s a lot of dates being thrown around out there and maybe one of them is right. Doesn’t matter. I’ll be there when it happens cause I LIKE THE STOCK. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. IM RETARDED AND BRAIN WASHED. 

TL;DR 

I LIKE THE STOCK. VLAD SAID GME WAS ONE TIME EVENT. HERE WE ARE 1 MONTH LATER STILL UP 427%.  DFV IS NOT A CAT. NEW APES &amp; STIMMY’S INBOUND. I CAN STAY RETARDED LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!

60,m4bb9v,"For those in DKNG, there are potentially momentous events coming up in the next few months as state legislative sessions are coming to a close from now through about June. This could explain why there is a lot of unusual option activity around August at the 90c. 

The states in play and their progress on passing sports gambling either retail or mobile:

Texas: Two lawmakers filed legislation this week that would legalize casinos and sports betting in Texas. HJR133 was filed in the House on Tuesday and SJR49 filed in the Senate. The Texas Governor has also voiced support for the bill as well as the Sports Betting Alliance, which represents teams like the Dallas Mavericks, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Rangers. The Sports Betting Alliance has showed favoritism towards online sports betting too. This bill is supported between the two parties and the legislative session runs to the end of May. 

Florida: Legislative sessions are in progress and run to April 30th. The key part of negotiations is the Seminole Tribe of Florida. They offer a heavy endorsement as they run all casinos in the state of Florida. If they’re brought to the table in support of this bill soon, we could see some real pressure as the Governor is open to legalizing sports betting too. Though, as it stands, it doesn’t seem likely in this session. 

Arizona: Session ends on May 28th. Bill passed the House but faces political scrutiny in the Senate. Governor supports the legislation but its chance could end up grim if it gets stalled because of another bill trying to get horse racing on the ballot.

Maryland: Session ends in early-mid April (I think the 12th) Hogan is basically ready to sign this thing. It includes online sports betting too. This one practically a done deal.

South Dakota: March 29th marks the end of the session. The bill in this state easily cleared both the Senate and House. Governor is expected to sign off. 

Kansas: Session ends May 30th. The bill passed the Senate but its now in the House. Lawmakers in Kansas largely support the bill but there appears to be disagreements for who gets the gambling licenses. The Senate bill included 11 or 12 online gambling licenses, of which DKNG is included (of course).

DKNG could have a great year if some of these go through and could have an explosive one if they all do. The pandemic took a toll on these states and they need as much taxes as they can get. Sports betting is one way they can do that and it has bipartisan support across the aisle. Considering the DKNG already rose their estimates for the year, they could be thinking that their chances are looking good as well. As with all things political, buy the rumor and sell the news. Here’s to a maybe good year, my kings (and queens). Cheers 🍻",The DKNG Legislative Gamble,0.9,1615657715,blaclaureate

The Apple Car is coming, and it could be spectacular. At least, that’s what Citi analyst Jim Suva thinks.

Apple shares on Friday are down 1.8%, to $119.83, giving the company a market cap just a tad over $2 trillion.

 In a deep-dive research note Friday, Suva writes that entering the automotive market could be the catalyst that drives Apple’s market capitalization to $3 trillion from $2 trillion. While there has been plenty of talk about an Apple car, the company hasn’t addressed the possibility, and has a policy of not discussing future product plans.

75,m4beha,"***What is Shift (SFT)?***

* Shift, ticker $SFT, is an online platform where you can buy used cars and/or sell your used car. Their main competitors are Carvana and Vroom.

***I've never heard of Shift..can they even compete with big players like Carvana?***

* Used car sales are actually consistently greater than new car sales in the US, and for over a decade, the rate of used car sales has been growing faster than the rate of new car sales. The total used car market in the US was $841b in 2019, yet less than 1% of all car sales in 2019 occurred on an ecommerce marketplace like Carvana or Shift. This is at odds with the trends, as more consumers are moving towards doing most if not all of their shopping online. This trend was accelerated with the COVID 19 pandemic. There is plenty of space for growth in this category for several major players.

***What separates Shift from their competitors, such as Carvana and Vroom?***

* Shift has several unique features compared to their competitors. They are the only service in their space that offers free test drives at your home. If you see the car you like online, you can request to test drive it, and Shift will bring it to your door for you to test drive with no commitment to buy. They also focus on older cars compared to their competitors, specifically cars that are 3-5 and 6-10 years old. They also focus on cars that are less than $20k in price, with 40% of their sales being $10k-$20k and 16% being &lt;$10k. Cars of this age and price range are the largest segment of the used car market. For reference, 1-3 year old car listings comprise 48% of Carvana's and 68% of Vroom's listings, compared to just 25% of Shift's. Cars priced over $20k comprise 79% of Vroom's listings and 27% of Carvana's, compared to 20% of Shift's.

***Where does Shift operate?***

* They currently operate primarily in the west coast including California, the state with the largest number of vehicles sold per year, Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In Q4 of 2020, they launched four hubs in Texas, the state with the third largest vehicle market, in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, with more plans for future expansion.

***The Numbers***

Here's how Shift's current numbers stack up against their competitors:

SFT: $10:15

Carvana:  $286.69 

Vroom: $37.60

\*Note that Vroom is down nearly 33% this month and is just now approaching levels comparable to Shift at its current price level.

From the info above, we can see that by buying Shift, you are paying a lower multiple even when factoring in analyst's average estimates of larger growth (over 100%) in 2021 compared to their competitors.

***Recent Earnings (3/09/2021)***

Shift has been growing very rapidly and shows no signs of slowing down:

* In Q4 of 2020, they sold 4,666 units earning $73.4m revenue, representing 147% and 168% year over year growth and ended the year at $195.7m in total revenue (18% YoY growth) with 13,135 units sold.
* Their margins have also drastically improved, with their adjusted gross profit per unit in 2020 being $1,350 compared to $811 the year before, a 66% change. This has been largely due to their focus in 2020 on building up their in-house recondition (repairs/maintenance) team instead of relying on 3rd party mechanic vendors, with only 14% of cars being reconditioned by 3rd parties in Jan of 2021 compared to 45% at its peak.
* As they have grown their in-house reconditioning team's ability to process cars in house, they have invested significantly in acquiring inventory, and have increased their sellable inventory by 148% from December 2020 to March 2021.
* As of Dec 31st, 2020, the company had $234m in cash and cash equivalents and $49m in inventory, with $312m in total assets and $74.9m in total liabilities.

***2021 Guidance:***

* For Q1 of 2021, they are guiding revenue of $90m-$95m, representing 200-217% YoY growth. For 2021, they are expecting $450M in revenue, a 130% YoY increase and is inline with analyst's expectations, with $1,600 adjusted gross profit per unit, a 19% YoY increase, which is on track for their target of $2,500 in the next few years.

***Disclaimer***

* I hold shares in Shift and continue to buy at these prices as I am bullish on the company. Thanks for reading",Shift ($SFT) DD: A rapidly growing competitor to Carvana that seems undervalued,0.93,1615657974,ilovejheneaiko

_The Goodies_ (Blackrock, Vanguard &amp; Co) have been finessing and orchestrating the whole situation for a long time. 

_The Retarded Apes_ (Retail, Autists &amp; Co) are basically the Mr Bean Rollercoaster meme with Paper Handed Bishes fomo’ing on and off the ride.

The Goodies know that The Baddies will get butt-fucked if the price hits the trigger points of $300, $500 etc
The Baddies will use every tactic to keep the price down but they’re running out of synthetic tricks and laws to break.
The Goodies are deliberately riding out GME options every day making stacks of money knowing that the price is unlikely to break the trigger points because The Baddies can’t let that happen.

Will this game of fuckery will go on and on and on and on until The Goodies have finessed to the position they want?
Or The Baddies get margin called?
Or a massive catalyst overrides everything and fires the Rollercoaster into the stratosphere?

The Retarded Apes (proud to say I am one now) will just Hold on to the Rollercoaster until something gives?

On March 10th at approximately 12:10 PM EST GME shares hit a recent-high of $340.20.   


Moments later volume SPIKED to 1M at 12:15, 1.5M at 12:20, 3.10M at 12:25

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In literally 10 minutes millions of shares became available for sale and hit every single bid-ask on the buy side. Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.   


Ask yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.   


There is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).   


They're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.  


This strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.   


What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.   


[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)  


This attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.   


If you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down. The wall street motto is ""Greed is good"" and THEY WILL NOT GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT.

So now that they have tipped their hand that they will try try scare everyone into a Bank Run here are the KEY psychological targets they may drop shares at this week. DO NOT PANIC!

**Important price 1: $250**  
If they can 'break' the positive momentum and get the price below $250 that may signal a bank run and collapse the price. They may try this at open on Monday.

**Important price 2: $300**  
They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350.

**Important price 3: $340.20**  
This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  


**Important price 4: $350**   
Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400.  


**Important price 5: $400**

At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.   


**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**

As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.   


**TLDR:**  
There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time. DO NOT PANIC... It's what they want. Be prepared for the psychological games they will play. Remember NO SANE INVESTOR dumps shares at a loss or less of a profit...
