**Impact:** **""***The news sent MetalsTech share price up by more than 40 percent around the midday, with the company trading at 17 cents.***"" -** [BusinessNews](https://www.businessnews.com.au/article/MetalsTech-to-advance-lithium-assets)

News Link: [https://www.businessnews.com.au/article/MetalsTech-to-advance-lithium-assets](https://www.businessnews.com.au/article/MetalsTech-to-advance-lithium-assets) 

**Announcement Highlights:**

1. MTC to advance its high-grade lithium assets in Quebec *“off-balance sheet”* in response to the burgeoning battery metals sector and recent strong interest in its lithium assets, enabling it to focus its funds on developing its world-class Sturec Gold Mine.
2. **Independent JORC Exploration Target of 15-25Mt** @ 1-2% Li2O + 100-250ppm Ta2O5 (refer to ASX announcement dated 9 November 2017 and titled “Significant Exploration Target at the Cancet Lithium Project”)
3. MetalsTech's gold project is getting amazing drilling results including: 90m @ 3.88g/t Au.... 32m @ 4.62 g/t Au.... 70m @ 3.43 g/t Au..... The resource could triple from its current **1 million ounce** resource.
4. MTC appoints lithium industry veteran Mr. Chris Evans as ""Executive - Lithium Operations"" to deliver commercialisation strategy - **further details on the form of the commercialisation strategy will be provided to shareholders as soon as possible.**

**Also, Russell Moran (MetalsTech Chairman) added:**

""*To deliver maximum shareholder value, we are considering a range of commercialisation strategies designed to enable the company to focus its efforts on the continued development of the Sturec Gold Mine whilst also allowing the lithium assets to be developed in the most efficient manner. We have also been approached by several parties interested in acquiring Cancet outright, so naturally, the Company is reviewing all the options in order to achieve the optimum outcome.* 

 *We hired a famous lithium expert called Chris Evans, who built the Pilgangoora lithium mine sold recently to Pilbara Minerals for $200 million. He will help deliver shareholder value for MetalsTech.*""

Comparing Invesco to other REITs in particular,  I can't help but think that it's just lying dormant and about to explode any day now. Here's why:

\- Prior to COVID it was sitting comfortably between $11 and $23 for the past 15 years!

\- If you look back at 2008 you will see a very similar waterfall to what you saw in March when COVID hit, and it took less then a year for an almost complete bounce-back.  If history repeats itself, you're looking at an over 500% growth potential in a year (probably more though.)

\- It traditionally had a dividend yield of around 10-15%; They are currently at 8.5% (and rising)

\- They had some issues paying off their margin, but according to their last earnings report, they've managed to pay off all their debt, and they also exceeded earnings estimates.  They did need to sell off a few properties; not the end of the world though.

\- Are lower mortgage rates detrimental to a REIT??I honestly don't know.  Please let me know what you think.  I do know that property values have dropped; that seems like a positive to me.

\- and finally; just overall stability.  I think that $1.95 low right after COVID  was rock bottom. They are a business, they are adapting and making good decisions that are keeping them in the green and continuing to grow.  They only saw a 10% dip during last weeks down market and are currently continuing to hold their upward trend line very nicely. With the market currently going nuts, they have excellent market resistance.

If a $4 share with an 8.5% dividend becomes a $15 share with a 12% dividend;  You're going from $0.34 to $1.80 per share, per year, basically for the rest of your life in the form of dividends.  


That's almost a 50% ANNUAL return on investment!
