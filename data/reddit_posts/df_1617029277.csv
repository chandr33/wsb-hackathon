0,mfr62k,"First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit√§t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  ‚ÄúWe are going to deliver the world‚Äôs best software with the world‚Äôs most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that‚Äôs worth to them. And I think you‚Äôll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.‚Äù -Karp the day they went public",Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail.

  **SHARES DOWN 46%, IT'S TIME TO BUY THEM!!**

 What happened  Shares of US companies from the communications sector ViacomCBS, Discovery, as well as Chinese companies Baidu, Tencent Music and others went through a sell-off last week and lost tens of percent in value.  This happened against the backdrop of the forced closure of the positions of the investment company Archegos Capital Management, founded by Bill Hwang. This is reported today by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and many other business media.  According to WSJ, at the end of last week Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank quickly got rid of large stakes in these and other companies, and sales approached $ 30 billion as part of the liquidation of the positions of Archegos Capital, which, in fact, received a margin call. Margin call is a notification about the need to deposit funds to the account, sent to the client in case of a decrease in the value of his portfolio less than the size of the initial margin.

&amp;#x200B;

According to media reports, Archegos bought shares of the aforementioned companies not only for its own, but also for borrowed funds that were provided to it by brokers in the United States. When shares began to fall in price, and the company's funds were no longer sufficient to cover their positions, brokers, according to the typical procedure of margin lending, demanded additional collateral. When this did not happen, forced sales of these shares by brokers followed, which led to an accelerated decline in quotations, as each broker was in a hurry to cut their losses.

&amp;#x200B;

The Archegos Capital Management website is currently not available, no comments from the company are published.

Who suffered

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, there was a collapse in the shares of companies from the communications sector. Over the week, ViacomCBS's share prices fell 46%, Discovery - 50%, Tencent Music - 34%, Baidu - 19%.

&amp;#x200B;

Swiss Credit Suisse said Monday it was hitting a ""very significant"" hit in the first quarter after it began closing positions in a major US hedge fund that defaulted on margin calls last week. Credit Suisse is currently down 14%.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of the Japanese financial company Nomura fell 16% today in Tokyo. Nomura said in the morning that its US subsidiary is likely to incur a loss of about $ 2 billion. Nomura's losses are related to the Archegos deals, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of American investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are losing 2.5% and 1.6% in the premarket.

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Bill Hwang

&amp;#x200B;

Archegos Capital was founded by former Tiger Management stock analyst Bill Hwang. Bloomberg notes that Hwang, who worked for Julian Robertson at Tiger Management, set up the Archegos family office following the closure of his own hedge fund. Traders familiar with his trading style say that Hwang uses an exceptionally high leverage strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hwang was accused in 2012 of insider trading in shares of Chinese banks and fraud. He paid $ 44 million to settle illegal trading charges brought against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the incident.

What's next

&amp;#x200B;

The main wave of sales in ViacomCBS, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music and other companies apparently passed and most of Archegos' positions were liquidated, although there are news in the media that some of them still exist. That is, it is likely that these securities will not decline at the same rates. At the premarket today, they are in a small plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of investment banks were under pressure - the situation has not yet been fully clarified here, sellers may be active in the sector for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

Rotation from growth stocks to cyclical stocks was already on the agenda, and the story with Archegos could heighten fears of correction.

80,mfs1wx,"A couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.   
**Industry and Company Background:**   
Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to covid lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand. 

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year. 

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.  
With the uptrending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year. Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil. 

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.       
From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets. 

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.  
**The Hedge Fund Play:**  
In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.    
Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.   
To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.   
I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.  
Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.   
Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.  
In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

**Recently - New Play:**  
A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analysing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.   
My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Most legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.    
The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.   
This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.",Transocean (RIG) Hedge Fund Manipulation in Progress,1.0,1617031735,Eljefe2800

In my brilliance, I saw high premiums on DISCA calls and sold a shit ton of CC's on margin the last two weeks. Completely undiversified. In my defense, I didn't think someone else was gonna try to do something similar except with billions of dollars and also on 5x margin, making the stock drop 50% on no news. Average share cost $76.
