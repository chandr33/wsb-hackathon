24,mhe58t,"Hi all,

Firstly, congratulations to everyone who’s become a lot richer off the back of GameStop. I’ve seen some comments floating about that GME is a once in a blue moon event. But I’m wondering...why? 

Could we make more millionaires, surely it’s possible. I propose $MGCLF . MGC pharmaceuticals. 

Am I a biased shareholder? Of course I am, but what does it matter. Whichever stock gets chosen we can make this happen again. The current price point and company position I think makes $MGCLF a prime candidate for $GME 2.0. 

I know there will be haters saying there IS no other stock , GME IS the stock. But realistically there’s millions of people in this group now that either;

A) Missed the boat because they didn’t know 

B) Priced out by the share price 

The difference this time is we have more people , more power. I think we need to ignite the fire now more people are ‘in the know’ and a stock that’s priced at a substantially lower cost, and properly come together to make it happen.

We can pump this stock higher than the product gets you. 

Who’s in?

Even with QE on, yields are going up and long term bond prices continue to dwindle (check the long term bond ETF TLT out).

The bond market is languishing obviously because of dovish fiscal policy and positive sentiment in the stock market over the bond market. We are continuing to see a steepening yield curve.

Some [brilliant autist](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on r/GME went on a deep fucking dive into what financial institutions like citadel and blackrock are doing in the treasury bond market.

Turns out they are shorting the everliving shit out of it. They are doing it through various channels like the repo market (whatever the fuck that is) and are so god damn sure it’s going to go down they aren’t even providing or requiring the needed collateral for these trades.

If these massive companies are raw dogging these bets with minimal to no protection, they must be pretty certain of the outcome (bonds will continue to decline).

So they are betting to the tune of billions and billions of dollars through special OTC markets that treasury bonds prices will decrease, cool. What can we do? My thoughts are puts on TLT or buying TMV (3x inverse ETF on long term treasury bonds).

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE, IM JUST A BRAINDEAD APE WHO LIKES STONKS.

Im here today to talk about 88 Energy Ltd.

IM PASTING PARTS OF OTHER'S DDs, THE POINT HERE IS NOT TO SELL YOU THIS COMPANY BUT TO PRESENT YOU A LOW-PROFILE COMPANY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OUT OF YOUR RADAR.

DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Sorry if it's to late for you, i had to wait untill 1Bn cap so mods don't kill the post, i'd say something earlier but, you know... those rules...

88 Energy has had a negative net profit for while, no income at all, obviously the stock price went to hell.

This quarter (late February-early March) they will start pumping oil in their new Merlin-1 well. They recieved the permit to pump earlier than expected.  
This well is expected to supply 645 million barrels. Its in the Alaska North Slope Basin and this area is known for its success when it comes to oil discoveries.

 In this area 88E owns some other land patches (Project Peregrine it's called) and in total they are exptecting to drilll 1.6 billion barrels. 480 million barrels of which are net to 88E's 30% retained interest.

The operating costs of Charlie-1 will be fully funded by Premier Oil which accounts to US$23 million. 

The price target was expected to be €0,04 while the current price is €0,0648. The stock has gone +980% in litle more than a month,

Even though they made a loss the last couple of years, they still have a good debt to equity ratio 

Now the drilling and logging of the well is almost completed and the results seems to be pretty decent.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

88Energy has gone almost +1000% in a month, it passed from 0 income to drill an estimated 1.6 billion oil barrels.

Price has incresed by 62% just today.

It's price was set to €0.04 now it's almost €0.07

&amp;#x200B;

PERSONAL OPINION

I dont know if i'd buy at todays close price, looks a little overbought tho

I think it could keep going up to €0.1 but even if you dont agree, POQ is an interesting stock to monitor from now on. For both shorts and long

# Background

I did a detailed DD on here for $CLF 23 days ago when it was trading at $14.12 (now $20): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m009uv/clf\_cleveland\_cliffs\_rocket\_fuel\_cant\_melt\_these/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m009uv/clf_cleveland_cliffs_rocket_fuel_cant_melt_these/)

That DD on America's largest HRC steel producer is still accurate.  This update is taking place during Biden's Infrastructure talk - a catalyst that DD outlined and I expect will unlock even further value. My positions have shifted a slight bit but I've still not sold the core of them as the stock remains undervalued. I'll briefly outline why I'm still holding.

# Quick DD Updates

* [Guidance for 2021](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/summary/?id=182331&amp;pr=true) was released at $3.5B EBITDA for the entire year. [Due to a tax write-off situation they have](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/m9cp4f/comment/grplski), $CLF has very little in terms of taxes they will need to pay in 2021. The end result? This should translate to a EPS of $4 to $5 per share based on the existing roughly 500M float. From the original DD, [an analyst gave it a $25 PT](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/417f31ecdb104c28951687562221fd19.html) based on just a $3.18 EPS.
* But that's not the end of the upside! This guidance was released after the CEO made comments are a conference on their upcoming EBITDA. At that conference, he stated he felt they would make [$3.5B EBITDA cumulative by the end of Q3](https://stocktwits.com/Will_Sonnett/message/310078967). This means the guidance is conservative compared to what the leader of the company is telling his peers!

# Price Targets

The most bear case now has $CLF trading at a pathetic 5x P/E multiple and there is upside that could occur over the conservative guidance given. I'm personally holding for around $25 in the short term and $30 in the longer term that just brings $CLF's valuations up to par with the cheapest P/E ratios of its peers. Why would I sell early at a cheap price when the mystery of how the company looks to perform has been removed and it turns out the analysts were wrong?

Hi fellow apes and retards, 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've all followed the news, or even the daily charts here on Reddit, you've read that Bill Hwang has received a margin call of several billions, probably the largest margin call ever seen. In this article, I'd like to connect the dots for you guys on that call.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bill Hwang** has made an incredible fortune on Wall Street. With Archegos Capital Management (ACM), he and a lot of employees are trading nonstop to achieve financial freedom, about a million times financial freedom. To many of us is that a dream, some are on their way, others are starting their journey to what Bill Hwang has accomplished. My reason for this article is that **we all can make the same mistakes as mr Hwang did**, although it will be one of a smaller size, it's impact on our lives can be just as large as it is to Bills. We should learn from him.

**So why does he even get margin called? He's got a fortune, right?** Well yeah, he does. Or actually, he does, but he's also got a bazillion of leverage. Basically, what Bill did, is he got a $600 share for about $100 of his own money, the other $500 was a loan. Unlike what some say, loans are okay, every major company has loans, and they are able to borrow money because they have assets.

The same goes with ACM and Bill Hwang. As they bought something worth $600 with $600, that's fine you would say. Except he didn't actually buy it. Bloomberg reported that Bill was trading in swap stocks and leveraged **contracts for difference, or CFDs**. These are legal in Europe, not anymore in the US. a CFD is basically agreeing to deposit $600, with the same price flow as Stock X, and when it goes to $800, you get the difference in your bank account **immediately**. 

One of the most quotes here on reddit, and especially in the much volatile GME thread, is: **You only lose when you sell.** But in the case of Bill Hwang and CFDs, that is actually **false** because he doesn't buy any asset, he deposits money that replicates the same price movement as an asset. And still, that's okay, even when leveraged, that's okay, because it allowes to replicate a $600 stock with just $100, and when it goes to $800, you have $200 extra in your account. 

Now let's say we got another example. In this case, We have stock B that is currently trading at a $100 price. Bill has got $100, so he would buy 1 CFD. But when he leverages this with $500, he's now able to buy 6 CFDs. If the price of stock B moves to $150, he would not have $50 in profit, but now, **6 times as much**, which makes $300! The value of the CFDs is now 6 x $150 = $900, $500 being borrowed, $100 initial deposit, and $300 profit.

Bill came up with a great plan. He's got the $300 immediately in his account. Stock B trades at $150 and Bill expect it to rise even more. So bill takes his $300 profit, and of buying 2 stocks, he leverages it with the same 5:1 ratio and get about $1500 in leverage. Now, he's able to buy 12 more CFDs of $150 each. **Bill has only invested $400 of his own money, but owns 18 CFDs, worth $2700!** 

Now here's comes scary part. Bill doesn't own a stock asset at all. He has something that replicates the movement of a stock. It may well be that the price goes down, even tho Bill has great interest in the stock. **As Bill didn't buy any stock, but a CFD, the price doesn't move up or down by Bill's moves.**

As he doesn't own the stock, the underlying asset is.... (surprise)... **his bank account**! And in that bank account is $2000 leveraged, $100 initial deposit, $300 in profit. That's only $2400. You ask where the rest is? There is no other $300. It is leveraged profit from the first 6 CFDs. 

Now let's say the price goes down from $150 to a price of $125 per stock B. That means his 18 CFDs decrease $25 each, **he's lost a whopping $450.** Bill's only got $125 x 18 CFDs = $2250 now. And that's also okay, because he borrowed $2000 and invested $100 initially. He's got $150 in total profit, still. Please note: this gets immediately charged on this bank account value, because as profits do, losses do too.

But what happens when the price goes to, let's say, back to $100? His underlying asset, his bank account, is only valued at 18 CFDs worth $1800 in total. It starts getting tricky because the bank wants their $2000 back. **The profit and initial deposit have vanished.**

At a certain, pre-defined point, the bank does not want to take more risk of losing the $2000 loan because Bill is nearly broke. As the price goes to about $50, 18 CFD value at $900, Bill needs to pay a lot back and he hasn't got any assets supporting him and eventually leads to a predefined margin call. This can be tackled by diversification, but as we saw in the tech stocks, if a full sector or even multiple sectors decrease, this gets tricky.

 That's why profits can be great, but continuous reinvesting of profits can make a slippery slope.",Why Bill Hwang got margin called,1.0,1617221433,Baarluh

85,mherjj,"I threw $500 into an account in January to try playing with the market. I lost almost all of it on bad calls - or so I thought. I am no longer as convinced of my own stupidity.

Today, one of my calls (GSM, too small for WSB, so I'm not talking about the stock) went up to $0.48. I figured this was around the cap on what I'd get out of it, so I had placed a sell order pre-market at $0.50.  I watched the ask count go down from 150 to **10.** My options were not sold, and the peak value shows as $0.48 in RH. The value has dropped back down to $0.30 since. 

TLDR: If you try and sell at the peak with RH, and anyone else is trying to with you, you are last. You are not going to sell. Someone else who holds those options will get to sell before you, one way or another. Get a decent broker now; today I lost 10x as much money as all my trades having $0.85 fees combined would have cost me.

88,mherz3," Hope everyone is having a great Wednesday (my dudes)!

Just checking in with my **GME** stocks I'm hodling, after hodling through **January's gamma squeeze**, the **February stalling** and the **March spike followed by the dip** the HFs created and being now in the red without a single drop of sweat but also without a single added wrinkles to this smooth brain :)

Instead I was sweating all through December and January at a horrible job, far from friends and family for Christmas and New years, got spiraled down into serious depression and addictions while crunching out those extra hours of working so I can finally leave while also continuing investing in GME.

As of today I can happily admit that I had enough willpower to leave my toxic workplace and grab a hold of my life, as I am currently working at 2 different jobs (both better than the previous) thus making more money with less stress I had before, also I am completely sober for 1 month TODAY, all this while I **HAVE BEEN SLOWLY BUT STEADILY INVESTING IN GAMESTOP. Since January I used to have 8 shares, now its the nice round number of 30.09 shares and I know it's not MUCH compared to some apes but.....**

**IT'S HONEST WORK.**

I'm still a lonely ape far from my ape ancestors and other ape friends, but I am happier than I have ever been in the last months, thanks for my faith and dedication and for the wonderful community that has assembled on this subreddit and the overall sentiment we have for this great stock and each other!

**Thank you all APE HODLERS from everywhere around the world, and remember:**

**APE NO FIGHT APE! SPREAD THE POSITIVITY!**
