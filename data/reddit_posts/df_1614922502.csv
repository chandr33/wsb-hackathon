24,ly5d87,"***Tldr: NVAX is down over 35% in the last 3 trading sessions and 53% since the ATH 17 days ago and now has a market cap of $11.8B. This is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original COVID variant (95.6%) and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for 2021. If trading at close to 1X price/sales (anticipated) isn‚Äôt enough, NVAX is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile. NVAX is an incredible deal right now at $155/share.*** 

\----------------------------------------

Refer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of NVAX‚Äôs vaccine, particularly my last post on 1/28.

 

**Recap of how we got here**

* On January 28th NVAX reported best in class interim results from their Phase 3 UK trial (95.6% efficacy against original COVID variant) which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks, peaking at over $300/share. See summary figure from RA Capital below outlining NVAX's vaccine performance against the competition.
* Since then, several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmed/finalized, and NVAX has secured orders for \~200M doses, which CEO has indicated will be \~$20/dose:
* Additionally, NVAX has confirmed agreements for \~1.4B doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with Japan, South Korea, and India/COVAX.
* NVAX completed enrollment for US/Mexico Phase 3 trial on February 22nd and will likely report interim results in March. 
* Earnings on March 1st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bi-valent COVID vaccine, however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the UK phase 3 trial completion and US EUA.
* Shares continued to slide over the last 2 days due to broader market conditions closing at $155/share today

**NVAX remains well positioned despite being behind PFE, MRNA, and JNJ**

Based on several comments I‚Äôve seen over the past few days, it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for COVID vaccines outside of the US and that NVAX already has an agreement with the US to provide 110M doses. Yes, the US is vaccinating millions of people every week, but we‚Äôve known for months that NVAX was going to be approved after PFE/MRNA/JNJ and nothing has changed on that front. For the first wave of vaccinations, the US market was never going to be the major revenue generator for NVAX. It was always going to be about the ex-US market for 2021/2022. 

As of today, NVAX has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing, which CEO suggested earlier this week will be \~$20/dose:

* Canada: 52M doses w/ option for additional 24M doses
* UK: 60M doses
* Australia: 51M doses w/ option for additional 10M doses
* New Zealand: 11M doses
* Switzerland: 6M doses

This does not include ongoing negotiations with the EU, which have been [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-novavax/eu-close-to-vaccine-supply-deal-with-novavax-sources-idUSKBN2AB10H) to involve supplying 100M doses with an option for another 100M. There will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks. 

During the earnings call on Monday, CEO confirmed that all 8 manufacturing sites are making GMP product, with US and SK performing final fill. This is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of \~160M doses/month once all sites are fully operational in mid-2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**New COVID variants (P.1 &amp; B.1.429) can escape prior immunity to original COVID variants and vaccination with 1st-generation COVID vaccines**

Several lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the COVID variants in circulation are capable of immune escape. This is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective (as we‚Äôve already seen) and will need to be updated in the future. It also isn‚Äôt hard to imagine that in another 6-12 months, after more of the population has been vaccinated, that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that we'll need to think about. 

Ultimately, this means that we‚Äôre very likely going to need updated COVID vaccines with some level of frequency. NVAX and MRNA are already working on bi-valent formulations that will cover at least two variants and there‚Äôs very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years. Due to the nature of their vaccine platform, NVAX is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future. I went through this in more detail in my last post, but to summarize:

* NVAX‚Äôs high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein (5¬µg) in their current formulation and they tested up to 25¬µg during phase 1 trials with no change in side effects. As a result, they have the ‚Äúspace‚Äù to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that they‚Äôre already working on this. 
* PFE/MRNA have much less ‚Äúspace‚Äù to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as they‚Äôre already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mRNA can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity. Safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation, particularly for MRNA, which was the subject of a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper ([NEJM paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102131?query=featured_home)). Consequently, MRNA‚Äôs bi-valent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mRNA at 100¬µg. Still, safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose 1 to dose 2 due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose 2 to dose 3.
* JNJ and AZN‚Äôs platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the DNA sequence encoding the antigen. Both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations

&amp;#x200B;

NVAX will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent FDA guidance ([link](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download)). As a result, future trials will be able to take place much faster, and the speed advantage for mRNA-based platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials. NVAX is undervalued at $155/share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be. 

 

**NVAX is insanely cheap at an $11.8B market cap**

I haven‚Äôt performed any financial modeling so I‚Äôm not going to give a price target beyond saying it‚Äôs much higher than $155. Instead, I‚Äôll point you to the only four analysts who‚Äôve provided updated price targets since earnings on March 1st:

* Eric Joseph (JP Morgan): $285/share
* Kelechi Chikere (Jefferies): $310/share
* Charles Duncan (Cantor Fitzgerald): $338/share
* Mayank Mamtani (B. Riley): $397/share

For comparison, two other COVID vaccine makers CVAC and BNTX have market caps of $15.2B and $22.9B, respectively. CVAC has no approved products and a COVID vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development. BNTX is the inventor of PFE‚Äôs vaccine and shares revenue with PFE. Yes, both CVAC and BNTX are getting a premium for their pipelines, but NVAX has a pipeline as well, with a Flu vaccine that successfully completed phase 3 prior to the pandemic and an RSV vaccine in clinical development, both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their COVID vaccine.

**Positions**

Shares

3/19 $200, $220, $240 (bought on the way down; might be a little aggressive right now)

4/16 $250, $300, $350 (a few of these were spreads that I closed the short leg on today during the selloff; spreads are a good option for NVAX bc of the high premium)

7/16 $250/$400 call spreads
