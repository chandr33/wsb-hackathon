1,m67vqd,"Fellow apes, if my smooth brain knows anything it's that the hedgies will do anything to protect themselves. This leads to a very interesting scenario in which it backfires more and more on them. This could take hours, days, months or even years. So as people keep saying, be patient and don't target dates.

But, before long, we will be marching through the gates of Valhalla with crayons in hand and beating our ape chests to see our friends who have become heroes in this episode. Retards and Autists alike will stand side by side, bathing in the glory.

All the research and all the DD doesn't mean a whole lot to me anymore, I believe in this stonk and that's all that matters. Many will fall along the way but those left standing will reap the rewards, taking from those who took from the general public.

Personally, I will be picking up more stock during this beautiful dip and will sit and wait for those tendies to start printing.

Of course, this is all speculation and if you see this as any sort of advice, then please get your smooth brain checked. I'm just a dumb ape who knows nothing.",For me... I will be buying this GME dip,1.0,1615897511,Moaxxe

10,m67wwl," 

[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) has gained a lot of popularity for his incredible ROI this year.

Many people wait for his famous ""YOLO UPDATE"" that he posts every now and then.

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

**DFV was just like you and me.**

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

The secret to his success was ... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

I won't let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).

No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.

I will **hold.**",The Importance of DFV's example,1.0,1615897623,efalco02

The uptick rule doesn't actually mean much as they can still ladder attack, but just have to generate a slight bit of green dildo for this. They will have algos for days and different variants too so they can properly try to fuck retail. 

This is a good sign that they are scared and need the price to be Lower. This also has cause and effeft as with the stimmies, the lower it goes the more shares get bought and in turn it means more volume. 

Anyway, expect the worst and expect it to be a steady drop unless volume counters. It seemed a slow day yesterday with $AMC doing bits on that front, which is why the charts didn't exactly mirror for once. 

Don't be scared by the artificial dips, it a bounced back well when the attacks come.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs again

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

&gt; * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

&gt; * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

&gt; # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

&gt; * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

&gt; * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

&gt; # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

&gt; * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

&gt; # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

&gt; * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

92,m6894i,"Hello,
Today we are opening a new chapter, a chapter of independency.
We live in an age where our lives and mind are being harvested to our digital emperors. Some of our choices are made by us and some are made “for us”.
I get it, the digital revolution has made us closer. New borders were made - financially, politically and culturally. But as the the internet expands and the corporal tentacles grow we were soon to realize that we are not the ones in profit. 
Today i present to you- Music Bets. 
A social platform for people who are into independent/alternative music and want to enforce the financial infrastructure of the creators that they appreciate.
What I mean by enforcing is to simply discuss new music and apply streams to the artists. This battle is not against the streaming platforms nor the record labels. We simply want to help artists to be able to have minimal exposure and financial freedom. As we saw with “Wallstreetsbets”, today have the power to make micro changes as individuals and big as a whole. 
Thank you very much,
