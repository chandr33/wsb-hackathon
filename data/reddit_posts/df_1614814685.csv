4,lx7i43,"The reason palantir was down recently was due to lockup expiration, which happened on Feb 18.

Early investors and employees that hold their shares for over a decade was able to sell portion of their shares to buy their new shiny car, house, and/or other reasons, had already done so. This create a very healthy pullback.

Now is your chance to pick up the best long term AI and data analytic company with the biggest moat in tech.

Consider these factors:

\-High Growth in the hottest AI and data analytic industry with a lot of IP.

\-Very low debt with $2 billion hand in hand.

\-Very high Gross Margin and Operating margin that keep going up as revenue increase at the same time, means that are really well run and they'll be very profitable in the future. They would have made a profit of $170million from the last 2 quarters if it wasn't for stock-based compensations.

\-Sticky customers that include governments and big expertises.

\-Limitless use case across almost any industry. Help BP become greener. Aid in cancer research. Help prevent wildfire in california. Help distribute the vaccine for covid-19. Help prevent future pandemic and disasters. Basically limitless use cases that help any corporation or government run large amount of data to discover the truth behind their data.

\-Palantir create disruptive future software that is ready for prime time and only recently started to get adopted by large corporation.

\-Great leadership

\-Cream of the crop employees. Beat out all of the FANNG companies.

\-No real competitors. Huge moat. One of the co-founder is Peter Thiel, also a co-founder of Paypal, and the author of ""Zero to One"". Where his philosophy is  always ""aim for monopoly, competition is for losers "".

\-Very forward looking. They create technology not for the past, but for the future need. Karp, their CEO said their goal is to become the world most ""important software company"" in the future.

\- They are able to create test simulation on your whole companies to see how different components affect your overall business from top to bottom and see how one change can affect the entire organization.

\-Create massive value for their clients by saving cost and becoming more efficient.

\-Allow any employees from your organization to make meaningful contribution without hiring costly data scientist that only perform ad-hoc task.

\-SaaS with apollo. Apollo allow SasS to be in almost anything like a submarine, with little or unstable internet connection, harsh environments, humvees, and etc. Before Apollo everything is frozen in time with old and unsecured legacy preinstalled software.

\- Interactive and easy to use user interface that is customizable to whatever you want.

\-Can be integrated with private cloud, AWS, google cloud, hybrid cloud, etc.

\-Highest level security trusted by the government.

\-They can now massively scale their services.

\-Significantly reduced their deployment from Months down to Hours and Days.

\-Ontology create a overview and blueprint of the entire organization and see how each component interact in real-time.

\-Modular of their foundry software for small and mid-size business

\-Recent partnership with IBM increase palantir's Sales force from less than 30 to over 2000. Palantir was able to grow to \~1 Billion annually revenue with virtually no salespeople before 2020.

\-no code, abstract away time consuming processes, saving organization from hiring costly computer scientist, giving business managers/executive with no coding background, no CS degree, or no data science degree ability to contribute and make meaning decisions from the bottom up. Just like Windows did for the personal PC, Palantir is doing it for data analytics and AI. This is a big deal. The next frontier of technology after data analytics and AI, It is going to be bigger than the internet.

\-Allow data from different silos and types to flow in real-time to make better decisions. What life have taught me is that making the right decision at the right time is the most important thing in the world.

\-Constantly adding new features and making improvements to existing product line. Foundry for business was only released in a couple years ago and Apollo was only released in 2020, but it already made significant impact on their up and bottom line.

\- There is no doubt that big data analytics and AI is next technology that is going starting to go mainstream and is going to be a big game changers and will create massive wealth for first adaptors because it is a winner takes all market.

The progress of technology:

Internet-&gt;Personal PC-&gt;Web Search-&gt;Ecommerce-&gt;Social Media-&gt;Smartphone-&gt;Cyber Security-&gt;Cloud Computing-&gt;Streaming-&gt;cryptocurrency-&gt;Automation-&gt;Data Analytics-&gt;AI

Data Analytics-&gt;AI is the last frontier and will create the most value and wealth because their application is limitless.",Palantir is undervalued and is time for it to finally take off.,0.86,1614814773,2443222

* 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.
* UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop.
* Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.
* Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months.
* Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn‚Äôt allow the stock to drop so low again.

 This is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don‚Äôt think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don‚Äôt see these concerns as significant right now.

They also secured market access agreements for **Fubo Sportsbook** in Indiana and New Jersey through **Caesars Entertainment Inc.** With an existing agreement in Iowa.

**Shorts dug their own grave today,** they shorted an additional 10% of the float today on an EPS miss when the stock was already down.

They are playing the same fucking game they did with **$RKT.**

Short on a blowout ER, then get blown out 2 days later.

$FUBO got hammered all day, but the company waited until after hours to release the fucking Kraken.

**Absolute CHAD move. Shorts are stuck, nowhere to run, and FUBO is fighting back.**

The news sent $FUBO instantly up 6% - where its possible more shorts piled in.

**The current short interest is floating @ about 37% ( 20 million shares ) after today's close.**

They‚Äôve got 3 events coming up in the next 2 weeks which I think paired with the huge partnerships they're making with major players will trigger the home-run, touchdown, **SPORT SQUEEZE**.

Their earnings report was the best in the history of the company, monster growth in all important aspects, very similar to a popular emoji.

* **Their subscribers are up 73% YoY ( massive )**
* **Revenues up 93% QoQ ( huge )**
* **Average ad revenue per user has doubled YoY since 2018**

FUBO is growing faster than anyone expected, even faster than FUBO expected, they've had to revise estimates constantly to account for increased growth. Shorts have nowhere to go, and the next 2 weeks FUBO is going on a media fueled short execution mission.

The sports betting industry is exploding as well, and FUBO is best positioned to capture this burgeoning market. Streaming Service + Sports Betting under one roof? Count this retard in.",$FUBO + Caesar's + NBA + MLB = Media Fueled SPORT SQUEEZE,0.79,1614815408,tendeeznuts
