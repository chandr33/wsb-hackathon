So I've been holding my shares as advised, while constantly buying more when the prices dropp.  So why is it significant  that on Friday the Market closed at around 11.16?  

As I continue to stubbornly hold, what does ending at 11 do?  What kind of expectations are more realistic in the coming week?

7,m3t5hu,"Anyone think it's a bit sTrAnGe that Congress reintroduced the Fair Wage Act on January 26, 2021 -- the **exact** day that Gamestop soared over $100 a share for the first time -- only to later have it voted against by their own party members?  

My thought is that the Fair Wage Act being introduced on January 26th, 2021 was a way for Congress  (under the pressure of Wall Street) to bait and switch the national attention away from Wall Street corruption and onto a different scandal

* This effectively allowed big Wall Street investors to save billions of dollars by minimizing the number of retail investors who got involved by hearing about it 
* And minimized the attention the media put on their shady restrictions + practices for controlling the bleed (cough cough Robinhood)

In the long run, Congress will end up raising minimum wage, but making a pointless fight about it right now allowed them to shift the national focus away from something they actually give a shit (and a couple million dollars) about: Wall Street

**It was all a bait and switch.**

Ok ok I know I sound like someone who took too much adderall and has a lot of ideas... but bear with me.  

* ***ON THE EXACT DAY (jan 26)*** **that the Fair Wage Act (aka raising minimum wage) was reintroduced, Hedge Funds / Wall Street had billions at stake because retail investors (aka us) were making $GME and $AMC explode.**
* Many of the Congressmen + women profit off the same corrupt wall street tycoons (cough cough citadel) that were invested in squashing the retail investors who beat them at their own games. 
* Democratic candidates received **$8.7 million in campaign contributions** **from Hedge Funds** in 2020
   * Not to mention the vast majority of career congressmen are millionaires with their money in hedge funds
* Raising minimum wage is a bit of a Democratic congress no brainer right?  
   * It's the year after essential workers (many of which making minimum wage) consistently risked their lives in a pandemic AND the majority of the country's popular vote supports it. 
* A fight over the minimum wage was the most effective way to hijack the country's economic attention away from retail investment and wall street corruption -- especially when many of the retail investors participating had jobs on minimum wage.
* Wouldn't it be iRoNiC if the same Democrats who shot it down later approve it under curiously similar bill terms but when the national attention is fully away from wall street corruption
* There were multiple reasons Wall Street would have wanted to shift the national attention from retail investments:
   * The more people we told to get involve, the more our stonks rose aka the more money Wall Street lost
   * They didn't want people to keep discussing how Robinhood and the other fucked platforms introduced fucked restrictions at the pressure of big money wall street crooks (cough cough Citadel) 

Ok I'm done thank you for coming to my Ted Talk go ahead and roast me.

11,m3t6fr,"Gamestop has an ER on March 23. Its financials and revenue will be meh with maybe some postitve guidance. Its big ticket item will be Ryan Cohen and a promise to investors to restructure and maybe some jokes about the stock price. 

This good news will send GME up and it will get Gamma Squeezed out of the fucking solar system. 

GME has been trading sideways since it got Gamma'd on Feb 24th with some notable dips and rips ever since, for it to maintain this price action so long is telling. Telling that there is not much selling happening, people want this stock, and there is likely some institutional investment at this point both serious and jokingly. 

I think it will continue to trade sideways until the ER, otherwise the price action makes no sense. GME is worth $20 on a good day, for this to be the new normal is intentional and not a reflection of its underlying fundamentals. I think someone is orchestrating something, either that, or the stock is genuinely being propped up by retail investors which seems unlikely. 

Last two points, Gamma Squeezes are causing the price action not Short Squeezes, best estimates are that only 30% of float is shorted. Second point, stimulus checks drop in this weekend and next week, and GME Holders are already plannning to blow it on GME which could initiate another major Gamma Squeeze. 

So the saga continues until after ER by my best guess.

Also a lawsuit about misappropriation of funds having been filed.

Now this was sent to me anonomously and I am trying to see if they will send me the emails about the 401k movement date. Edit - added to post, see below.

This is unverified and could be a shill leaking bad data.  Anyway you wonderful apes can do some digging on this?  Edit - seems to be checking out, added docs and lawsuit checks below.

A $360 GME put is worth $17,000 right now. It’s not even close to that price, and that’s a PUT. I firmly believe puts will rise along with the stock, unlike normal stocks. A lot of people are going to expect it to drop after it moons.

How do you guys feel about this ape theory? I fully expect AMC to moon, hence why I think owning both puts and calls would be the safest bet. 

oooooo oooo ahhh ahhh",How does WSB feel about AMC put options?,1.0,1615590611,AxelAlden
