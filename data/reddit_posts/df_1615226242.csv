16,m0lmhd,"**Hello fellow retards**

I just wanted to make sure you're all doing OK on this semi-turbulent monday. I know there are a lot of relatively new people here (myself included). We're seeing a lot of activity in the meme-stocks today and I know some people have YOLO'ed everything from their entire portfolios to their life savings into stocks like GME. 

**GME is past 200! What now?**

Sure would be nice if the stock just soared past 200 today and stayed there, without any resistance, wouldn't it? Sometimes (rarely) it works like that, but most times it doesn't. Grab your wife and her boyfriend's latest erotic VHS tape and be patient. The stock is going to dip plenty of times (probably) and we might even see a big spike past 200, followed by a massive dip to get people to panic sell (probably x 2). Maybe it'll just rocket to the moon. In that case, disregard this post entirely (which you should be doing regardless, to be honest).

**I'm in the green now, should I sell immediately?**

That's a good question ape. Now, this is not advice to you specifically, but

Firstly; if you can't handle seeing your investment going back and forth between red and green so much - don't invest in heavily volatile stonks like GME is right now, in the first place. Especially not with your entire fortune. And if you're new at this, for the love of GOD, **stay away from options**. Just embrace the FOMO and stay out of it, because it will drive you insane with anxiety and worry for what tomorrow will bring. Play the long game instead. That's what I'd do.

***Memes aside, please rethink investing in volatile stonks again. For your own mental health.***

Secondly; I'll paint you a picture:

&amp;#x200B;

[My skills in paint are undeniable](https://preview.redd.it/llavwukd4ul61.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a75c127f384b820b7217b7f294709ee00a92a2)

See where you sold? Bet you felt pretty good when the stock dropped immediately after. Bet you felt pretty silly too when it went back up again and just kept on going. 

Thirdly; I don't fucking know, do whatever you want.

**WHO ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO?**

I literally just told you that I wasn't offering you advice. I'm a nobody. I remember when I went to kindergarten and my brain had more wrinkles than it does now. Imagine dipping an apple in paint and setting it out to dry - that's how smooth my brain is. That's why I'm not offering you financial advice. I'm not telling you you should - or shouldn't - sell. If you're up 250% from your initial investment and you want to cash out (sir, this is a casino) then more power to you.

I'm just telling you to **strap your wife's boyfriend's used underwear to your face**, take a good whiff, calm down and don't be rash.

Breathe. In, out, in, out. Did that calm you down?

**Yeah. So, uh, what EXACTLY is the point of this post?**

The point of this post is to do exactly that - calm you down a little. At this point this is a marathon, not a sprint. Let the adrenaline burn out before you burn yourself out. Get you to take your eyes off those green numbers and read something else while you eat some crayons. It's also to tell you that odds are whatever we retailers do at this point will probably have no significant impact on how it plays out - unless 75% of us decide to sell at the same time. So have an, uh, what's it called... exit strategy(?) and otherwise just HODL whatever you're comfortable HODL'ing. Go for a walk, clear your head, order something at Wendy's.

**TL;DR:** Calm down and keep a clear head. That's it.

So, how are you doing?
