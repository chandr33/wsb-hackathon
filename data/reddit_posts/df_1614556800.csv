Now that the yield bubble is popped and we are back into the stonks galore, I have been having some questionable dreams.

One of them occurred last night. In the deepest of sleeps, I was awoken my a gust of wind. I immediately opened my eyes and noticed that I was in a dream. Smooth sand around me and the smell of ocean. Perhaps in the south of France or maybe Greece? Either way, I noticed there was a beautiful lady next to me, a lady that you would all fall in love in seconds.

I began talking to this lady, her smile was very intoxicating. She came very close to me and as she was about to kiss me, she said Pump PLTR.

 I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

2019 revenues:  $49.8 million

2020 revenues: $75.2 million (est)

2021 revenues: $107.2 million (est)

2022 revenues: $174.7 million (est)

2023 revenues: $316.4 million (est)

2024 revenues: $581.4 million (est)

2025 revenues: $1,064.5 million (est)

 

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1) current product portfolio

2) product pipeline

3) existing retail distribution with more on the way

4) 1+ million existing customers

5) FDA clinical trials already underway

6) robust R&amp;D process

7) $300+ million on the balance sheet

8) strong brand awareness and NPS scores

9) strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]

10) seasoned management team

  **FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

&amp;#x200B;

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.

42,lw4lqp,"I'm no expert, but shouldn't any large changes to the supplemental leverage ratio be viewed as a negative catalyst for the stock market?

Risky Finance took note of this back in November, writing that regulatory capital had been decreased by as much as $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks due to the feds forbearance measures in response to the virus outbreak..

&gt;**“The biggest forbearance measure was a move by the Fed in May to exclude treasury bonds and** **central bank** **deposits from the leverage exposure measure. That wiped $2 trillion off the** **SLR** **denominator, including $619 billion at JP Morgan alone.""**  
**""Just one of the regulatory changes implemented by the fed in the response to the economic shutdowns would have reduced the denominator (total assets) for calculating the** **SLR** **by $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks (regulatory balance sheets)...""**  
**""...without three critical forbearance measures, some banks such as** **Citigroup** **or Goldman Sachs would have been just 30 basis points away from the minimum, which would prompted the Fed to restrict their trading and lending activity.”**  
[https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/](https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/)

To calculate the SLR , just divide the Tier 1 Capital by a bank’s assets.

**Tier 1 Capital = reserves, common equity, plus retained earnings and certain instruments with discretionary dividends and no maturity.**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp)

In the past, when the banking industry was much more competitive, it was common for banks to market themselves on their surplus (reserve) in order to attract new customers.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Changes to the leverage ratio can lead to very large increases--or decreases--to a banks’ ability to lend. To put that into perspective, according to Thomas Hoenig, a former Vice Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, if share buybacks of $83 billion, representing 72% of total payouts for the top 10 BHCs in 2017, were instead retained, under current capital rules, **this could have increased small business loans by $750 billion, or mortgage loans by almost $ 1.5 trillion...**

[https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed)

But how does this affect the stock market, you might be wondering?

Well, if J.P. Morgan is going to be adding roughly $619 billion back to the assets used for calculating this leverage ratio, it should theoretically reduce the amount of credit that will be available for investors to speculate. This, of course, would not be a good thing..

[Nick Panigirtzoglou](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;rlz=1C1NHXL_enCA704CA705&amp;oq=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), a top analyst at JPM, seemed to support this idea back in November when he argued that lockdowns could actually become a bullish signal because they would increase the likelihood of more quantitative easing from the fed.

&gt;**""Although it has had a negative impact in the short term, the reemergence of lockdowns and resultant growth weakness could bolster the above equity upside over the medium to longer term via inducing more QE and thus more liquidity creation.""**  
[https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/](https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/)

If a top analyst at America's largest bank believes that quantitative easing is more important to the stock market than real tangible business activity--even during worldwide pandemic related economic lockdowns--than it only makes sense to assume that any kind of drastic changes to the SLR should also have some kind of impact on equity markets as well.

**May 15, 2020,** **Federal Reserve** **Press Release**

&gt;""For purposes of reporting the supplementary leverage ratio as of June 30, 2020, an electing depository institution may reflect the exclusion of Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from total leverage exposure as if this interim final rule had been in effect for the entire second quarter of 2020. Because the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated as an average over the quarter, this will have the effect of maximizing the effect of the exclusion starting in the second quarter of 2020. The agencies are not making similar adjustments to riskbased capital ratios because Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks are risk-weighted at zero percent.""  
[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200515a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200515a1.pdf)

But again, I'm no expert, it's just with fed policy playing such an important role in market valuations these days, it's hard not to pay attention to what's going on.

Cheers, and hope to hear your thoughts.

I have been watching the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me.

How will shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.

1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.

2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. 

Well you heard of interstellar 🪀 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.

How does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. 

The theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud how do they do that? Well.. 

Most people are getting a $1400 check which they should be buying food and shit with hut are buying FDs and stonks. 

Effectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? 

You first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. 

Now how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.

Queue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. 

FOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. 

Considering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. 
If you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.

Im no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. 

Shitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.

Jdst, jnug, amd, vix, uvxy i have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.

Tl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? 

Gamestop, VXX, and puts.

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1. current product portfolio
2. product pipeline
3. existing retail distribution with more on the way
4. 1+ million existing customers
5. FDA clinical trials already underway
6. robust R&amp;D process
7. $300+ million on the balance sheet
8. strong brand awareness and NPS scores
9. strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]
10. seasoned management team

**FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.",$OWLT - Owlet Baby Care 'Connected Nursery Ecosystem' TO THE MOON via BECKY!,1.0,1614699179,pound_salt_

90,lw4qgb,"I'll keep it brief: 

* Estimated short interest @ 45%!
* Special dividend of $1.11 payable in 21 days, meaning shorts will have to cover $47million in div payments alone, compounded with a 53% margin rate to borrow shares. 
* There are only 400 shares @ Interactive Brokers left to borrow!
* The mortgage refi industry is going to rip into 2021 onwards with easy money policy, and RKT has excellent cash flow and price/book of 5! 
* ZERO insider selling in last 12 months, only BUYING @ $14.41million
* Even mainstream analysts have price target at $24.47, and they always have to be conservative.

If I were short I would be shitting my pants, this a setup that will send the stock to at least $60 by 21-march IMO.

 *Special Dividend*

* Our Company's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share payable on March 23, 2021 to holders of our Class A common stock of record at the close of business on March 9, 2021. During the year, we achieved significant growth and generated capital at a rate where we were able to fully re-invest in our business and have excess funds available to distribute to our shareholders. We will fund the special dividend from cash distributions of approximately $2.2 billion.
