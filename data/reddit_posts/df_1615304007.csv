Listen up apes, lets keep this short and sweet and we can go back to jerking it over the GME daily charts.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I like the stock. When GME hits $42,000.69, feel free to cash out and join me.
2. Short/gamma squeeze - I know you are sick of hearing this term but hear me out. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)

Look at this shit, I've no proof but it has Melvin Crapital and Shitadel written all over it. A good, great business being shorted out of its balls from its ATH of $14.38 to current price of $8.53 because hedgies hate good businesses.

4. Chance to join the Russell 1,000 and Russell 3,000 on 21 March

* UWMC has been added to *preliminary* Russell lists
* Stocks added to popular indices see their liquidity increase and a price bump because passive index funds and ETFs based on those indices are forced to acquire UWMC indirectly

91,m1945e,"Alright Apes, serious talk here. I’ve seen a lot of people throwing numbers around for what price GME will peak at. The truth is, there’s no way to know. I, however, believe that the price depends wholly on you. And me. And every smooth brained ape who bought a ticket for this crazy ass ride. 🦍🚀🚀🚀

The price depends on the strength of your dreams. I used to have to participate in these lame ice breaking conversations with new hire groups at work, and people would ask “what would your super power be if you could choose, and why?” The number of answers for mundane boring shit like being able to not sleep to get more done around the house, or to duplicate yourself so you could clean, work, and take care of the kids at the same time blew my mind.😴

 If you could choose your superpower for whatever you wanted, why not choose something badass, like flying, teleporting, super strength, stopping time? You could achieve all of your day to day mundane goals and SOOOOOO much more.
 
Now, I’m not some sort of financial expert. This isn’t advice; as they say, this is a casino and you've got to be responsible  for your own bets.. But this casino has a ton of Apes. Smooth brained, bold, retarded apes that have a common idea, to fuck the hedgies, to pay off student loans, pay for surgery to save their doggo, buy a new car, a new house, maybe even find a new girlfriend to distract your wife’s boyfriend so you can get some sleep in your own damn bed.
 
If the info about the number of shares borrowed vs. the number of shares that exist is correct, YOU get to choose your price. So do I. You need to take a look at what you’re willing to lose, and also what you want. I can't  tell you where this will peak,  or when you should sell. If you dream of making enough for a nice bottle of single malt and a 20 pc tendies, you do you. If you dream of Lambos and a epic method of telling your boss to go fuck him/herself as you quit your day job to drink margaritas on the beach all day, you need to target the price that allows for that. This is history in the making. There is no playbook for this. Similar things have happened in the past, but never to this degree.


Now, I’m not saying things can’t get derailed (queue Vlad’s douchey RH shenanigans from last time). We don’t know all the players in the game and what underhanded nasty moves they can pull to try to win.

BUT. You’ve got a chance to take this somewhere life changing for you. Even if you’ve only got one share, think of where you’d be if that jumps to $1k, $10k, $100k, $250k? I’m not saying it will hit those numbers, but I’m telling you to imagine what you’d do if it did. Make sure to take care of yourself, don’t risk more than you can afford to lose, but I’m dreaming BIG.
 
How strong is your dream? How diamond are those hands, really? 💎🖐🧐
