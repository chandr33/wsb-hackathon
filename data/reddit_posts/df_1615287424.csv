3,m143ns,"When I first started dabbling in investments I made a few silly moves, buying small cap biotechs on the recommendation of people who knew as little as I did about the technology, getting greedy and not selling after I made a decent profit only to see it tumble me back into the red. All in all I turned that $4k into about $1k pretty quickly. I may be a small time retard with a measly 13 GME shares at an average of about $100 but a few more days of these kind of gains and I'm going to be back in the green and it's all thanks to this mad community of apes.

I hold (10 GME around $138) and (29 AMC around $8.80) hoping to sell within 90-days to help my wife who was just diagnosed with ‘Long QT Syndrome.’ Her Grand Mal Seizures are getting worse and more frequent. 
She has lost some life-skills and her ability to work. I am praying for her as I liquidate what savings I have to manage our bills, rent, and care for my son.

Desperately seeking help. Watching my wife’s health deteriorate and losing my ability to sell my positions in GME and AMC in the next 90 days is killing me. I love her so much, and I am willing to do anything to help her.

2.  Get rid of your stupid sell orders at the meme price of 420 or 420.69.  Last time we hit a huge sell wall at this price that kept throwing us back down which slowed us  enough to buy them enough time to stop the momentum.  Think much bigger like your wife’s boyfriend’s dick.   

3. Don’t fuck your brothers or sisters.  Our Euro, Asian, and all other global family helped tremendously to drive pre market action all the way to $500 and we fucked them.  We must come back for them.   See picture in comments of that most glorious time.  

Don’t make the same mistakes.  Expect them to drive the price down but watch the volume.  Get rid of your ridiculously low sell orders.  Expect the unexpected and don’t get spooked.

60,m14fvs,"Hey guys, fellow lurker and beginner trader here. Finally wanted to make a post as I feel that I need to thank you guys~ 

Started out with $7,500 in late January from saved up money (basically all bank funds as a sub-middle class college student). First 10 days I made approx. $2,500 by random stocks I found on WSB. I couldn’t believe it. Of course I read a lot of material before buying in most of the time but I was still surprised.

But then here’s the interesting part. I decided with my 10 days of experience and handy dandy WSB encouragement to go all in on GME in early February. Time passed &amp; BOOM around -4,500 made with GME. I was baffled yetready for the consequences of my actions. My friends new about my endeavor as I had told them I was joining my fellow apes in the upcoming war. They laughed at me. They pointed. They laughed, stared at me, and pointed. All I had left were my fellow soldiers on WSB to hold me tight as I waited for GME’s return. 

Little did they know, **IM BACK BABY AND SO IS EVERYONE WHO HELD AND BELIEVED**. I’d like to personally thank everyone who has invested their time and money into GME. 👑 A crown to all of you.

75,m14i66,"Listen up retards, fellow eurotard here, this is my first post here, I‘ve been lurking for quite some time. I‘ll be throwing in some basic DD I‘ve just written while taking a long shit, I‘ve been somewhat constipated. 

*In the following there‘ll be a short and longer term outlook for the whole GME situation. I tried to include sources wherever I could but considering I‘m writing this on my phone it might not satisfy the boomer professors in here. All I have to say to you is - go google it if you have some doubts when it comes to the presented figures, retard.*

**Anyway here’s a short term outlook:**

EU pushed this to a high of 235 as of 10:11 UTC. As of now ~30‘000 Calls at a strike of 200 are in the money. If we keep this up we can easily get the 250.- strike too, that adds another ~14‘000 contracts for a realistic grand total of 44‘000 contracts or 4.4 million shares, that‘s close to 10% of the float.

Market makers will have to buy some of those shares on the open market in the course of this week - I’m aware they won’t be buying up the whole 10% of float as they probably already covered some of that in the past few weeks. 

Anyhow stay patient, put your limits on Alpha Centauri and DO NOT PAPERHAND AT OPEN for pennies - We have a lot further to go. If you‘re contracts are ITM exercise your options to help out with gamma - I suspect DFV and others might exercise early too as this is THE opportunity to create some huge buying pressure and fuck over Shitadel and Melvin once and for all - this week is a great opportunity to push this fucker out of the Milky Way. Markets also seem to be on the rise today so we have some tailwind.

**Now for a longer term outlook:**

Bear Thesis: 
1.) This shit is grossly overvalued and GME is a brick and mortar store with an out-of-date business concept. The current valuation stands at 13 billion USD - now Ryan Cohen‘s Chewy is valued at 40 billion USD and they sell fucking dog toys and catnip.
2.) Why order with GME when you can order at Amazon.

Bull Thesis: 
1.) Indexes such as the FTSE 1000 will be picking GME up as its valuation is in the double digit billions atm. This will cause a huge influx of capital into GME (iirc when Tesla was included in the S&amp;P500 TSLA went up by roughly 40%). Since the market is forward looking this might be priced in soon adding even more oil to the fire.
2.) Earnings will be announced around end of march and with the new Console Cycle and considering that GME had a highly seasonal revenue development (Best Quarter has always been Q4 - Christmas Shopping, holiday season and what not) and there‘s a shortage of chips —&gt; shortage of PS5‘s and Xboxes they‘re not discounting their merchandise for shit, so profitability should be high. Furthermore they closed quite a few physical locations in 2020 which was a good call considering Corona and all, this should further increase LT profitability as their moving to being more of an e-commerce business.
3.) GME is currently valued as a brick and mortar gaming store with a Price to Sales ratio of around 1.8. Take Amazon for example, they have a Sales to Price Ratio of 3.9 (I know that their biggest revenue segment is the whole AWS thing but the point is that if GME were to move into e-commerce and start developing digital products too, a comparison isn’t really blasphemy). Using those metrics ceteris paribus and assuming that GME could start selling exclusive digital products via partnerships with Nintendo, Steam, Microsoft (which is highly likely considering the recent developments on the board and management and RC’s Twitter activity) the valuation - purely based on Revenues could easily double and still be at fair value in the long run.
4.) Newly appointed board members and management will most likely be acquiring more shares, further reducing the float. The likelihood of GME issuing shares is small as a.) management will want to get some of those shares and b.) they already have a lot of debt and I personally think they already have enough capital for this turnaround. Also RC has a big dick (I‘d like to touch it after we moon).
5.) 13 Billion dollars might seem like a lot but it really isn‘t if you consider that there are companies like Palantir valued at 40B+ with negative EPS or TSLA with 540B+ and they just started becoming profitable recently. GME could re-purpose parts of their physical locations for fullfilment purposes, they have 5500 stores in the US alone and some more in the EU. Now that’s some infrastructure and considering that RC is somehwat of an e-commerce pro I trust in his abilities to make the best use of those physical locations. Also GME will be a more gamer-centric business as Amazon and the likes as RC values the customer experience highly as demonstrated with Chewy - in short, I‘m not doubting for a second that RC will make this the most attractive shopping venue (online and offline) for gamers, the guy‘s a fucking beast.

TLDR: We‘re going to the moon - Keep buying and holding. Don’t be a paperhanded bitch - you might get some affection from your wife if you’re a good boy. 400 gang, we‘re coming to pick you up. 🍌🍌🍌🦍🦍🦍
