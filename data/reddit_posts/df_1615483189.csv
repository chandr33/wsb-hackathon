If I filter by flair to DD and sort by new(which is a lot of effort), one can find good DDs, but you have to painfully click every single one of them as their are probably some users who actively downvote any other infos other than a specific ticker.

I used to use this sub to understand retail sentiment and to look forward to good DDs by other users that were genuinely informative and also genuine counter arguments to the DD. I also used to lurk here in it when I first started using reddit. Also, the jokes by users used to be funnier and innovative.

Luckily, there are other avenues to gauge retail sentiment and to find good market research(being an elitist, I won't mention there name here) but it's just sad to think how far it has...

Anyway, being an optimist, I hope this whole situation will normalise and counter DD commenters will return and good DD will also have its day in the front page.

I check these everyday and throughout the whole week for all my plays. I had not seen anywhere near that many puts these last couple weeks. And of course that day we saw what happened. I wish I would have checked what the heatmap looked like on AMC and other stocks we saw take a massive dip. To see if this was all a master plan by some whales.

Regardless we can expect today to be a good day for GME. Keep HOLDING. Any other insight would be very much appreciated.

Some people say that‚Äôs the equivalent of licensing iOS or MacOS to third party companies and such collaboration would never be allowed at Apple. 

My theory is the second one, because Apple doesn‚Äôt even own their iPhone factories, they just delegate manufacturing to Foxxcon and Pegatron. Apple stock is generally seen as a good investment, with or without an actual car. To support the collaboration theory, look at the Apple TV: at some point people speculated Apple was building an actual Smart TV to compete against LG or Samsung, but ended up making a tv box instead

Also, the theory only says Apple may release a car ‚Äúone day in the future‚Äù, and probably ‚Äúnear the year 2030‚Äù, which is a bogus claim because everyone can say a company MAY or may not release anything in 10-15 years.
