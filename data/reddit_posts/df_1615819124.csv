2,m5m3hw,"50% losses for stocks this past month is a big correction. 

Stocks don’t normally lose 50% of their value but we’re chugging along kinda just pretending it didn’t happen I’ll be honest. 

For example I’m sure you can look at the Great Depression as a correction too. 

2008 was a correction. 

I’m ready for another in-correction because that’s the only way an ape like me make money. Banana, no cramp. I’m a monkey. I need my banana.

Just a huge market correction where everything went on sale and some people lost everything...but it was more likely that every person lost something. 

These days we will always be able
to find a stock that’s hot and losing $11,000 in a day is just a normal Tuesday to me so when it happens to everyone, makes me feel better.

34,m5m790,"Good morning fellow apes.  Last week I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2oxn9/the_delevering_of_citadel_and_melvin_capital_via/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) post sharing details on Melvin Capital's long position in Expedia, and the impact a de-levering even would have on $EXPE.

If we take Gabe Plotkin's congressional testimony as fact, Melvin capital still has an open short position in GME.  As GME price continues to rise, Melvin will need to de-lever its portfolio, the largest exposure of which is $EXPE.  If WSB were to begin shorting EXPE, Melvin and other institutional holders would be forced to reduce their portfolio exposure.  

The continued short squeeze of GME, compounded by EXPE shorting would collapse the price of EXPE in the short term, forcing Melvin Capital to quickly sell off their EXPE holdings.  As WSB takes notice of this portfolio exposure, other institutional investors will likely dump EXPE as well to avoid a domino drop of their own holdings.

39,m5m8kg,"In my quest to outretard the rest of you, I’m always looking for the next big thing, and after doing my own DD, I’m convinced SKT is the next one to lift off.

The skinny:  To summarize,  SKT is an REIT specializing in outlet mall space.  it has very high short interest (~40%%) with a relatively low number of shares outstanding (~90M).  One of the biggest short holders is our old pal, Melvin Capital.  Essentially SKT is GME's Downie brother who has been squirreled away to the back room to wonder why no one is paying him any attention.  Let's give him some.

The thesis of those holding short positions is that retail is dying, and that the ‘Rona was going to hasten its death.   That seemed like a reasonable hypothesis early on in the pandemic- but that hypothesis has collapsed, yet they haven't closed their shorts.

Early on in the pandemic, a TON of stores closed down.  In April of last year, only 1% of stores that had shut down had reopened (as a percentage of occupied stores).  By June 3, 56% had reopened, and by Jan 31, 99% had.  

In the Q4 last year, they were able to collect 95% of their usual payments.  Their recovery has been amazing, and we’re only just now starting to see people start to return to less cautious lifestyles.   The fact that they are outdoor outlets helps that proposition.

SKT certainly faces some headwinds- it’s in a challenging business during a challenging time, much like our friends at GME.  But it’s not in such a terrible position to warrant 40% short interest.  A week or so we gave it a little squeeze, a gentle caress really, and it gave some ground.  It seems like if we were to reach around and use both hands this time,  with one firmly gripping the gamma, we’d really see it fly.  A $200 target has been thrown around here on WSB; I feel like trying to put a certain number on it is just guesswork, but I do feel like there is room for this to jump.  

So, you like beaten down retail plays with high short interest?  Why not get in on the ground floor and buy the whole fookin’ mall?  $$SKT$$SKT

88,m5mhpe,"Please let me know whether you agree with my long thesis on Revlon ($REV).  I have a small long position, and I’m considering buying more.  I’m bullish because of the potential in the short term for a short squeeze.  I'm also bullish because, as the economy reopens, beauty and cosmetics will do better, which gives $REV time to orchestrate a sale of either all or a portion of the business to address long term debt.    

SHORT SQUEEZE 

I’m not long on $REV just to take part in a short squeeze, but the potential is there.  $REV has a high short interest at 26%.  Their market cap is only about $650 million.  Short interest ratio is 4.4.  86% of the equity is owned by billionaire Ronald Perelman, whose daughter is the CEO of $REV.  The large short interest is partly a result of debt maturities that were scheduled to come due this year, but as $REV announced during their earnings call last week (and in their 10-k), they have successfully refinanced and restructured their debt obligations such that there are no debt maturities this year and they believe they have sufficient liquidity at this time.   

RISKS 

Even though $REV no longer has debt maturing this year, they still have a large amount of long term debt ($3.4 billion) which will come due between 2023 and 2025.  Their interest expense in 2020 was $243.3 million.  Per their 10-k, as of December 31, 2020, they had a liquidity position of $249.9 million, including: (i) $97.1 million of cash, and (ii) $168.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The debt of $REV needs to be addressed through asset sales and cash from operations.  

ASSET SALES 

In December of 2020, $REV sold licensing rights to Helen of Troy for certain hair and grooming products in exchange for $72 million, which was a very positive development. It can be expected that $REV will continue to seek sales of either portions of their business (such as American Crew, which is potentially worth hundreds of millions) or even the entire business.  I won't mention who the potential acquirers are or the multiples, since that is all speculation, but that can be googled.    

REBOUNDING SALES 

While $REV suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic, their sales have been steadily rebounding since. In Q2 of 2020, their net sales declined 39% versus the prior year.  In Q3 of 2020, their net sales declined by 20% relative to the prior year. In Q4 of 2020, the decline was just 10% relative to the prior year.  With the economy reopening, vaccine pace improving, and stimulus checks flowing, it should be expected that $REV will continue to have improved sales in 2021.  Going forward, $REV can benefit from improving their e-commerce and social media channels as well as their sales in China, all of which show signs of promise.  

CONCLUSION 

$REV has risks, but I’m long on it because the reward can be substantial.  In particular, the risk in the short term seems low because the equity value will be supported by the possibility of short squeezes, an improving macro environment for $REV’s sales, the possibility of positive news on asset sales, and the elimination of concerns about the liquidity of $REV in the short term.  Please provide honest feedback as to whether you agree on my thesis.  Thanks. ",Revlon – the next meme stock?,1.0,1615820270,MrMooola
