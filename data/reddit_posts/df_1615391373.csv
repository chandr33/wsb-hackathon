Listen up, this is going to be a fairly long series of DDs but I'm including lots of pictures so you don't get too distracted by my words. Before u/DeepFuckingValue was even born, a true autist by the name of Dr. Michael Burry was probably starting medical school. HE IS THE TRUE AUTIST and finder of ridiculous market inefficiencies when it comes to investing his hedge fund's money. The dude shorted the entire AMERICAN HOUSING MARKET and made billions...who the heck comes up with crap like that? He then saw the short interest in GME and knew this shit would happen before ANYONE ELSE.

9.1% of his entire fucking fund went to CALLS ON KETCHUP AND SLICED AMERICAN CHEESE. This dude manages $386 MILLION dollars and he fucking bought CALLS ON KETCHUP. What the actual fuck? That comes out to $35 MILLION dollars in CALLS ON KETCHUP. I want to reiterate, something, KETCHUP???

So maybe autists like ketchup, but guess who else fucking LOVES ketchup:

The greatest investor of all time likes ketchup, that's who. And fuck, who the hell started using the word CATSUP by the way, that shit needs to stop. But back to Warren Buffett, the founder of Berkshire Hathaway. He owns 27% of KHC, thats 325 MILLION SHARES. 

So we got the Godfather of GME with $35 Million in calls, Warren Buffet with $12 Billion dollars in shares, WHAT GIVES? Why is these dudes buying KHC?

**GlobeNewswire**

10:13 AM ET

EVmo, Inc, formerly YayYo, Inc (""EVmo"" or the ""Company"") (OTC:YAYO), a leading provider of vehicles to the rideshare and delivery gig economy industry, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rideshare Car Rentals, LLC, today announced that it is partaking in a fleet acquisition of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles, and has committed to go all electric by year end of 2021.  


Steven Sanchez, CEO of EVmo said, ""The future of mobility is electric. Tesla is an obvious choice and we are excited to be one of the first Tesla rideshare fleet partners in the US that will deploy electric vehicles rather than gasoline-powered vehicles, for services like Uber and Lyft. Our EV commitment provides outsized climate benefits. The explosive growth in the gig economy and evidence that it's cann ibalizing more climate-friendly mass transit makes it important for EVmo to go all electric. There are a small number of electric vehicles used by drivers, yet electric vehicle adoption is on the rise. We recognize that the timing is right to go electric. The environmental and emission reduction benefits are high for electric vehicle usage by gig economy drivers and we want to be a catalyst for that transition.""  


In recent press, rideshare companies and carmakers are increasing the number of electric vehicles used in the transportation industry. Both Uber and Lyft announced they are going 100% electric vehicles on their platform. General Motors plans to completely phase out vehicles using internal combustion engines by 2035, More than half of GM's capital spending and product development team wil l be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs. Ford, VW and Volvo are making a serious play in electric as well. But it's Tesla that is the unparalleled EV market leader in the world that makes the product such an excellent strategic choice.  


Further, Mr. Sanchez stated, ""We are confident our all electric fleet will drive a successful business model for the future, becoming the first to exclusively deploy electric vehicles (EVs) for the gig economy will position us as a leader in the space and is a natural evolution from our mixed energy fleet. As previously announced, the company deployed 40 electric vehicles (EVs) in December of 2020, as part of a car-sharing program in LA. Since then, we acquired 12 EV's in February of 2021, and discovered there was a strong demand for them . We were encouraged that they rented quickly. Drivers have given great reviews, and are finding the charging easy. Not only did they save money on gas, which is their biggest cost, they received an additional $0.50 directly from a $1.00 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed. Drivers also found that there was sufficient range and ample charging stations in the LA market where the vehicles were launched. And most importantly, it did not limit the number of rides or deliveries. To diversify our EV fleet, we tested the market with Hyundai Kona Electric units, which offers solid tech and safety features at only $10 more a day for drivers, it more than covered the gas savings."" Sanchez continued, ""By EVmo's acquisition and deployment of electric vehicles, drivers did not have higher up-front costs compared to them having to purchase EV's. We have 10 Tesla Model 3's and more Hyundai Kona's being delivered in the next few weeks and there are plans to establish our EV fleet f urther through the ordering of more Tesla Model 3's. We plan on using future funding and resources in a way that supports our EV future plans.  


Sanchez continued, ""The Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus is highest rated in every category. It offers Tesla prestige at a lower price, is most technologically advanced and is best in class on range, performance and handling. Equally important is the Tesla supercharger network access. With a range at 263 miles, Tesla Model 3 makes it affordable and profitable for both the driver and us. The drivers get the benefits of the gas savings; plus, they can drive at a higher level both Uber and Lyft's platform, where they can earn more money.""  
EVmo, Inc. (formerly YayYo, Inc.)  


EVmo, Inc. bridges the gap between rideshare drivers in need of a suitable vehicle and rideshare companies that depend on attracting and keeping drivers.

About Tesla  


Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric - that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.  


Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world's first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up - Model S - which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world's expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk's ""Secret Master Plan,"" in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever - Tesla Semi - which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.  
Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla's safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.  


To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla's automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 - a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.  


And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy prod uction. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful - that's the future we want.
