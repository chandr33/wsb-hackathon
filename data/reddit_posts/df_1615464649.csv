**Our retarded efforts are now becoming part of established financial theory, my fellow autists.**

LINK: [FORBES](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=73bfa7ae4225)

""I have come to see that there is enormous leverage inherent in two new factors, which are interrelated: 

* the use of call options to drive quasi-forced buying – the “Gamma” formula means that each dollar spent on buying an option can under the right circumstances drive 10 or 20 or 50 dollars of share purchases through the hedging operations of the option-sellers 
* the “swarm” factor – the old market networks operated (legally or otherwise) with perhaps a few dozens of participants; the Reddit’s [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) is said to have **9.4 million members.** If even a fraction of them coordinate their efforts, **they can overrun the market**

This leverage has changed the game. It will be “interesting” to watch as traders probe the market with **this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have.**

\[I have not tried to formally quantify this leverage. But consider an example – with data that is time-stamped at the close of the market on Tuesday, March 9. Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12. The March 9 cost of the option is $24. *If* all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices. 

*Would* they hedge? GME closed March 9 at $246. It was up $118 in the previous 3 days. If it ran another $100 in the following 3 days, each option seller would lose $52 on each option. I suspect they would consider hedging.""",FORBES: (WSB) I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have,1.0,1615464891,DreadViking1
16,m2osta,"I was in a dark place in early January. The company where I had been working for the past 12 years decided to do a “strategic restructure” at the end of last year, and I lost my job right before Christmas. 

On top of that, right around New Year’s I got into a accident. I made a full recovery (at least physically), but, because I lost my health benefits just a couple of weeks prior, I was left with a devastating hospital bill. 

I only had $3000 in my bank account with no new income coming in. I wasn’t sure how much longer I would be able to pay my rent for and faced the very real possibility of having to live out of my car for awhile. I became more and more desperate, so I spent entire days from morning to night spamming my resume to every company I came across on LinkedIn and researching ways to make money quickly. It was during this time that I discovered this subreddit — I’m sure you can see where this is heading. 

FOMO is hell of a drug. With the GME hype in full force, I decided to go with the equivalent of a fourth quarter Hail Mary. I set aside $500 for food and in case of emergencies and then threw the remaining $2500 entirely into the stock. I knew I only had a few days before I needed to pay rent for the next month, so the date when I made this do-or-die decision was deeply imprinted into my mind — January 27th. 

I didn’t buy exactly at the top of the peak, but I was close enough to it. I haven’t told anyone this (not even my family), but on February 1st, the day the stock plummeted and closed at $90, I cried for the first time in 20 years. 

By the time the stock bottomed out around $40, there were days when I seriously questioned whether life was worth continuing to live. Joy felt more and more like a distant memory and I started battling with serious bouts of depression, but thankfully there were two things that greatly helped me get through this period. 

The first was the kindness of people around me — my buddy who let me crash on his couch, the owner of a local restaurant who would save leftovers for me so that I didn’t have to make the choice between spending money or going hungry the next day, an ex-colleague who set me up with a job interview. I cannot properly express the level of gratitude that I feel for these people. For them, it might have just been a simple act of generosity, but for me it made a world of difference. 

The second was this community. Even though you are all retards, you convinced me that there was no point in selling at 15% of the price I bought in at. I definitely could have used those $200-300 to help me through those rough times, but you inspired me to HODL throughout the so-short-but-so-long month of February. It was truly Lambo or food stamps, and unfortunately it looked like the food stamps were going to win. 

Then it all changed. I started a new job last Monday with a 30% pay increase over what I was getting before. Apparently, the longer you work at a company, the longer they can get away with underpaying you. And then yesterday, even after all the short attacks, it finally happened — the stock closed just above the price I had paid back in January. 

Things are looking up and now that I’m “safe,” have I learned my lesson? Hell no! I want Melvin and Citadel to pay for what they’ve done, not just to me but to all of the people out there whose livelihoods they’ve destroyed and whose dreams they’ve crushed with their shady underhanded tactics. 

They’ve been playing by their own rules for too long, and now that we are finally beating them at their own game, they are shaking in their boots. We have them on the ropes now, boys. Don’t succumb to the FUD now! 

WE AIN’T SELLING UNTIL WE GET TO THE MOON 💎🤲🚀💎🤲🚀💎🤲🚀

Last but certainly not least, if there is anything to take away from my story at all, it should be to never put in more money than you can afford to lose.

Someone made a shit ton of money from the drop.

So as most of you know a good deal of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying rolling forward as the price climbs, and subsequent MM delta hedging.

Someone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock. They then sold their puts off at the bottom. As you can see the put volume spikes are identical.

Position: shares and calls in $GME

**TLDR:** watch out for put volume spikes at the bottom of run ups if you took a loan out from your wife's boyfriend to buy $GME.

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.  

https://preview.redd.it/uxctj2oi2em61.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=378c368c44c2dc85abff6ba29ba59697ca6f3176

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",The De-levering of Citadel and Melvin Capital via $EXPE,1.0,1615465418,watchthegaps

I didn't know anything two months back in investment and couldn't really afford anything because my family was in debt. Then my father made an accident with his car (my father is okay but the car...) therefore creating another huge debt, doubling it.

Despite all this I still watched carefully what was happening with GME and people here. I just saw (and still see) madness and complete nonsense. Void instead of brains and colors instead of blood. Then I suddenly felt lighter. So strange. I was looking at myself and noted that something was amiss but couldn't put a finger on it. My head is so light! Not normal. But right after I decided that I could totally trust GME and retard people believing in the stock as believing in a cult.
One share with my scholarship at first then when it was so bright green my parents were convinced and decided to give up to pay the debt for now and just give me money instead. Then again more green. Then food money for next week for more green. Green again.

Yesterday however I saw a strange color. Same as blood and thought that was a very very big discount! I mean when there are discounts, they're written in that color! These bloody sellers always knew how to do business! A discount when I already had nothing more! What misery was this? But I was still lucky and had a friend who I introduced to all of this a few days ago. He could buy one more for me. Thanks friend!

Then it was turned green again! So close to not have been able to buy the discount. However all of this green was making my head spin and drool. This color seemed delicious and appealing. It was so familiar but I couldn't find why.
Green is the color of nature, nature that created life! Life brought apes then humans then apes again. To survive they had to eat living stuff hence... green things! The answer was close I smelled it! They ate green plants with other green stuffs that sometime were little sticks and ultimately they were satiated. Ho yeah! the dessert right! When the body is satiated it produces green stuffs in the nose that you could eat again for free! That was what smelt familiar! I just ate a whole bunch this week without noticing it! Maybe that was why I felt so light! I lost like 3 pounds since. 

All of this for just saying thank you for opening my eyes that I was truly a retard. Gamble with government money; check. Gamble with debt; check. Gamble with food money; check. Borrow money from a friend; check. Not selling when it hit 330$ and I abolutely knew it was going to dip again like two months ago; check.

My only regret is not having more money for GME. I never understood that better than now that money calls more money.

So yeah let me repeat this. This subreddit is so fcking terrifying and disgusting for the HFs and a really good washing for brains. Mine is so smoothly shiny now. (I would send a picture as soon as I find it again)

This only works obviously if there’s no fee to place money into a stock and take the money out. 

It just feels like an incredibly stupid zero capital risk plan that could either result in your stop loss triggering stopping any loss, or it results in cash.

Let me give an example,
You put $1000 at ten times leverage into a risky tech spec stock, you do this ten times and keep repeating as stop loss is triggered or you can take profit, let’s say over the course of a year you do this for 250 companies and 10 of them rocket up 400%, you make $400000 minus tax. BOOM profit.

🚀  Roblox is widely viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of COVID-19 as lock-down orders, school shut-downs, and parents dealing with their young children 7 days a week permeated the world. The data supports this as Daily Active Users (DAU) doubled on a YoY basis in a short timeframe. Roblox provides 3D virtual world experiences to over 36M DAUs.
During the pandemic, growth exploded and ~75% of children aged 9 to 12 use the platform. To continue its growth, Roblox is adding events to capture additional users and hours spent on the platform.


🚀


🚀🚀 One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.


🚀


🚀🚀🚀  Roblox isn't your traditional developer or publisher of video games nor is it a video gaming company as the business model combines gaming and social. Roblox fits the Andreessen Horowitz model as it can be free and it's widely available across gaming consoles, PCs, and even mobile (iOS and Android) and, more importantly, friends can play together across different platforms. From a business model sense, Roblox is a platform company that has a network effect, the more users who engage with the platform will, in turn, invite their friends. From a ""social"" point of view, Roblox users spend 2.5X more time on Roblox than YouTube. 


 🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀 On the other side of the platform are developers who create ""experiences"" (or games) for the players and, in 2019, developers created over 20M experiences. The key, however, is that Roblox provides the tools for developers to create a game and, more importantly, as players get older, some develop games on Roblox. Monetization occurs when some users buy Robux to pay developers for an experience or virtual items for their avatar. In essence, there are two self-reinforcing network effects occurring where more players will invite their friends who will become players and more players on Roblox will create more developers to create additional content..


🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 In some ways, the business model is similar to eBay's (EBAY) business model as eBay created a platform to connect sellers with buyers and sellers pay eBay to list their goods. The difference with Roblox is that not all players buy Robux and, rather than Roblox taking 100% of Robux's sales, Roblox takes a percentage of Robux sales as its fee. However, do not be fooled that Roblox may take only a ""small fee"" as it is estimated that the fees that Roblox charge its developers are in excess of 70% (Adopt Me!: The most popular game you've never played) and while Roblox may take at least 70%, for those who purchase Robux via the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, fees to those platforms, i.e. Google and Apple, are 30%.
