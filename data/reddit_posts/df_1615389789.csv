1,m1zwgm,"Fellow ape here, So last night i noticed i was getting a weird message when i tried to transfer funds from my bank into fidelity “you dont currently have accounts that can receive this transfer”. Called up Fidelity only to have them say that for no reason my account was terminated and i could only liquidate. Im pretty sure they moved my settled funds to my bank but I can’t see yet. Does it usually take a couple days? I just did the transfer over to webull so I’m hoping i see those transferred soon. The operator said he’d never seen this before. Like what the fuck? Is it because i was trading Gme and Amc? I thought they’d be a trustworthy company to deal with. They’re worse than robbing hood to me at this point. At least robinhood said you could still have an account and trade. Like this makes zero sense?

40,m1zz56,"To give some context very quickly, I use an algorithm to track chatter and rate the sentiment of stocks discussed on different social media platforms. I use this to try and identify new stocks, or good investment opportunities.

The majority identified are very volatile or pump n dump schemes, hence why I do qualitative research and write-ups on a very select number of stocks.

APPLE Inc. 🍎 (AAPL) +38% in mentions

Market Cap: $1.95 Trillion

I will save the introduction into this company as i’m sure all of you are aware of who Apple are.

Instead, I will cover why this is a good time to look at apple stock and what their future holds.

Timing

At the start of this year, Apple stock was at $145 a share. It is currently down \~20% from that price, mostly due to the tech slump of the last few weeks.

It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t a company with a crazy valuation due to projected future earnings, it’s already an absolute cash cow with solid current earnings, which makes this a safer investment than some of the more speculative tech plays.

Furthermore, this all time high price is one I feel will be surpassed in the future, given the future plans I will discuss below.

Future

Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans interact and work with computers. While not always at the forefront of the innovation curve, The company has been able to revolutionise and disrupt sectors with their products.

The reason this has been so tremendously successful for Apple, for so long, is the seamless integration between their products, the ‘ecosystem’, which means that in a world of continuously more sophisticated technology, Apple’s devices work and integrate seamlessly with each other, creating a highly rewarding customer experience.

This allows Apple to enter, or even create new markets *(think iPad or AirPods)* with a higher-than-usual success rate, while also being able to charge a higher premium for the Apple experience.

This higher success rate, along with big technology developments in the personal device space is the reason why I think Apple will sustain their position as a leading technology company.

**Augmented Reality**

Next up for Apple? mixed and augmented reality (MR and AR).

Augmented reality is the idea of overlaying projected imagery, graphics or instructions onto the real-world. Instagram face filters are an entertaining example of that, Mercedes’ current Sat Nav systems are a more useful use-case.

Apple are heavily investing into AR technology, with rumours of them releasing AR focussed glasses between later this year and 2022, future plans also suggest a 3 stage release of AR technology, starting with AR helmets and going all the way to contact lenses by 2030 *(this technology is closer than you think, look at this company who have working examples*[ *https://www.mojo.vision/*](https://www.mojo.vision/)*).*

**Apple car**

Slightly less sci-fi than AR, Apple has been working on a car since 2014, looking to release an autonomous driving model at around 2024.

I won’t go into too much detail here on this as there is already tons of content online to read through, but a successful car launch can provide another massive revenue stream for Apple to grow even further.

**Summary**

Strong future outlook, solid established earnings, a loyal consumer and a reduced current price make buying the world’s most popular stock a very interesting prospect.

While to some, the idea of AR glasses or an Apple car could sound like a gimmick, or yet another product that has cool technology but no uptake *(3D TVs anyone?),* try to think back to what you first thought of the iPad announcement, or the Apple watch. Both to me were products that seemed to have little use, but I was clearly proven wrong!",Good time to buy AAPL?,1.0,1615389985,akokaz1
