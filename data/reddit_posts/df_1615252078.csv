Today's Fintel data shows that CYDY has 0 (yes zero now! - note that it was 10M about a week ago) shares available to short! Short volume ratio 64.24 today (plus 64.98, 69.4, 55.32, 27.41 in last four trade days). So CYDY has been way over shorted. Price has been solely driven down by short sells - way over sold (by shorts)! Longs should hold your shares with diamond hands. When any piece of good news comes in in the near future, CYCY will skyrocket to Moon - it will be driven by news and, more significantly, by short squeeze! Folds up if not more than that.
