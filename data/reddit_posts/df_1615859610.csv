2. Largest wholesale mortgage lender in America
3. They use and own their own proprietary software and system. They're the quickest at approving and closing loans in the market and hold this as a key competitive differentiator over their competitors.
4. They benefit both B2C and B2B.
5. They've grown %545 this year alone with earnings forecasted to grow %4.83 per year. Market Cap: 16.58B.
6. They're also heavily undervalued. Currently going for around the $8 price range; The fair value analysis is between $19.34 - $40.00. Source: SimplyWallStreet. [Here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings).
7. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.
8. Short interest is very high. Over the last 2 weeks, the short interest volume % has been between 28% - 31%. The latest short interest information from general market analysis companies are dated as of 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock had a dividend payout on 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82 (The shorts must cover that as well), so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC. Source: Fintel. [Here](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc).
9. Major market analyst rate $UWMC as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.
10. This is both a good short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to reach it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride. Plus, it has a dividend of %4.82, or $0.10 per share quarterly. I'm not a big fan of dividends, but I know a lot of investors are.

26,m5ydij,"Other than the SEC getting involved and having a hearing. However, this is a fucking joke considering such an action would set precedent for all other publicly traded securities and funds, the only recompense HF's can expect, in any form of significance, is to have another senatorial hearing which then MIGHT result in a  SEC recommendation getting involved and/or the treasury, FTC, US ATG/Justice Department (in regards to hearings on the legality of such retail investing, it's regulations and respective suggestions on how to amend current policies concerning the practice.)

But we're talking the government here. The bureaucratic process. Nonetheless it is a blue house and senate, but if we're talking legislation on their end it could take them literally months to pass anything on it, just look at the stimulus package and their numerous reassurances that it would be released a week after Biden's inauguration. 2 months, but hey, it's only 8 times longer than what they said it would take. (/s)

That's if the SEC doesn't get a recommendation, and although it is highly unlikely that they won't, if they did it might take equally as long to address the situation as any change in policy or commissioner's intervention would have equally monumental effects on the markets overall. Not to mention the ethical arguments of governmental control in a free market system isn't exactly laissez faire.

The only other ""controls"" I can think of that would affect GME and the other shorted stocks are either economic collapses or the power grids failing. Or if Citadel/Melvin/others sell their short positions, but I'm not privy to that knowledge or the potential ramifications those actions could illicit.

My theory is that they are deliberately doing these attacks to get GME on the SSR the next day in order to prevent massive movements going in the positive direction. Then when GME is off of the SSR, the SHITs do the same attack again repeating the process to prevent as many losses as possible and to to bring the price down with a shitty strategy of theirs.  

Steps:
1. The price is doing all good and then the attack comes plummeting the price more than 10%. 

2. The next day, GME is on the SSR; and the stock is relatively flat on this day. 
- Being on the SSR prevents massive swings in the stock, if I understand it correctly. 

3. The third day, GME is off of the SSR and the attack happens again driving the price down even further. 
- The price will go down -&gt; be flat; or increase slightly -&gt; then go down again... leading the price, on average in the downward direction.

81,m5ym4a,"So I was surfing the 3/19 option chain for GME Friday mid-day when 3/12's were about to expire and noticed some sizable volume well over open interest in the 195 and 200 puts.  (I later saw some lesser volume higher at 230 put strike.)  Obviously were some new contracts getting written at the 195 level.

[3\/12\/2021 about mid day in 3\/19 contracts \(Open Int. far right, Volume 2nd from right\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqwutaavkan61.jpg?width=1369&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b2dc9bef6439fcf5cddba083bcde66065402f7)

So I Youtubed bearish put straddles Friday night and mused the aim was to write the contracts for the funding to push the price down to the 230 range the next week.  Not to the levels of the price on the contracts of 195-200.

So I wasn't appalled this morning on coffee break when I saw the big drop.  Here's a snapshot of the option prices after the drop.  Think they made a killing on the option? Nope!  Delta ate into the price since 3/19 contracts are now prime time for the buzzer Friday 4pm.

[3\/15\/2021 \(3\/19 contract chain\) post drop 10:30 CDT ](https://preview.redd.it/grzf93o5oan61.jpg?width=1369&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c880d10abebcd74199ab0f029bc32e6bf975a276)

The drop gained some cred and psych for the put peddlers.  Looks like more volume at the 200 strike.  See the open interest much higher as a result of the Friday put writing at 195-200. 

At the close I snapshotted and highlighted some observations.

[3\/15\/2021 close \(3\/19 GME chain\)](https://preview.redd.it/miiufbvkpan61.jpg?width=1380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdddaffe1c968aa9e1d8bdb84e4c8b2d69bad1b1)

Looks like a lot of the big volume was in and out of other strikes, but the action is 2 to 3 times higher than open interest in the (Out-of-the-Money) OTM Puts (ovaled in green).  Still, the price of the 200 put (in red) is at the Friday prices, for now, due to the ticking expiration or Delta. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Lace up Diamond Hands.  Action is not on the B-Ball courts Friday.  Looks like heavy money in the 200 and below puts.  I am not leaving!! 💎🤲 HODL HODL HODL 🍌🍌🍌

Idc if hfs and MM see this post. They cant stop RKT. Check it. Let me know if I’m missing something.

All this talk about buying ITM options on GME made me realize this potential for RKT. It just clicked.

1. TDA and Schwab place short restrictions on RKT as of market close last Friday. (Hint hint)
2. Finra shows short interest at 34.45%

1. It’s in an uptrend look at how close we are to pushing 50k of 28.89s open interest contracts this week into the money.
2. RKT is on an uptrend and support is moving up above 26. As it moves up you WILL see volume. You WILL see wales put buying pressure. The last RKT move was a short squeeze, this will be a gamma squeeze and short squeeze.

Open interest is 50k on 28.89s this week. If this gets ITM market makers will buy shares to cover. Guess what??? Once they buy those shares..the price will put 33.89s ITM. Then MM have to buy more shares....Guess what?!! There is another 15k of open interest contracts at 38.89!! Guess what? There is another 22k of open interest at 48.89s!

&amp;#x200B;

Yes there is more! Shorts will piss their pants so it will not only gamma squeeze but also short squeeze at the same damn time. This is not a stock you want to fuck with.

Ok one last time it gets better. New options will open up and retail will start buying in late as always. While shorts cover these higher options at 60-70 will start getting ITM too. MM will have to buy more shares to cover.

Don’t limit the possibility of this. Look at the facts.

Wait...There is a possibility of more. Say shorts start shorting it at $60 -$70 a share. They hammer it down. Then Dan and Jay think mhmm..we should initiate 1 billion dollar buy back at this good price of $40 a share. They get squeezed again and more contracts are itm. This could moon January GME style.

95,m5yp1u,"We're apes! We're reckless, arrogant, stupid apes. And Robinhood are pussies. And Melvin/Citidel are assholes. Pussies don't like apes, because pussies get fucked by apes. But apes also fuck assholes — assholes who just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with apes is that sometimes they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate — and it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes, pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves... because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes. I don't know much in this crazy, crazy world, but I do know that if you don't let us fuck this asshole, we're going to have our apes and pussies all covered in shit!

98,m5yqek,"During januarys attempt , I must admit that I was scared to lose my money when I saw the huge dips in the stonks we like. I dont come from a rich family to gamble away hard earned money so easily. So I admit it was very stressful, also watching it stay red and having losses wasnt very pleasant to see. Sometimes I was thinking, well, its over I guess. Maybe I should just sell it and try my luck elsewhere... But my ape instinct suddenly awoke inside me. I pounded on my chest, releasing weird battlenoises. And I told myself. IM NOT FUCKIN SELLIN! I ate some bananas and followed many DDs you guys made also made some of my own ape minded mind. That now when I see this gme going red, and deep, Im like: LMAO IS THIS ALL? I kinda found peace with the dip, because if it just dips further, I just buy more! And what usually happens, it goes a little bit back into green and flatlines and makes my day boring as fuck. But hey, this is not forever. And I know it, we know it. Eventually soon the stock will be very errected green. Im happy to be part of this journey even if I have just a few shares. And I hope we will turn the world to a better place. 


no, im not fuckin financially advising here. ugha ugha
