Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), charge brokerage firms a small fee for sell orders in the US. With some exceptions, Robinhood passes these fees to its customers and remits these fees to the applicable SROs.

* Regulatory Trading Fee: $22.10 per $1,000,000 of principal (sells only). This fee is rounded up to the nearest penny. Robinhood Financial will not pass these fees on to its customers for sales with a notional value of $500 or less.
* FINRA Trading Activity Fee: 0.000119 per share (equity sells only) and $0.002 per contract (options sells).This fee is rounded up to the nearest penny and no greater than $5.95. Robinhood Financial will not pass these fees to its customers for sales of 50 shares or less.

If you place a sell order, and it meets the below criteria, then Robinhoood will waive the respective fees.

* SEC Trading Fee: Robinhood Financial will not pass these fees to its customers for sales with a notional value of $500 or less.
* FINRA Trading Activity Fee: Robinhood Financial will not pass these fees to its customers for sales of 50 shares or less. 

Keep in mind that the above criteria for waiving fees will only apply to selling equity orders. This will **not** apply to selling Option orders.",I thought RobbingHood was free to trade,1.0,1615258052,dumpling987

Company reported a record set of number, $54.7 billion in loan volume, a 71% increase from the 4Q19 $31.9 billion loan volume, bringing UWM’s full year 2020 production to $182.5 billion, which is 69% higher than UWM’s prior record production for 2019 of $107.8 billion.

So don’t you think this will moon harder than RKT they just had a pretty big rally and i honestly think UWMC Can do a lot better especially if we can beat the shorts out and cause them to cover. It is the number one most shorted stock right now too. Also UWMC is “the #1 wholesale mortgage lender” prepping to enter the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indexes with a big splash.

[The Hive Mind Trader - Theory](https://preview.redd.it/h0sal7sy2xl61.jpg?width=256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d7033601ffa63fc64c10ad7f85df32b78ad1cc3)

I have decided to post elements of my work that have led me to produce proven theories with a very high probability of success. Such as being able to preemptively determine when GME will go parabolic. This is not me stating, this has been witnessed and utilized by others with a determining factor of success. To include the study of unique behavior patterns of individual stocks and industry. The thing about data is it is no good unless someone else can learn it and benefit from it.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I am posting the crude work. At some point, I will clean it all up so it can be prettier and even have a flow sheet of sorts, but right now, I want to keep the focus on the depth of work and get feedback from others of like mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe that this community of new traders has good intentions with their money. The ability to ascertain data that is truly helpful is scarce. We can seek out the most mentioned post or the percentage change of posts. However, that kind of data, albeit helpful, ends once the person clicks through. My goal is to treat my data like open-source code. If a person could take what I have produced and make it better, then the purpose has been served.

&amp;#x200B;

This theory provides you explicit data outcomes that will provide you with what stock to select based on industry, 5 selected companies that share the same industry, the volume, price. As detailed in theory within, the data can be easily replaced to produce a different response as long as you follow the theory's criteria.

&amp;#x200B;

At the core, this theory has derivatives of Newton's First Law of Motion:

*An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. (i.e., Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.)*

[When we select a point in time, we do not want the first of the last 15-minute green volume bar. The Pv value is taken from the 2nd highest green peak and then the Dv is the next green bar to the left of the Pv bar. This is considered the momentum value.](https://preview.redd.it/vuq48i463xl61.png?width=2312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08b11e38ff7c5c46a0e73e941f93e8f135d37fc8)

[Data Sets: If take SNDL and look at Data Set 1, we will use day 3 of 5 as our sample date in the cycle of 5. In this case, we use 2\/14. Hone in on 10:15 \(Volume 26,580\) and 10:45AM \(Volume 22,248\). 10:15 is the Dv factor and 10:45 is the Pv value. It is done this way because we will gather the data by scan from right to left on that day to attain the first top 15-minute green bar and then the next highest green, in this case, it is at 10:15. \*All data within may have a slight variance, but the process to attain the outcome for your desired industry, the company is no different.](https://preview.redd.it/2nt9b94a3xl61.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d5328d475c3566d64972b2cd1477a87e1887d5)

[We apply a Frequency Polygon, to construct the basis of our theory. This is to determine the frequency in which the 5 stocks will pass through the determined value ranges that come from the Frequency value.](https://preview.redd.it/r4vx91mi3xl61.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3296ed076084c69ecaa660abf0446c58bff7cd5)
