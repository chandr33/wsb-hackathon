Guys, thanks for all the love on that. Continuing...

We have to understand the bond market or at least have a general idea of what it is. So, no bear scenarios just yet.

**Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds.**

Just what the hell are they? Give it to me like I‚Äôm 8.

They are literally a way for the government to raise capital to use in projects like Covid relief. Not only for negative scenarios but for good ones also, like infrastructure.

**Why different names?**

Treasury Bills: Short term maturity date. Year or less.

Treasury Notes: Mid term maturity date. 2 to 10 years.

Treasury Bonds: Long term maturity date. 10+ to 30 years. Fun fact. They actually thought about issuing 100 year bonds back in 2019. LOL?

**Why they are SOOO important?**

I can‚Äôt stress enough how important they are. They're as important as your paycheck to you. On a government scale.

US Bond market is twice as big than the stock market and it trades at a higher volume. Daily. Mostly, investment banks buys them via auctions and offers them to their clients around the world in secondary markets.

I wanna invest in government backed bonds too! You can do that by buying ETFs through ticker symbols like TLT, SHY, SHV etc.

I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd wanna do that but okay. For instance, SHY moved 6 bucks in 15 years üôÑ It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for you and I to buy bonds. However, if you have billions of dollars sitting around that 10YR 1.6% yield we‚Äôre gonna talk about brings tens of millions backed by ‚ÄòMurica. Hell yeah!

**The infamous 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD.**

Keeping it simple, not going into Coupon Yields. It‚Äôs the interest rate the government pays when it borrows money. Just like your credit card. You use the card, Chase charges you interest.

In our most glorious decade (1990-2000) 10 year treasury yield traded between 5 to 7% compared to 1.6% last Friday. WTF? Yields going up is a good thing for long term economy. They're going up, so what the hell is the problem? Problem is not that they‚Äôre going up, it‚Äôs how fast they‚Äôre going up. 

When yields decline, money flows into other equities like stock market with the hopes of better return of investment. Now, when life is normal, this flow or outflow isn‚Äôt visible in short term, because yields don‚Äôt go up or down drastically in matter of weeks. Until recently. 

Putting it in perspective. Here‚Äôs an aha moment for you. You keep hearing TSLA stock price is overvalued, P/E ratio at 140x hurrr...durrrr...That‚Äôs because money got poured into growth stocks like TSLA and AMZN the last decade due to declining yields. What sector is the most promising in terms of future growth? Tech. When yields spiked in matter of weeks, tech took a big shit. Because it was the most ‚Äúleveraged‚Äù sector. Just look at this goddam chart. It‚Äôs crazy.

My apologies for not delivering **Bear Scenarios** tonight. I am six beers into a beautiful Sunday weather and I'd like to take my time making a solid bear case. We've at least established how important bond market is and how it controls the entire economy. It'd make a good case when SPY hits 400 in about 18 hours. Oh by the way, I think 10 Year Treasury bond will get close to 3% by Christmas and shit's gonna hit the fan. Cheers.",Introduction to Treasury Bonds for Beginners.,1.0,1615771739,DaySwingTrade

18,m59mdx,"First things first, if you aren‚Äôt chucking any of your Biden bucks into at least one of share of GameStop, you‚Äôre living in the wrong timeline. 

Secondly, I am not a financial advisor, I have a micro penis, and I am absolutely not qualified for financial advice. I do however have some points that I would like to bring to your attention and ones that I think could be very lucrative. 

I would like to bring to your attention 3 simple points that I believe could potentially change your financial future.

1). UWMC was listed as a preliminary IPO addition to the Russell 1000, 1 of just 10 companies to be on the list of potential inclusions. 
   
   This is enormous, this means that all of the Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000 ETF‚Äôs will be potentially automatically picking up UWMC on reconstruction date, and dropping the stocks that are no longer in the Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000. Large ETF funds acquiring UWMC shares on a grand scale is certainly a catalyst for upward price movement. 

   When does this take effect you ask? March 21st. This is the date that funds across the globe will be dropping old stocks, and adding UWMC into the ranks of their balanced Russell boomer ETF funds. [More on that, here](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/prelimary_ipo_additions_1_qtr_r1000.pdf)

2). $UWMC has been slathered across r/WSB for quite some time now, leading me to believe it‚Äôs considered within the realm of ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù that have been receiving considerable attention recently, specifically within options contracts (a favorite weapon of mass destruction of r/WSB). 

   Normally, this would indicate higher levels of attention toward this stock, but this isn‚Äôt a normal case. On 3/19 an incredibly rare financial event is happening that only happens a few times a year. This is called the [Quadruple Witching](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/q/quadruple-witching). 

   This does only indicate higher volatility, however when combined with the other catalysts I believe will not only result in higher volatility, but specifically a higher upward price action volatility.

3). The CEO of rocket has enormous monkey nuts that have chosen to drop on the day of 3/15. What exactly is happening you ask? [In case you‚Äôve been living under a rock](https://m.benzinga.com/article/20017185), as it has been slathered on this subreddit for days now. The CEO has made a very risky move, but a calculated one.

   This is no ordinary addendum as there is almost NO chance that this sticks after rocket inevitably fights this battle in court. The underlying action is not what is important here, it‚Äôs the very news itself. 

   The CEO and likely entire team at UWMC ([as it‚Äôs backed by many big name investment bankers like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, etc)  likely want to get a piece of the GameStop esque squeeze action. (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005895/en/United-Wholesale-Mortgage-LLC-and-Gores-Holdings-IV-Inc.-Announce-Closing-of-Business-Combination). They‚Äôre no fools, they understand that big attention (from this phony addendum), big volume (from the Russell addition and listing), that strikes swiftly (quadruple witching) is a recipe for gamma and short squeezes. [(UWMC has roughly a 28% short interest which is very considerable)](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc).

I understand that the majority of investors in GME are looking to make some bank. While I‚Äôd love to claim I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äústick it to the man‚Äù, that is merely a cherry-on-top to the financial part of the equation. With that said, the amazing amount of posts of pet adoptions (as annoying as their quantity may be lol) has changed my motives. As of now, the wealthiest among us seemingly worry about one thing .... becoming wealthier. While some do good deeds and have good intentions, that percentage seems to be small compared to the others.  What I‚Äôve learned over the weekend is that their money would be much better off with these apes, because it seems that apes truly do have a motive with money being used to make the world a better place.

I commend every single one of you who have adopted an animal, whether you‚Äôve gotten your tendies or not. It has inspired me greatly. Right now, money is proverbially being stacked on top of an enormous pile behind a locked door, never to be used. Between the adoption and others posting generous acts they have done since late January, it‚Äôs nice to see the money being used for good, rather than just adding another $0 to your net worth.

Stop believing every post that‚Äôs on here that says the stock is going to the moon this week boys! Or 10k this Friday based off this pretty graph I made and put in some lines. No one, on Reddit, can predict the stock. Just get your shares. Hold them. Buy more if/when you can. Order actual games and consoles from them. If you‚Äôre going to invest in something, don‚Äôt just get stock. Supporting the actual business helps the stocks. Sit back, relax, don‚Äôt look at your stocks constantly throughout the day. Trust me, when this shit takes off, you‚Äôll hear about it without having to look at your portfolio or the latest post. 

Also, it was annoying at first, but then it was funny when the names started to get better, but those monkey and gorilla adoptions are genius! I even think there was an owl or some shit in there too.",Stop believing the pretty charts everyone posts,1.0,1615773894,Beneficial-Milk5849
