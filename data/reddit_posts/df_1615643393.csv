10,m46rxa,"You lose 37% because of taxes, leaving you with $63,000. Don't try to evade taxes because you will get caught.

So, you've got $63,000 to your name. That's life changing money.

You can pay off your car loans. I don't know what car you've got, but let's say that leaves you with $53,000.

You keep $15,000 for investing in stocks; now you have $38,000. You use $5000 to treat yourself, your girlfriend/your wife and possibly your wife's boyfriend. You still have $33,000 left. Split half of it for emergencies and the other half for necessities and monthly expenses. This means $16,500 available contributed to both.

You might think there's nothing left now, but basically you've paid a big bill. You have money available to grow through trading stocks, heck, through investing in stocks. You have savings available for when things don't run as smoothly, and you've got money available to pay for expenses for the coming months. 

You're set for a while, while earning your wage for some time. Even if you don't have a job, you now have time to find a job will still being able to buy groceries and pay your bills.

Okay, so here comes the flipside of the coin: what if that $63,000 was only $1000? Would you be able to do all the above?

Sure, $1000 is a lot for a lot of people, which is a bad thing, as wealth isn't distributed fairly in the world, but let's stick to the situation at hand.

Would you prefer the $63,000 or the $1,000?

I know your answer.

Someone needs to give it to you as simple as possible so here we go:
- Stock continues to end higher moving into to the weekend. That’s good news. Stop complaining.
- Stock price shoots higher when the demand (people buying) increases. That’s been happening for about two weeks. Slowed Thursday and Friday.
- If no one is buying and no one is selling, stock holds.
- If more are selling, stock falls.
- If more are buying, stock rises.
- If you’re placing these ridiculous calls and bets on the stock going high, you aren’t really helping to move the needle.

27,m46zmf,"Hey everyone, it’s been a stressful week staring at GME for the entirety of the week, the past few weeks. 

Here’s some ideas on how to destress: 
- Go for a walk in the Forrest, woods or just around the city. (Depending on where you live)

- Feed the homeless 

- Talk to the Humane Society about volunteering

- Listen to your favorite music while on a drive 

- Call your mom/dad for a chat, they probably miss you

- Thank someone who helped you in the past

- If you were a paper handed boy, Donate some 
tendies to help your community. 

- If you are a Diamond Handed Man, donate some money to your community (GME will pay you back in the near future)

- Learn to knit

- Paint something, and it doesn’t even have to be good because “there’s no such things as mistakes, just happy accidents.”

- “Don’t forget to tell these special people in your life in your life just how special they are”

62,m47da9,"Not that it matters much, but **Nokia** ([NYSE:NOK](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/nokia-corporation/nok/)) isn't an American company, and the stock in question isn't technically a stock. Rather, it's a U.S.-listed American depositary receipt (ADR) reflecting the U.S. dollar value of shares of the Finnish company as issued in Helsinki. Nevertheless, you can step into this solid company's ADR at a price of just above $4, giving you a round lot -- 100 shares -- for less than $500.

And doing so makes sense given the company's prospects.

There's the Nokia you know -- the one that makes so-called feature phones and low-cost smartphones. Then there's the Nokia you don't know -- the one that makes networking equipment needed by telecom companies, along with the software and intellectual property needed to make those networks function. It's building several different 5G networks in overseas markets, for instance, and at the same time actively monetizing its intellectual property. Earlier this month, the company announced a significant patent licensing deal with **Samsung Electronics**. This is by far Nokia's breadwinning business.

The company is expected to post steady sales and earnings this year and next as it [rebuilds itself](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/11/where-will-nokia-stock-be-in-1-year/). Given the recovery backdrop at the same time the [5G revolution](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) is beginning in earnest, those outlooks may underestimate what's coming for this telecom [technology](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/) player.",3 Top Stocks Under $5,1.0,1615645833,Shark0710

MODS: Please don't delete. 

A pretty straight forward question here. As we all know, RH halted GME buying and subsequently the movement that was cranking up halted and dropped. A lot of us bought the stock during that ""cranking up"" with intention of it going further and further with unknown ending points. We went long. RH did their blocking and it lead to the lawsuits of RH users wanting to buy.

What about the potential unknown gains of GME buyers on other platforms effected by the RH halt, the gains that didn't happen and we don't know could have happened? The speculated gains? Is there some meat here against RH for non-RH users? After all, RH seems to have clearly halted that movement.

72,m47jys,"AMC filed Wanda's intent to convert it's class B shares into class A shares on Feb 5th to the SEC. AMC's CEO recently stated that this was triggered by share dilution causing Wanda's majority shares fell below 30% and currently only sits at 9%. On March 10th it seemed like shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow rate plummeted. If you assume that the filing becomes official on the first business day after filing then it would have been official Feb 8th. If you count 30 days from Feb 8th then it would be March 10th. On March 10th it seemed that shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow plummeted. 

Is it possible that Wanda had a 30 day period where they weren't allowed to sell shares? As a matter of fact it seems that Wanda may have sold ALL their shares all together. Motley Fools' website lists institutional ownership as of March 13 and Wanda isn't listed at all. 

Another thing I read is that Class B shareholders are the last to receive any compensation if the company goes bankrupt. Why would Wanda ok the dilution of AMC's shares knowing it would cause them to lose the majority control they paid 2.6 Billion dollars for? Could it be that AMC fully anticipated going bankrupt prior to the reddit rally? I know that hypothesis doesn't jive with what was said in the shareholders meeting but I don't think anything they said necessarily disproves anything I've hypothesized. Nor would anything they said be a lie. They did very specifically point out that Wanda's position was held as of March 3rd. 

Why is March 3rd significant? That is 30 days from Feb 1 which is the day that the original reporting states that Wanda announced to AMC they would be converting shares. Would the same 30 day rule apply? They had to wait 30 days to disclose to the company their intent to sell and then 30 days from the SEC filing date to officially sell?",Wanda AMC hypothesis,1.0,1615646451,grey_bush314

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls &amp; puts  
There is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet   
The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)  


.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.  


There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)  


On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.  


So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That’s al to of bananas. Like a lot.  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That’s quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.

Other information I like:  
65.2 million outstanding shares   
short float is 54.16 million   
according to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),  
short interest according to Morningstar is 52% .

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).  
Short total should be around 28million shares.  
**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.  


Go long, and stay strong  


**Positions:**
