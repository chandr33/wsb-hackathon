Robinhood is telling me I have 2 shares in UWMC but I can't sell those shares??? This why I pulled out of robinhood in the first place and this is money I didn't care about anyways but screw them. I can only imagine if I had more money in this how much this could screw me over. I know their customer support is awful so I'm not sure what to do.

16,m0m9a6,"So I purchased some shares of RKT last week, and still have them.

I'll take an article as an example of what will happen next, here:

  
\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Rocket Companies (NYSE: [RKT](https://www.streetinsider.com/stock_lookup.php?q=RKT)) declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share.

The dividend will be payable on March 23, 2021, to stockholders of record on March 9, 2021, with an ex-dividend date of March 8, 2021.

The annual yield on the dividend is 5.6 percent.

For a dividend history and other dividend-related data on Rocket Companies (RKT) [click here](http://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=RKT).

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

  
Can anyone help interpret this for me? Should I hold until market close tomorrow (March 9), and if I sold would I still be a part of the dividend if they execute it? I'd then be paid on that dividend two weeks later regardless if I hold?

And what is the annual yield portion regarding? Would I have to hold onto the stock for that to also take place?

Within two weeks of installing the ERP Suite, BP was able to unlock approximately $50 million in working capital and has the potential to unlock further savings if applied across their worldwide supply chain,” the company said.

If you don't think this is significant you're  lying to yourselves.  Companies will be lining up to intergrate their data with PLTR and instantly can start saving money.   Please  can some Computer science Nerd explain how regular shit ERP works vs the Dynamic AI ERP functions.

All in all, Pltr will be saving companies Millions of dollars and this stock is going to moon and a lot of you will FOMO buy because of how many more institutions are buying the dip.  I see a lot of Cathie Bae slander recently and I can't wait she cucks you all again with PLTR!

95,m0ml57,"I could have made some good money back today but for some reason I feel like Its going to go back to 498 again. I bought some at 80 and could have doubled down today but I honestly see us going to at least 500 again.

I'm going to be honest, I've never invested money before. All I know how to do is hold, and I mean that seriously and not as a joke. But I can't help but feel like I'm being greedy.",Does anyone feel greedy holding GME?,0.5,1615228737,-tRabbit
96,m0ml86,"I've been thinking about this for a few days now. But what's the highest GME could possibly go to. There's a lot of posts saying this person is waiting till 100,000. That person until 1 million. Or another to 690,000. 

Not a finance expert, just your regular retard that doesn't even know how to eat a crayon properly (wrapper or no wrapper, melted or not?) but wouldn't the highest amount be simply the liquid flow of any hedge funds and shorters divided by the number shares needed to cover? I don't actually know what either of those numbers is though. Best guess is assuming one hedge fund with 300 billion in wealth (guess based on fact they've lost XX billion so far) and I think last I saw (which was a while ago tbh) 50 million to cover. That would make 6 million/share max. Of course that's an oversimplification and not even taking into account guesses for when other hodlers will bail.

Tldr: What do you think is the max GME could hit (shorters liquidity/shares to cover) and what do you think would realistically be where it reaches?

99,m0mlq1,"A year ago tonight, my best friend was murdered. Shit sucked. Still does. Fucked up my whole life. The day of the funeral I lost my job to covid. Luckily I work at a good restaurant and they brought me back. I honestly kinda wish they hadn’t, as it’s been so stressful dealing with all the new rules and keeping people safe. Basically everything that could go wrong has gone wrong this year. You know the story, you probably lived it this year. But all of that changed in November when I saw the short squeeze post. 

It wasn’t immediate, but suddenly I had something to think about other than how awful life has been. I bought and sold and bought and sold and managed to lose like $60 on 40 shares over a few months and was done with GME. Then my belief was reaffirmed when it started climbing again. And I bought back in. Best decision of my life. 

I finally had a reason to wake up again. First it was just because it was a lifetime chance to make some cash, but it quickly grew into something indescribable. Everyone was talking about it, at work, at the store, my brother, literally everyone was talking about it. But they didn’t get. You all did. We all knew what was coming. We watched the storm building and raised our sails, trusting that if enough fucking retards did it too the wind would be manageable and we could sail to Valhalla, leaving the dock Wall Street aflame. 

I guess it comes full circle again today. The squeeze popped off again on a day that could’ve left me crippled but it’s pulled my out. I know that it’s all coincidence, but damn if it doesn’t feel good. You all have changed my life and made me believe in something again. 

I know this is way too long for you smooth brains, but thank you for being so damn stupid that this worked.",Another wsb changed my life story,1.0,1615228782,hugh985
