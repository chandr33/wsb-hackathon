10,m2432j,"The ""Pump and Dump"" people have very successfully suckered a whole bunch of people.  GME just dropped 140 points in a matter of minutes.  So the guys behind the ""Pump and Dump"" gambit have cashed in their chips.  Its a very old sucker play dating to the late 1800s.  People would form small secret groups of very weathly investors to pull off this trick in the 1920s.  The secret group would pore millions of dollars into a stock driving the stock price upwards.  The rising stock price would excite thousands of naive investors who would then start poring their money into the stock like mad causing the price to soar even further upwards.  When it reached a very high price the secret group would dump all of their shares at once at the very high price and walk away with millions of dollars while the naive investors lost their shirts.  Well done and well executed. I'm impressed.",The secret GME stock manipulation group has successfully suckered everyone,1.0,1615399488,rjthedj99

Like I said, not a fucking clue about trading, but...I do know about cause and effect. Recently, the JNJ COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the CDC for emergency use. If you have been paying attention to the rise in usage of COVID-19 vaccines, you'll know that Johnson&amp;Johnson's vax is a one-dose wonder. I believe this will be enough to overtake the other vaccines in usage. Thus, causing the stock to rise exponentially. I know another thing, this sub has a 4chan atmosphere, and getting 4channers to rally is difficult due to the retardation and autism. But please, just this once, JNJ stock will be a hit. So, let's XLR8 the boost.
