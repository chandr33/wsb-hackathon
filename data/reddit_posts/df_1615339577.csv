But now with finally seeing green for the first time and knowing I wasn't a paper handed bitch, I finally told her what I did with some of the tax return.  After some time of explaining what's going on and showing her some memes she finally isn't just giving me the stink eye for ""spending money"" without her knowing.  Every hour I'm showing her $GME climbing.  With the last update she told me she's glad I didnt have soft paper bag hands 🤣😂

As millions of others also come to the realization that we need to educate ourselves out of my current lifestyle, I dusted off my old, never read, 'Security Analysis' book to see if I can learn me a thing or two.  

Along those lines,  I figure I could read thru the sub-reddit /r/securityanalysis and help my endeavor.  

The first post I stumble across (compliments of  [u/noveltieaccount](https://www.reddit.com/user/noveltieaccount/)) reads: 

""We shall conclude with a practical observation that is based on experience rather than theory. When the general market is high there are always a number of individual issues that appear definitely undervalued by objective standards and consequently even more attractive in contrast to the inflated level of other stocks. The analyst may be tempted to recommend these as unusual opportunities. Not only may the “neglected security” continue neglected for the remainder of the bull market, but when the downturn comes it is likely to decline in price along with the general market and to fully as great an extent. In a word, beware of “bargains” when most stocks seem very high."" 

I guess Mr. Gill questioned himself enough at the beginning of his find that he certainly found Graham to be **WRONG**.  Either that, or the newcomer Mr. Cohen said - I'm going to change the trajectory of this flagging company myself, and together they straight flunked Ben Graham (In Grahams defense, the text is 86 years old).  Goes to show that methods and companies do need to be studied, monitored and tweaked to fit the environment to stand the test of time.
