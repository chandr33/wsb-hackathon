27,lweje6,"**The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**

The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.

VWAPs can be treated as the ""true"" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a ""bounce"" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.

There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.

Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.

In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.

Happy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock

2. Tanger shopping traffic just returned to pre covid levels.  Since it's structured as a REIT, it's legally required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to investors.  The 2nd stimulus hasn't even gone through yet.  The parking lots are packed where I live in NC.
3. Outdoor shopping is now preferred.   This is where people will be spending their stimulus check this spring and summer.  Also, Tanger is located in a lot tourist areas and people will be travelling like crazy this spring to make up for lost time.

94,lwerrx,"**Transition from hardware to software**

Blackberry has transitioned from a hardware cellphone maker to a software developer focused on cyber security.

Benefits of this include transitioning away from a highly saturated market dominated by big players such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei. This has increased gross margins to 76% up 29 points from 2016. 

This move has also expanded Blackberry’s reach in terms of different industries as they provide cybersecurity for average consumers, automakers (particularly in the ev and autonomous vehicle sectors), governments (used by 18 of the G20 countries) and banking/finance (used by the top 9/10 banks in the world.

Another positive of this move is that it has put Blackberry into a fast growing industry in cybersecurity. Since the beginning of Covid 19, the transition to online work has quickened. With this cyber crime has also sped up. As well with technology being integrated into every part of our lives such as smart homes and cars the need for strong cybersecurity has been on the rise. According to Forbes the industry is currently worth $173b and is expected to rise to $270b by 2026.

**Blackberry Services**

Cylance

Cylance is the average consumer product. It is an antivirus that detects malware and ransomware. It uses a subscription based model. The technology is very good and easy to use although lacks some features found in competitors such as Norton or McAfee. Overall the product needs some improvement but is still very good.

Blackberry QNX

Blackberry QNX is the auto protection product. It is currently used in 175 million cars. They have recently announced partnerships with AWS and Baidu to expand this product. The Baidu partnership should open Blackberry up to the large and fast growing Chinese EV market. Another positive about this product is that regulation around the security of cars is increasing as more technology is incorporated into the vehicles. As the global EV market increases so should QNX.

Other Products

Blackberry makes a ton of other products such as IVY, UEM, SPARK among many others. 

**Financial Information (USD)**

Revenue: Blackberry lost $150 million in 2020. Comes to $0.32 a share.

Assets: Blackberry owns over 38000 patents. They also have $3.888 billion worth of assets.

**Conclusion**

I believe that Blackberry is a buy in the long run. They are in a fast growing industry and have some of the best software in the industry.

**My Position**

I currently own 45 shares @ $15.33 CAD
