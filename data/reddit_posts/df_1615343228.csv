2,m1n2ls,"I am a new investor (started 3 weeks ago), but have been an ape since birth. I stumbled upon wall street bets exactly 3 weeks ago bc of the January GME scandal (randomly ran into a YouTube vid). I was like that's kind of fkd up, let's see what these retards are all about and if I can help. Never in my life have I lost so many brain cells going through passages of text, but I've also never felt so alive.

I have been holding and will continue holding until we reach the moon 🚀🚀 Although I must confess, since I don't have any experience in option/stock trading, I don't know what has been harder for me in the past three weeks, holding stock at -1.5K loss, holding at a 5K profit, or holding my wife's boyfriend's popcorn while he bangs my wife 🤷

I am also the alpha ape with no shirt on in the videos. 

I have proof that Goldman Sachs has manipulated the stock NIO using analyst downgrades and upgrades and buying and selling immediately after making hundreds of millions of dollars. Their buys and sells of both NIO stock and options correspond directly with their media releases. Fei Fang is the analyst who is the main culprit. 
I have gathered a mountain of evidence the last two years using Fintel and other resources to see the amounts, dates and all the maneuvering and how it links to the press releases. They used delisting as one fear tactic. The next was Covid worries in China.  Their downgrades were met with calls and buys and its glaringly obvious the manipulation. 

I would like to start a discussion and if anyone is interested you can go on Fintel and see basic info with dates, google NIO Goldman and things like upgrade- downgrade-Fei Fang- Covid and delisting. 

Goldman used NIO as a person piggy bank and the victims were the common investors hard earned money.

1. Citadel is hedging the options.  I believe it to be true, and if it weren't, gamma squeezes would not occur.  So let's just assume that they are.  

2. Market makers are allowed to ""naked short sell"" in order to provide liquidity to the market.  We know this is happening, because the % of float being held is over 100%.  Yes, it technically could be through legal, normal shorting, but it probably isn't, because of point #1.  If a gamma is running high the option hedgers need a million shares now, the market maker is the one providing that.  They simply have to be.  I guess I just believe it to be true.  

SO here's my question... isn't citadel also the market maker for the shares?  Like, who is buying from who?  If the options trader is buying on the market, are they simply getting a little bit from 4 other shops?  Aren't the all essentially doing the same stuff?  SO they are naked short selling their own shares to the options hedgers....thereby nullifying point #1 ??????

71,m1nabv,"What is the wash-sale rule?

When you sell an investment that has lost money in a taxable account, you can get a tax benefit. The wash-sale rule keeps investors from selling at a loss, buying the same (or ""substantially identical"") investment back within a 61-day window, and claiming the tax benefit. It applies to most of the investments you could hold in a typical brokerage account or IRA, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and options.

More specifically, the wash-sale rule states that the tax loss will be disallowed if you buy the same security, a contract or option to buy the security, or a ""substantially identical"" security, within 30 days before or after the date you sold the loss-generating investment (it's a 61-day window).

It's important to note that you cannot get around the wash-sale rule by selling an investment at a loss in a taxable account, and then buying it back in a tax-advantaged account. Also, the IRS has stated it believes a stock sold by one spouse at a loss and purchased within the restricted time period by the other spouse is a wash sale. Check with your tax advisor regarding your personal situation.",Just a reminder about the wash sale rule for those that paper handed earlier.,1.0,1615343919,TheDeliciousMeats

Or would you leave it alone and hope the option/s is/are not exercised.

I have done the math, and I would spend $9k for $14k IF the market can maintain its current price. I would need to liquidate other  holdings to fund my option buy back.

At least the shares were in the green and purchased with earnings from the January spike, but I’ll be shedding a tear when the squeeze is squoze. Par for the course for my inability to pull profits off the table — I’ve had $15,000 in tendies evaporate overnight or gap past my stop-limits in the past month and was hoping this GME spike could bring my account back into balance.

98,m1ndeh,"I just want to be able to offer encouragement and DD and ""if X does Y I'll do Z"" for example:

My Dad is amazing, he has worked his ass off for 40 years to take care of his family not just my mom and us kids but also has been paying all of his mom's bills and rent for the last 20 years on only 40-80k/year. Not only was he hit hard in 2008, he worked for a lighting company for 17 years and then they moved to a different state and went out of business, so he had to restart at a new company. Last summer due to covid after working at the new company  he was laid off less than 4 years away from retirement. He knew I was actively trading and asked about GME in January when it was peaking, I explained the situation without giving financial advice and was kinda surprised to hear the next day that he had bought shares at $316 on the second peak, he literally never saw green but he and I have been diamond handing the whole way. We're coming back for him!

I owe him so much for everything he has done for me financially in my life and I have literally no idea how he has managed to afford what he has done. He helped me out when my ex emptied my bank account and stole my car and I haven't been able to pay him back anything since. And the worst part is he doesn't want or expect anything from me.

So here's the accountability, after the Squeeze is squoze I'll be writing my dad a check for either $20k or 10% of my total whichever is bigger. Make a note of this, proof or ban me later
