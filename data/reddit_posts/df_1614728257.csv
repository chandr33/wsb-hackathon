Here is the FINRA report:

And here is MarketWatch: 

https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest

According to Marketwatch, ISUN is the most shorted company at the moment. However, Finra  reports only 17 percent short float. 

What do I miss? With this small market cap and around 669 thousand shares float (yes you saw that right 669), it could be the ultimate squeeze. It do feel like it was targeted by big players to push it down although I am not sure about that. Would be nice if someone could check it. I am also holding GME like a good ape so don’t judge me just to bring up another stock but if MarketWatch data is true it could be an easy one.

I’m new here and I think this is great but one thing, I think, needs to be said:

The retard jokes and your wife’s boyfriend shit is great. Lol. But I think some people are on here just for clout and writing, “Guess I’ll buy more GME 🤷🏼‍♂️” when in reality, they’re not doing dick. 

Some of these posts are actually really informative and I want to read about the real discussion that people have between each other but before I do that I have to filter through the hoard of moon emojis, movie references, and bifurcated conversations that move 5 miles a minute. I get it, this is the nature of the beast, but can we try to make a more conscious effort to keep the informative posts less cluttered? I think that less clutter will leave real information visible, allowing everyone to receive their new-found confidence if they had lost it. 

Let’s help each other stay informed and not post on certain things just for the sake of posting. Contribute to the posts with substance otherwise let the real information drown and let the people be uninformed.

55,lwfyks,"\-My thesis is: fedboi is guna get fucky with inflation and rates. People will want to take a smaller loan out, and use more cash, because inflation creates spending and high interest rates deter people from collecting debt. Housing prices are in a bubble right now due to low rates. That bubble will pop when rates rise. Rates will rise, inflation will rise, cash spending will rise, debt will lower, houses will sell cheaper. REITs will continue to yield great earnings and totally recover; big tendies.

""I don’t follow that logic, I think higher rates with inflation will cause a net no change to house prices""

 \-You don't think higher rates affect housing cost? 

 ""Yes, higher rates usually drop home prices but wouldn’t inflation pick it back up?"" 

\-Inflation isn't considered *in the moment* the way rates are. Inflation takes 3months to two years for change to occur. When you get a quote for an interest rate, at max it'll last 3 months before you gotta pull a trigger

\-As inflation rises, people will have more cash to spend, which leads to more cash up front for down payment. Usually, a higher down payment = negotiation of lower house price.  
\-So, people will have both, more cash for down payment and a higher interest on a loan = perfect leverage for a lower price, this means a higher execution of sales... 

 ""Wouldn’t that create higher demand?"" 

\-Demand is high right now, highest it has ever been. But, that doesn't lead to execution if the buyer isn't comfortable with the price. A lot of deals that have gone on this year failed to execute. This is usually because a homeowner sends in the inspector and lists some things to knock price down (which is typical) and the homeowner doesn't budge because they were only ever interested in selling for the ridiculously high prices other homes are selling for. House doesn't sell and homeowner ends up waiting for a better time in the market than in the middle of winter (when rates were lowest and demand was still growing)

\-Lower rates create higher demand. Demand is super high right now, another reason prices are ballooned too much. Demand cant get higher than where it is, so I believe it will go down when people get rates twice what they were 3 months prior. 

\-My point being, the price will come down when it gets to brass and taxes. Houses will sell and people will be there to buy. REITs will still pull hefty profits and will recover.
