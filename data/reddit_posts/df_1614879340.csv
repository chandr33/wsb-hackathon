12,lxqcub,"Live nations current price is a joke, they’re going to be diluting shares and raising capital soon, they have to or risk default. This is obvious from their financial statements and the fact they used the word “default” over 100 times in their quarterly report. 
Somehow they’re above their pre Covid high. That’s right, they’ve lost about a billion dollars over the last year and they’re above their all time high. Not only that, they’ve been running up and it’s time for a natural pull back. That coupled with the poor financial state of the company and the directionless market we find ourselves in could be cause for a 30+% correction. I think there is a big pent up demand for live events but if this pandemic has shown anything, people have adapted. A lot of people are cutting deals directly with venues and selling tickets on their website cutting out middle men. The pandemic has really caused the company to lose their shirt. I expect them to raise at least 500mm by June to cover expenses and pay down debt. Pt 60.

Here's where this shit gets interesting, this bond fiasco and tech pullback had lead to a $10+ fall from recent highs.  All the sudden my MU 87.5c 4/16 are no longer up 150% but I'm 💎🙌 this bitch so I double down and grab some MU 95c 4/16 @  300. 

Key point here is DRAM and NAND spot prices 🚀🚀 🌑 at the moment, if you thought earnings were already priced in they aren't any more.  This means when micron announces earnings March 31 the guidance is going to be rediculous and this bitch is going 10% up and starting another leg up. 

My only regret is not cashing when I was  up $650 a contract so I could buy more on this pullback.

95,lxqr88,"Disclaimer: I have calls on both of these and this is my ""investment"" thesis. 

TLDR: Fluor's NuScale should speed up the development and rollout of SMRs and Cameco should be able to sell more uranium to America as the SMR technology becomes more widely adopted.

Cameco Uranium Corp: TSE::CCO / NYSE::CCJ
- Produces 9% of the world's uranium 

Fluor Corp: NYSE::FLR
- Instrumental in the R&amp;D of Small Modular Reactors through its subsidiary, NuScale.
- SMRs have been approved by regulators in Utah
- Regulatory hurdles still exist but this is largely due to varying regulatory regimes between countries 
-There has been a strong push for harmonization over recent years due to these inconsistencies, but my focus is mainly for use cases within the US
- NuScale also operates in the Rare Earth metals sector, which like uranium, is critical to economic and national security

Cameco Corp is the second largest uranium miner in the world, based in Canada (we have around 15% of the world's uranium). Number one asset is its Cigar Lake Mine which has been shut down since mid-2020 due to covid. With the vaccine rollout coming, the company would benefit from a strong infusion of cash to quickly restart operations at the mine. They have a supply contract with a Chinese utility but because of their production issues they're being forced to buy and sell uranium at spot prices to honor the contract, this isn't sustainable and puts the Uranium industry in North America at risk because Cameco (due to the mine closure) is unhedged against a jump in uranium spot prices. To make matters worse, a Chinese SOE has recently taken 49% equity in Kazatomprom (world's largest uranium producer, state owned by Kazakhstan with China holding the 49% minority interest). This means that for every dollar paid for Kazatomprom's uranium, China makes 49 cents and Cameco loses potential market share (even though it is under obligation to fulfill its supply contract to the Chinese, regardless of limited production due to the mine shutdown).

The good news here is that a new technology is on the horizon. A technology called ""Small Modular Reactors"", which have already received regulatory approval in some states. These are nuclear fission reactors that are much smaller, more efficient, and safer, than traditional reactors. Due to these factors, the upfront cost of integrating these SMRs into a broader modernized nuclear infrastructure could be much lower due to shorter project time horizons, lower material costs relative to potential energy yields, and thus less uncertainty/risk. Being newer and more efficient technology also results in less cash burn. Traditionally, the initial investments in nuclear power have come from the government because private investors were uncomfortable with the project time horizons and initial costs. This can change now with the opportunity provided by SMRs. 

The current US nuclear infrastructure relies largely on Plutonium inputs and is generally old tech that has been around for decades, but SMRs can run on uranium that undergoes a much less costly enrichment process prior to use (Plutonium is mainly manufactured in nuclear reactors from fissioning uranium due to its lack of natural abundance). If the market can guide a wider push to modernize the US nuclear infrastructure through adoption of SMRs, Cameco would be the ideal supplier of Uranium to power those reactors as it wouldn't have to be converted into to plutonium first, just slightly enriched. The alternative is buying from Kazatomprom, and giving money to China every time you turn the lights on. Energy security is national security. Sure, depending on Canada for Uranium isn't as great as relying on your own supplies, but the US doesn't domestically produce enough Uranium to make that feasible. Canada is a loyal US ally and our nuclear sector overall employs and contracts many engineers and national security experts from the US Navy. 

Given the times and the geopolitical/geoeconomic dynamic between China and Western powers, it makes sense for America to cooperate with its allies on critical infrastructure security and development, particularly with regards to sensitive and regulated sectors like nuclear power and rare earth metals development. 

In summary; buy Cameco, buy Flour, invest in a secure and prosperous future for the North American continent. Don't let China's SOEs take over the world. They're not here to help your businesses, they're here to get leverage over critical infrastructure and resources in your economy to secure long-term commodity supplies for the Chinese state.  Kind of like the East India Company, minus the wigs... and funny hats... they probably have some mercenaries though (or PMCs under contract but there's not a huge difference).",The combined case for Cameco (NYSE:CCJ / TSX:CCO) and Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR),0.63,1614880437,_count_dooku
