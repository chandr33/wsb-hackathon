31,m1gmxd,"Check my wall for other updates &amp; DD, but this is simply in reference to what is happening this week and what DID happen this week.

1. DDTC proposed a new Rule that Willow allow them to charge Borrowing Interest and demand payment DAILY (Currently they only have to pay interest on shorted positions after expiration). This means the pain of stalling a short would be felt daily. This happened late on Friday and we weren't sure how it would effect the markets Monday, though most of us thought it would help....and it sure did.

2. GME had a massive update with Ryan Cohen leading a restructuring. When GME squeezes, we squeezes. This news showed that GME wasn't going away and people wanted in on the new big squeeze ($AMC)

3. Earlier it was announced theaters in L.A could open as early as next week.

3.5....^^^^ If they open a week from now it would be the same time period earnings come out which will serve as a catalyst. 

4. Earnings will show a Reconsolidation of debt and massive amounts of cash with great Management that will show the strength of $AMC and discuss their future pursuits. 

Add those two on top of each other (Succesful Earnings report + reopening LA) and we get a massive bump.

5. We popped $10 today. That means a lot of calls are ITM (In The Money). If we can finish this week at $15 the amount of calls ITM is in the multiple millions which forces a major buy next week, or FTDs and increased Borrowing Interest.

6. Quadruple witching next Friday. Look it up. 4 forms of contracts and expirations all at the same time. Add all of this together with this week ending in a huge success and we are 🚀 🌙",$GME $AMC Updating Catalysts and When Squeezes Collide,1.0,1615324808,Ciricath

37,m1gnbg,"The case for PLTR!

What does it do?
Many investors in PLTR have no idea what the company actually does to make money. Putting it as simply as I can the company creates software for companies to analyse data and create simulations which help companies or governments make decisions which will help them strategies. For example they take all the data regarding COVID infections and help governments predict how it might spread which will allow them to distribute vaccines to the areas that will reduce the spread of the virus the most.

Financials
The company should be profitable either in 2021 2022. In 2020 the company had a one off cost of almost $1 billion for stock based compensation for its employees. The companies revenues are increasing 30% year over year and the losses are decreasing every year. When it does become profitable the profits will increase rapidly. As CEO Alex Karp has explained their has been a wide divergence between the Revenues and costs which is typical with tech companies that need to spend a large amount of money in the beginning for product development and make large profit margins once they have a working product. The revenues are currently at just over a $1 billion dollars with a loss of $1.17 billion in 2020 however when you look at the reason for this it’s mainly because selling and admin costs aswell as research and development. Now what needs to be understood about the financials of Palantir is that although there is a divergence in revenues and costs there is not and with the product and systems they currently have there will not be in the future a scenario where there cost of revenues are flat and the revenues increase. This is because the software has to be adapted to each of its customers which requires time and money. That being said the company currently has a gross profit margin of 75% and considering the average customer pays $7 million this is not concerning at all.

Technology or Consulting Firm
As explained above the company does need to personalise its software based on the customers needs and the cost of revenues are not flat however I don’t think you can reasonably argue this is a consulting firm. The company may need to personalise its software for each customer for its commercial clients but this is just an set up fee and from then on the company is making large profit margins. With its government clients I’m assuming their is very little personalisation to the software that is needed and they can simply input the same variable data that previous government agencies have inputted and run there simulations if they are looking for the answer to the same question for example what areas should we distribute the COVID vaccine to first?

The End Game!
Palantir is a long play for me. In the short term this company could go up to 40 or back down to 15. Any lower and I’m selling my house to buy as much as I can. But as Alex Karp said over the long term he thinks Palantir will be one of the most important technology companies in the world and its long term share holders will benefit greatly. This reminded so much of Jeff Bezos back in 1999 talking about Amazon’s long term view. I think Palantir is a great company over the long term and in 10 years time I think the share price will be at least $250 based on its growth rate.

I welcome any criticism of my analysis, I know it’s not a complete analysis but if I were to do that I’d be here all day. I think I’ve included the most important points anyway.

Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATOS), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need with a current focus on breast cancer and COVID-19, announces updated findings following 26 months of Expanded Access (or “compassionate use”) single-patient studies of Atossa’s Endoxifen.


Breast Cancer Treatment : Endoxifen has the potential to work in all three areas of the Breast Cancer Paradigm: to mitigate breast cancer risk (by reducing the density of breast tissue); to reduce the cancer cell activity before surgery; and to reduce the risk of recurrent or new breast cancer after the initial treatment. We have developed a proprietary Topical Endoxifen formulation for transdermal delivery (meaning it can be applied by the patient directly to the skin like a lotion), and have completed randomized, double-blinded, 3-dose level Phase 1 study of its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in 24 healthy female and 24 male volunteers.  These studies showed. There were no clinically significant safety signals and no clinically significant adverse events in participants receiving topical Endoxifen.

Bonus: Based on substantially positive results achieved with the patients enrolled to date in its Australian open-label Phase 2 clinical study of oral Endoxifen administered in the “window of opportunity” between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery, Atossa has halted the study and is accelerating its Endoxifen program in the United States.

The ticker ATOS hit a SP of $4.9 early last month after the news of advancing their trials for Endoxifen. The SP is now trading at below $3 and has potential to hit $10+ once confirmation comes about either clinical trials.
