So I have a short position on E-mini expiring next week.  
The position is currently a loss, but because this is a hedge position for my other portfolio, I don't mind the loss and want to keep this position until the market seems to be stable again.

My question is this - if I roll my (losing) short position to June, will my current loss be closed out and become permanent (settled?) or will it give it another 3 months w/o making the current loss permanent.

The people of the subreddits that have followed GME closely for the past months are visitors to the same pub who have zero quarrel with each other and slam their pitchers ever so often and smile and laugh, while calling each other autist and retard without the offense. When someone disagrees, it sometimes happens they get kicked out of the pub, but most often they're slapped on the head and there's some banter and joking.

Now, this transparency, this sense of brotherhood in the pub while everyone is hitting the pub on their own is what an ideal market needs. People looking to make money backed by their own research (or lack of it) and not people trying to scam others out of money by spreading rumours and using shady tactics.

Transparency. Brotherhood. Banter without offense.

The big funds and market makers do their own kind of goofy and fraternial shit, but they keep it hidden and place themselves above the rest. They agree on shady tactics to beat up others so they get the better hand, while the odds are ever in their favour. 

This behaviour ruins the market.

The market needs transparency and fun. A workplace that has you sweating at times, but at the end of the day everyone goes home satisfied and with a smile on their face.

What a god damn close. Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful retards who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.

Thank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.

Let's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.

We are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.

Hourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  
Bollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  
Monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  
4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  
Bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.

Daily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  
Bollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  
4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  
This is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.

Weekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  
Bollinger bands are still wide.  
Our first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.

The top 6 funds holding BB based from [https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb) have all added to their positions in the last month. Hit ctrl + F and find them on [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb) if you want to see. Don't just take my word for it, I'm retarded. DYOD.

Monthly: Fuck you. Not relevant right now. Shut up.

Every whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.

Options baby, taken from [http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb](http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb) for March 19th, 2021.

Total Open Interest Calls: 198,238  
Total Open Interest Puts: 59,407

Put/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.

The highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  
The highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.

Do I see 8 happening next week? No, I really don't. Are opinions like assholes, everyone has one.  
Could we close at $10 next week? Absolutely possible. We have signs that we could go in either direction.  
Max pain next week is $9. Should be easy, but so is yo momma.

My thoughts for next week? I don't fucking know. I don't have a crystal ball god damn it. Fuck off.

If I was a magician, I'd say it would be green. About the same % as this week but I have confirmation bias and I also beat my dick to Kim Possible when I was a teenager. Your guess is as good as mine, but I digress. Lots of signals to go either direction.

This is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of what's happening and the opinion of a degenerate. I love lamp.

69,m3sw1q,"I am a child of the '80s. I 'm not currently a gamer, but it was my life until my late teens in the mid '90s. 

This GME and even WSB as a whole feels like a continuation of the gaming community. We help each other out. My confirmation bias tells me that the code has been cracked - the financial system that was designed to serve only the wealthy has now been solved. Thank you DFV and other in this subreddit for sharing info and bringing novices like myself in to better understand how this system works.

For example: If a friend hadn't shown me how to beat Mike Tyson in Punch-Out in the late '80s, I would probably have never been able to. He was INVINCIBLE! But - someone had figured it out, passed the tip on to a friend, and so on, and so on, until it reached me. When I finally knocked out Tyson, I was ecstatic. I then passed the info on to other friends and family - and watched them beat him as well. It was a great feeling, helping someone succeed and get past something that seemed insurmountable.

Video game consoles were our babysitters and companions. Regardless of color, ethnic, or socioeconomic background, we all connected through gaming. Many parents were too busy working 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet. That was our reality. Gaming wasn't about making money - it was about working as a collective (whether we knew it or not) to beat the game. We're on the cusp of beating this level of life - and only YOU know what level you're on. Is GME meant to get you on your feet after a shit year? Or to bring you financial independence? Or to help your local hospital? YOU get to decide that. However, we're working as a collective to beat the system. 

Scotty from Star Trek once said something to the effect of ""the more complicated a system is, the easier it is to take it down.""

This is that system. The market is a black box - complicated by design to discourage outsiders. Most of our parents didn't dabble in the stock market. If they did, they used fiduciaries or investors.

For those of you who say ""I'm in it for me, I am not here to be a SJW"" or something to that effect, I understand. It's OK. We'll take your help for as far as you can give. Someone else will take your place. For me, I am not going to pull up the ladder. I am hopefully going to cover my investment little by little, and then hang tight so that I don't leave others hanging. I want them to have a chance to take some financial control. But, that's just me. You do you.

Last point: We used to take multi-day road trips when I was a kid in the '80s. One time we stopped in at a remote gas station. There was an arcade video game machine (Double Dragon, maybe?). Someone had deposited at least $100 in credits and left them there for whoever came through (or the owner rigged the machine, but I don't think that's what happened.) I couldn't believe my luck! I played a couple of games and then added a couple quarters to help the next person who found the machine. Decades later, I still think of that machine and of the tiny little generosities we find every day.

P.S. - For those of you who say, ""this is a Wendy's""...well, I WORKED AT WENDY'S. Once I sliced my left wrist open with a box cutter when opening a carton of fries. I could see the bone inside my arm and all the veins around it. It was insane. My manager made me leave for the hospital by going through the dining room. My arm was streaming blood as I passed families dining on their Taco Salads and Doubles with cheese. I am however, craving a bowl of chili as I write this.

United Wholesale Mortgage is an amazing buy that I think has both long term and short term potential. I will admit, I don't know a lot about stocks, but when I look at USMC I see value town for days. I wouldn't call this DD because I just googled stuff.   


**Who Is UWMC and What Do They Do?**

UWMC underwrites loans for brokers, banks, and credit unions. They do it all- FHA, Conventional, VA, the works. Their primary business however seems to be with brokers. Now what is a mortgage broker? No really I had to google this to get a better understanding. Mortgage brokers essentially take your info, screen it, and then look at the variety of home loan options available to you and aim to get you the best deal in return (usually) for a small fee. Mortgage brokers currently make up a little over 20% of the housing market vs. 7% 2011 and 16% in 2019. They essentially help people find the best deal on the market to help finance their home, and seem to be popular among millennial homebuyers. With mortgage brokers shares growing in the mortgage space this gives UWM great growth potential (I think).   


**What is UWMC's Edge?**

Now what differentiates them from other companies? Well one is their fast turnaround times. UWMC proprietary tech that allows for the quickest turnaround time in the market due to streamlined efficiency. That tech alone makes them convenient for the broker and home buyer. This makes the loan process insanely fast vs their competitors who can take a longer time to close the deal. They've built strong relations within the broker community and appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the brokers they work with.   


**UWMC Ultimatum**

There's been a lot of speculation over that Chad Ishbia's ultimatum to the brokers- sign the addendum by 03/15 saying you will halt working with Fairway and RKT. Well 90% of their brokers signed it, so I think this narrative is overplayed quite a bit. Like I said, UWMC and brokers work together to profit in a symbiotic fashion. Brokers are the face and voice you see UWM directs them traffic, they each get a cut, both walk away happy with fast turnaround times/best deal for their customers. According to UWMC, RKT has gone out of their way to bypass broker's. RKT is better off offering them a rate, bypass the broker, make more money cutting out the middle man (I may be under simplifying this or have it wrong). Rocket Mortgage is not interested in working with individual brokers when they have an in house team to help keep it all in the family.   


**The Value Short Term**  


Short term I think we have a few key things coming up.    


* [u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/user/faisall1/) is convinced there's a short squeeze, if you wanna see his DD on that it's \[here\]&lt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc\_part\_4\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc_part_4_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing/)\&gt;. I hope this is why I've been getting fed red crayons. 
* Addendum Deadline is 03/15, looks like a majority of brokers have agreed which at the very minimum shouldn't hurt their bottom line. Looks like a win-win for the UWM-Broker channel
* Russell 1000/3000 Addition on 03/22
* Q1 Earnings Report after destroying their Q4 numbers. Housing volume Remains low, demand remains high. Despite Treasury Yield + Mortgage Rate Increase I think we're gonna see good numbers here. Also I like dividends. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Long Term Value** 

The individual broker is not going away, UWM has made quick turnaround times standard for brokers and homebuyers increasing the speed and quality of service you get from an individual broker. The growth of the broker sector is a positive for both homebuyers and UWM, I like my quarterly dividends, and the stock is just way too undervalued here. Every analysis I see online has a target price of $11\~$13, so it's at a discount at $8.30 right now. UWM has rock solid financials. UWMC has a PE of 6.17 and PS of 3.84 vs. RKT with a PE 2.06 and a PS of 8.46. Look, I'm not the smartest guy, but I can clearly see that UWM has a distinct edge in the home loan market. I think UWM has a wide valuation between $11\~$16 in a fair market all things equal.   


I took my tendies and yeeted them all into UWMC. 374 share and x3 $9 calls 05/21.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR UWM has been feeding me red crayons, but I feel like it's gonna give me green ones soon. I like dividends because I'm big boomer.",Why UWMC has Value in Both the Long and Short Term,1.0,1615588565,LocalNative15

87,m3t1dc,"Holy shit, this week passed by so fast. Honestly was hoping for it to be a bit longer. (Insert That's what she said joke here).

For those who are new, within the past 3 weeks, we've went from ~$40 and closed today at $264.50. Fucking absolute WIN.

So what if the squeeze didn't happen today? Despite the media blackouts, Jim Cramer going AWOL, and Market Watch reboot of ""That's So Raven!"" GME is still up. Celebrate a little for those who double or tripled down when it was at $40 and everyone was implying that it was going to crash. Biggest fucking ""I TOLD YOU SO"" ever.

So relax for the weekend and get ready for Monday. Because I guarantee you shit is going to hit the fan, what date and time? Idk, you'll have to ask Market Watch for that but all I can say is I'm hodling my shares and I'm determined as fuck to make a shit ton of money.
