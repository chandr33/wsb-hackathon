5,lxyh8u,"Why the hell have some stocks been exploding lately? I don't fucking know but I do have an idea:

1. Low-Medium market Cap (Means it can move quickly) | $ASO is at 3.07B ✔️
2. High short interest (The retards love this number) | $ASO is at 35-45% interest ✔️
3. Steady bull price action | $ASO 13.06$ -&gt; 25.66$ fairly steady increase over the last 6 months ✔️
4. Sudden volume pressure | $ASO volume has doubled recently, compared to 10 day average ✔️
5. Has some kind of meme-able feature | $ASO sells guns in Texas. Texans will literally shoot anyone who doesn't invest in this stock. ✔️
6. It has begun to gain traction on WSB but has not yet exploded  ✔️

I'mma call this the Himmel-Index or the Him-dex. I literally have no qualifications and I'm just a ape pointing at bumps in a stock. I just happen to be accidentally printing money. 🦍📈

Here are some other apes who happen to be on the same page as me:

* [The ONLY DD You Need on ACADEMY SPORTS + OUTDOORS $ASO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxoxsq/the_only_dd_you_need_on_academy_sports_outdoors/)
* [DD: ASO 🚀🚀🚀GME fuel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx5epa/dd_aso_gme_fuel/)
* [$ASO DD Criminally Undervalued](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwybmb/aso_dd_criminally_undervalued/)

Positions: I was busy losing money buying $TGT calls today, so I haven't bought yet. But I am looking to purchase calls tomorrow. I think this one is still early and tomorrow could be a good opportunity. I'm mainly looking at 3/19 25$ and 4/16 25$.

Disclaimer: Again I don't know shit about stocks, I just like guns.

Edit: After thoughts, I'm going to watch how much traction this gains as-well as the dips tomorrow to determine if I want to buy or not.

Edit2: Lmao this isn't looking good for me so far.",Watch out for $ASO tomorrow; it has potential 🎯,0.71,1614900619,dick_himmel

As the value of that dollar has diminished! We now have to brace ourselves for deflation! This is the only solution the reserve banks have when they need to strengthen the Dollar! And we are seeing this right now! Go look at the DXY it is going up and Gold is going down signalling deflation!                            

We are already seeing a spike in the USD which is causing stock market to tumble, this fall will cause a crash that none of us had to endure in our life time.

Jerome Powell just came out yesterday and is saying they will continue to stimulate the economy, this would be good if it wasn’t a trap and the markets are reflecting they aren’t buying this bluff! You are seeing all the signs of deflation, oil up, gold down, stocks down.
