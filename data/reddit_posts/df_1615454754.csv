\---- DD: The A3-5 event \----

with all of This call pacing Slowly unwinding over the past few Weeks. I have Been Looking for a Direction/ Reason for the slow movement with Heavy resistance/investment to not trigger the Gamma Squeeze prematurely.

we have been hitting \~10k calls Daily. and today we were about to hit the big ones at 300 and 350. [u/Doovstar's Call options DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1mh01/dd_call_options_gme_friday_31221/). but we got nuked down. ( and it only delayed GME's progress by 4 hours)

as far as I can tell GME is Slowly Being unwound to hit a Target Date. and I think I found it.

MARCH 19th and Guess what is being Implemented on that delightful Friday.

SR-NSCC-2021-801 (you can google it its a PDF download)

Clearing houses are changing their Rules for Liquidity requirements for call options ( CALCULATED DAILY). Specifically for ""Supplemental Liquidity Deposits"" over 2 billion. they are letting institutions Leverage the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations based on a proportional spread.

* Current Rules (4a) Page 7
* Amended Rule (4a) Page 8
* Page 11 for the Breakdown for a spread.  
\-they just had to use the word ""Never""
* page 19 for Implementation timeframe.  
\-Note the file advance notice at the bottom (File No. SR-NSCC-2021-002 )

[https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices)  
you can either go to page 5 for **march 5th** or search: ""a8974"" for the notification.

**Basically: SR-NSCC-2021-801 may be in effect on the 18th and Very Well May enable the GME to MOAS and not break the entire Market.**

I have spent the entire day mulling over on who is Driving this thing to the 18th. and I have come to the conclusion that it does not matter, there is not much I can do other than enjoy the ride.

800$ by the 18th. I am Calling it.

me and my 11 GME @ 200$ avg will be waiting.

ps.

I might as well Bet. If I am wrong. I will Delete my reddit account. but if I am right. I would like a flair or somethin",My Last GME DD: SR-NSCC-801,1.0,1615455042,Blackboxeq

38,m2mk0s,"I have been flagging dilution at AMC before and I want to touch on this further in this DD. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 1.	AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone. 

This is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:** 

From the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves) 

Which I estimate is another 6m. 

	Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x 

	And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)

&amp;#x200B;

# 2.	Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares. 

They have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come. 

And … here it comes: 

The company just filed an AGM to increase the share count by another 500m. 

See this link: 

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)

# Operationally it’s a severely struggling business: 

\-	The company burned through 125m a month in Q4

\-	That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call. 

\-	They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast

\-	Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent

\-	Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today’s share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution – pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD 

\-	Remember AMC wasn’t even able to generate any cash pre- covid

\-	The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# There is not even that much squeeze potential: 

**Lets look at the facts:** 

**1.	Stocks shorted 55.5m ??**

That is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float…. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume. 

Stock is liquid to borrow

&amp;#x200B;

[short interest](https://preview.redd.it/mcxmz3axcdm61.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4389212874246a5a3b16c5d566ba524dee51237b)

&amp;#x200B;

**2.	But what about a gamma squeeze ???**

&amp;#x200B;

Again lets look at the facts.

The open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts. 

Lets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don’t exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares… 

Many of these calls are out of the money.. 

But hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money. 

That is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!

Also this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.

More realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls. 

This is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there. 

The reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

[look at open interest.. taken from bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/4jpza7kzcdm61.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b114e468f96ccd7f3ca4af15214bd016a35c09a)

39,m2mk3l,"Despite all the hype and fuckery going on there is one aspect that's feels concerning - at least to me. Everyone seems to wish death, homelesness and other horrible things to the HFs once the situation clears up.

Now don't understand me wrong. I get it. If these HFs had the chance to weasel out of this and throwing millions (potentially) of peoples lives under the bus... they wouldn't hesitate. Call me naive, but I don't think they are doing this to damage other people. They were raised to be like this. They were educated to be like this. To them this is most likely nothing but a game. A game with horrible consequences for the losers. And they may even be psychopaths / sociopaths literally living in their cocaine infused psychosis of a world world that they were a part of creating it in the first place. They have insane mental illnesses.

But we are better than that. The community here is so amazing and caring about others. You have people struggling to buy real food. Some other people instantly gifted them money to help out in difficult times. One other person (don't remember the user, sorry) didn't have the cash to take care of a loved one that left him/her/whatever suits you - another person jumped in and sent money without hesitating. 

We have empathy, we have conpassion.
The HFs know nothing of those characteristics.

Again, call me naive, but I do not wish death or other horrible things upon them. Lock them out of the market, punish them reasonably. Treat them. Make them understand what horrible things to other people  they have done in 2008 and before and after that. Absoluteley don't let them get away unscathed, ever. If they can't understand what they have done, if they show no remorse at all - lock them away forever. We have the chance to learn a lot from these people and their sick world so we can possibly prevent future disasters.

As a famous green alien once said: ""Hate leads to suffering.""

Do not hate your enemy, because that makes you blind. Don't give in to the hype of crucifying them.

Boom, it's 11:30 market time, shares going up and up and up, MMs panicking to hedge for all the retarded (and beautiful) OTM calls.  Shares are literally exponentially increasing in price.  From where I sat, I saw a drop in price, trade halt, and then looking at the level 2 data, OBNOXIOUS amounts of ask prices at the lowest I've seen in weeks.

In their minds ""retail noobs have probably never seen a trading halt, they see this, price tanks, flood with sells, they sell, we can cover a little to make up for losses, and maybe our OTM puts can be salvaged.""

**What is the Short-Sale Rule?** \- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)  
Explanation by  u/Kentuckychickennow

&gt;Tis means that GME can't be shorted on a leg down ( i.e. when it's already red) but can only be shorted its a leg up ( when it's green).  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier, the shorts were pulling the stock down by shorting on an already down leg ( already red), which started to look like a everyone was selling.  
&gt;  
&gt;This trick was extensively used by MM's ( also referred to as a short ladder attack ) to create panic and get everyone to sell.  
&gt;  
&gt;To a level that, if people had limit sells, these steep price declines would hit those limits and you would wake up next morning with no GME.",GME is on the NYSE short sale restriction list. 💎✋🚀,1.0,1615456600,Ienpw

94,m2mtgi,"Not the usual stock I think you might see here. Listed on the London Stock Exchange. Came to my attention last night after seeing it there for literally 1.39 pence per share. Doesn’t pay a dividend. Has fallen dramatically over the last couple of years. At its height trading for around £1.25. Company has had financial issues  and restructuring. All Information points to a particularly bleak outlook for the company as a whole. Debt etc. Yet, I just spent £140 inc fees on 9838 shares. Why...

They own one of the biggest mines in the world that is the source of rare blue diamonds.
They recently sold a 299 carat diamond for 12.8 million.
They have restructured the company, cashed notes etc to give value going forward.
And they at one point traded around £1.25. If they even gain a small percentage of this back the return will be worth it. Let alone if they managed to pull it back up to £1.25 a share.
It’s £140 that I don’t mind loosing on a very very precarious bet.

I am I mad. Probably. The balance sheets doesn’t exactly look amazing. But it’s a very very small investment that might....maybe....give me somewhat of an okay return at some point....if they hit it big in one of their mines and the demands for diamonds goes back up after the whole Covid thing is over.

I should note I am not telling anyone to invest or giving  any kind of financial advice here. Just sharing something I personally considered worth a laugh if it ever came in. I realise it probably won’t and there’s a good chance this company will go under but what the hell...it’s £140. Interestingly though doing the math. At this price you can buy all available shares for about 350k.
