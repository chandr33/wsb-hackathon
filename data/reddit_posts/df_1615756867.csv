13,m54nsj,"The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund Challenge.  AMC  GME  RKT

SO, in case you have not been following along, a lot of apes have been donating to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. You all are amazing. Great forward thinking retards, But that gave me an idea. (please note Dian has no E at the end. They already placed Apes Together Strong on their home page here:

[https://gorillafund.org/](https://gorillafund.org/)

I'll be live streaming today, to push this challenge at 2:00 Pacific with some AMC &amp; GME &amp; RKT DD, to go along with Futures opening.

CHALLENGE LISTED TOWARDS BOTTOM OF THE POST.

Are you with me?

Do you dare to be different?

Do you dare to help a great cause?

So here's what I did.  I donated $500 to get a plaque on their wall and covered the fees. (They also have a $1000 option for apes more retarded than I). This plaque is going directly to the fund, and should help a lot of gorilla's.  They have been building a headquarters named the

## The Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund

Buy Plaque Here.

[https://gorillafund.org/become-a-gorilla-champion/](https://gorillafund.org/become-a-gorilla-champion/)

&amp;#x200B;

I also bought a t-shirt for $25, which you can get here. (some sizes already sold out, I got grey)

[https://store.gorillafund.org/collections/all](https://store.gorillafund.org/collections/all)

&amp;#x200B;

So here is what I am going to do.

1. ...If AMC Goes to $20 a share, I will donate $5000 of US Dollars or equivalent AMC Stock to their giving fund.  If I am able donate stock without diluting the value, I won't have to sell any shares to do so. Important note. I will provide proof of donation on stream and in a thread. \*

2)...If AMC Goes to $50 a share, I will donate $10,000 of US Dollars or equivalent AMC Stock to their giving fund. If I am able donate stock without diluting the value, I won't have to sell any shares to do so. Important note. I will provide proof of donation on stream and in a thread. \*

3)...If AMC Goes to $100 a share, I will donate $50,000 of US Dollars or equivalent AMC Stock to their giving fund. If I am able donate stock without diluting the value, I won't have to sell any shares to do so. Important note. I will provide proof of donation on stream and in a thread. \*

4)...If AMC Goes to $500 or $1000 a share, I have no idea what I will do. But I told my kids I will fly all of us to their grand opening of the Ellen DeGeneres Campus  in Summer or Fall of 2021 when they open to go see the plaques and drop off another check.\*

[https://gorillafund.org/get-involved/planned-giving/](https://gorillafund.org/get-involved/planned-giving/)

So the challenge,

1)...What will you do, or what have you done to help this cause. You have an opportunity to go along for the ride, and help out a great cause.

Caviat: Pick a charity of your choice. Doesn't have to be gorilla's. My main one tied to my amazon is The Semper Fi Fund out of Camp Pendleton California helping not only Marine Corps Veterans but all veterans. And they have just about the top charity navigator score you can have.

My ask.

List your goals, could be 1 share or $5, $10, $20, whatever you want. If you adopted an ape, list it, link it, let;'s have fun. If you are choosing a stock like GME or RKT or any other stock, go for it, I encourage it.

\*Retarded Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, if you do any of this you will lose 100%. Things that will prevent me from following through. If I decide I am a paper hands B. I am long AMC in both stock and options. I am long RKT. Seriously don't do this, you will lose everything and your mom's boyfriend will only take her and the kids away bouncing you into a cardboard box to live.

But please donate what you can to whatever cause you choose. It's a noble thing to do.

35,m54uow,"It‚Äôs time. I don‚Äôt like to put time stamps on tendies, but the inevitable is here. The facts are lining up. Bare with me because I‚Äôm doing this in my phone while I‚Äôm visiting my wife‚Äôs boyfriend parents for the first time. I‚Äôm just too excited to see this play out.

Not financial advise. I eat crayons..green crayons only, I don‚Äôt like how the others taste. 

My plays this week are GME, RKT, and PLTR for a few reasons listed below. 

First, Psychology of the masses. I‚Äôm big on facts and psychology within the market (yes, not the economy). I‚Äôm not smart enough to do DDs like some of these apes so I collect their facts, crossed check them with my beliefs, and match them to facts/psychology. 

They are failing because we aren‚Äôt listening to them. Sentiment is very high relative to the action the past few trading days. Thursday and Friday consisted of two things in my opinion: 1) hedgies decay long calls to induce selling prior to EOM. 2) consolidation of recent squeezes prior to bigger squeezes on the way. 

I tripled up calls because the idiots allowed for calls at a discount on Friday. 

Second, Undervalued, highly shorted companies are looking very bullish because we like the stock. Here is a great DD article explaining this in detail. Shoutout to the author (sorry I‚Äôm on my phone so it‚Äôs too much to check names). There are cup and handles everywhere, resistance that came support, and stocks are priming to retest previous highs and possibly blow through them. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/m37o70/memeageddon_part_2_march_19th_witching_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Third, spy and Vixx correlation. Here‚Äôs a link the the article explaining this. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4odqq/spy_400_technical_analysis_for_the_week_ahead_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Last time bears won and kept Vix above $20. This time I don‚Äôt believe they will...too much money coming into the market and too many bullish flags. In short Vixx below 20 means the market is going to moon. 

Fourth, short sale restriction for TD on RKT and GME. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

What sticks out to me is that RKT has been trading like snails for the past week. It‚Äôs also down 50% since the squeeze. It‚Äôs been hammered down. TDA states they are restricting short selling due to current market conditions. This article was released 4pm market close on Friday..there was essentially no volume for the last two days so what market conditions are they taking about? Everything seems fine to the boomer eyes. Not us apes though. They also specifically mentioned that some 03/19 call buying could be restricted. Check the open interest on these stocks for OTM calls too. So much volume. Also RKT had 10 million large order volume in 03/10. Institutions are selling this stock as f13 reports have shown, they only added.

Gme is Gme man. Not much to say other than hodl and get a free ticket to the moon. Calls are expensive though so I‚Äôm holding shares. I loaded up on RKT because that stocks fucking moves due to the small float. We could be surprised with a $100 price test this month. I also bought PLTR calls for similar bullish chart technicals as RKT. Time to retest highs since support was found at previous resistance levels. It‚Äôs all flagging. 

What to expect? Hedgies could have one last trick in the bag so don‚Äôt get scared. Monday could possible be a trick to get us to think we were bamboozled. I don‚Äôt think they can keep the volume down though because I‚Äôm sure they anticipate us yoloing our stimis. Combine our stimis with institutions participating...shorts are going to get wrecked...maybe margin called...and they really start to cry. Meanwhile we‚Äôll save a few thousand more wild animals. I‚Äôm in this to become a millionaire. You apes ready?

TDLR: I can feel the desperation of hedgies. The facts are all lining up for us the be VERY rich. A feel a correction coming for undervalued stocks to be correctly valued in the majority perspective. It might be an all week rally. I have to go to a destination wedding this week in the Caribbean. Normally I would be excited, but I won‚Äôt blow this opportunity so I told my wife to her boyfriend instead.

63,m552s9,"I see a lot of people donating to wildlife foundations and I think its virtuous and amazing. Right now, a small radio station based in Jersey City, WFMU, is in the midst of its fundraising marathon. This station and this subreddit share the same ethos: an institution free of corporate meddling and all about sticking it to the man. There‚Äôs no commercials, no corporate sponsorship; what you hear is 100% straight from the DJ.

Check out [Wfmu.org/pledge](https://pledge.wfmu.org/donate) and consider making a one-time donation, or sign up for ‚ÄúSwag for Life‚Äù- a monthly payment as little as $10/month, and you get some cool swag (shirt, bumpersticker, etc.)

Seriously, this is a noble non-profit radio station, and if you take the time to check out what exactly it is, you‚Äôll find that it defies all logic to running a business, and should not exist in today‚Äôs world, sort of like the state of GME rn.

It‚Äôs goal this year is to raise $1.5 million and all the money goes into the costs of running a radio station- from the transmitters to heating the station‚Äôs headquarters. Since it‚Äôs a not-for-profit, all donations are tax a write-off!

Long story short, check out WFMU and consider giving a piece of your tendies to a similar cause (WFMU actually loves what we‚Äôre doing at WSB). To tell you the truth, I‚Äôm just a huge fan of the station, and they need help right now.

I really love where this is going with all the Animal support recently. Taking from the hedgies and giving to Mother Nature, big LIKE! 

I would like to draw the attention to the zoos in your city. If you want to support monkey business, you don‚Äôt need to look in the other side of the world.
Please don‚Äòt get me wrong here, I really understand organizations like these and they totally earn to be supported. In fact, zoos are nowadays something like the donation collectors for all kinds of natural protection programs all around the world.

But there are animals right in your neighborhood, which can use your help also. Zoos are really getting in trouble these days (the big bad C...) because of missing visitors. Still, the animals are hungry and need to be taken care of. Donations to zoos are mandatory for their survival, they also offer sponsorships for their animals, starting from 20 bucks! DK, Bowser and Sonic will thank you ;) Remember the first time seeing a monkey outside the bathroom? Realizing there is  wildlife that lives outside the city and getting in touch with it?
