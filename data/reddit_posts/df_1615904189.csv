35,m6a6iq,"TLDR; $DS is an undervalued reopening play that is likely to triple in the next 6 months. Ape buy $DS and ape get more banana. 

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack? A stock under $4 that could easily triple in the next 6 months. Read on my fellow YOLOers. DS owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf. Shares in $DS have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added even as you read this.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&amp;iid=4040318) 

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2zmdb6opcen61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42c51ec5c07793525cf9095a7e35f3c33d23ce2f

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utdcyjvwcen61.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c134457a45808865e829797d23becc3b9caa5c6

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the DS Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and DS venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9wgwhr89den61...*

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company (ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what $DS is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into $DS. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&amp;P to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up $DS in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. 

# How High Can She Go?

Real high mother fucker. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ynh7tyiden61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8b21f69458dea5d258fb6896048e1fb394c85c

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own $DS – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. That’s right ape. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going to moon? No you wouldn’t dummy. But you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will only accelerate. 

Realistically the market cap for $DS could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and DS venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&amp;A target as the market cap grows.** The market is forward looking and it will begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a $DS share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of shit. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? Those fuckers are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at it like your mom at the club. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory, like your shit stains do after several washes. 

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's (DS) earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.** 

# Upcoming earnings

The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their DS locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering $DS:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/03094r9xden61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dfc234f4491bece3a964d004fa1f38e3c2e4a82

 Now let’s compare that to ELY (Topgolf):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/52jj74u0een61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6567535b89bdc14b43946434c0aa8b011cff167e

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than $DS. Overtime, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on $DS and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current price target for $DS is $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on $DS will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

$DS is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

37,m6a6kw,"'M AN IDIOT. THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

Here is today's Open Interest Report and Total Exposure for weeks with significant open interest as of market open and based on Friday's closing price of 220.14. (OI data is not real time; we only know OI after close).

Posting here for the first time. If you like it (and it doesn't get blocked), I'll continue posting here as well as my other board. For the background of this post and all of the weaknesses of this stupid analysis, scroll down to the end.

\* \* \*

For all open contracts at close of business yesterday and yesterday's closing price of 220.14, total exposure decreased to **$2.546 billion** down from $3.084 billion yesterday. 87% of that exposure is tied up in the options shown in the Figures and Tables expiring Friday ($925 million), 4/16 ($691 million), 7/16 ($306 million), and 1/21/22 ($288 million). *See* Figure 1 and Table 1.

In terms of actual shares needed to cover short options that are in the money, our hypothetical single actor will need to find **11.5 million** shares of GME (or their equivalents) to cover their positions across all open ITM positions. This is approximately 21% of the float of GME and 16% of all shares outstanding. *See* Figure 2 and Table 2. This is down from 14.8 million shares needed to cover yesterday.

LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:

This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?

Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.

Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.

Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",3/16/2021 GME Open Interest Report,1.0,1615904565,Unlucky_Falcon1754

83,m6acdh,"Fellow retards  
Every time i feel close to pulling the trigger, something total retarded happens that really bums me the f out and stops me from selling.

The first time in the run up, i was getting ready to sell when suddenly they stopped buying on the stock for a lot of people.

Well, then there was a downward spiral where, faster than i could see, I was in the red again.  
Now, i still thought that there was something there worth holding for and even buying.

So come the second rise of GME and I'm getting ready to sell at approximately 100% gains and was just waiting for the stock's climb up to come to a halt to sell on the decline. Well, the decline was a 40% drop coming out of nowhere and got me really suspicious again about what the f is actually going on right now. 

The next few days, the stock seems to stagnate, but gains a bit of momentum, only to lose it again the last few days.

And then comes the wave of red and without anything actually happening (no news on GME or anything really) the stock drops 10-20% a day.

Now In hindsight, it's really easy to pick out dates where one should've sold, but in reality, I have no idea what to do.

My Exit strategies (that I've planned) where all missed by a few percentages and therefore I am here again, looking for advise on how to play this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

I only invested what i can afford to lose, so there's no problem there, I explicitly use this as kind of a learning experience, but I'm not learning shit tbh. This truly seems like an ape's stock as it just has a live of it's own and does whatever without making any sense.

What are your stances on quitting gme, what are you planning for? 

Did you (partially) close your positions already?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Diamond hands stronk, can not un-diamond ... what do?

Option addicts listen up. GME shares are too pricey, stick to buying shares! I think I found a way to make money off GME without selling my GME shares, obviously to buy more GME. I’ve been doing some research before my stimmy hits and hear me out. I think the shorts hedged with the XRT ETF from the start OR are starting to do so, the charts are almost identical. After going down this rabbit hole this is what I’m doing, for every 4 GME shares i buy Im buying 1 XRT call. (XRT calls are cheaper than GME calls) After taking profits from the XRT call, I’m buying more GME or doing the 4 to 1 ration again. Do NOT yolo on XRT calls,that is betting against yourself! It has to be at the least a 4 to 1 ratio for it to work as an infinite money glitch. If the shorts can hedge with XRT to minimize their losses then retail can use XRT to maximize their profits OKAY! How do you like that Cramer? LMAO. My rabbit hole lead me to uncover that GME is the main holding in the XRT ETF, the charts are almost identical. Led me to believe that as the shorts lose on GME, they minimize loses by profiting on XRT. Do NOT yolo on XRT calls, that is betting against yourself, do that 4 to 1 ratio OR just strictly buy GME shares. 

This is not financial advice I’m just a young girl from Bulgaria. JK apes, I just like the stock and think Roaring Kitty and daddy Cohen are sexyAF! 

TDLR: HODL your GME shares like lottery tickets. For every 4 GME shares you buy, buy 1 XRT call, then rinse and repeat. Do NOT yolo on XRT calls, that is betting against yourself.

I just woke up, and I had a really crazy and real dream about GME, I never have dreams about irl stuff, just weird shit. But this one felt real and the last time I had this kind of dream, later that day it became real, no joke, thats why i'm posting. In my dream $GME was skyrocketing to Alpha Centauri, the number was exactly $ 1.220 at the end. It started at $880 ( thats when the dream started, and I was checking the price and hyped to see the number). I don't have any share since I live in a 3rd world country and i'm broke as fuck,  but I fully support the apes out there holding, srsly I admire everyone here holding and never giving up.
