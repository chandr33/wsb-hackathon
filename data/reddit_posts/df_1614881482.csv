6,lxr7cc,"Dave Portnoy launched a new ETF today. The stated goal of the ETF is to track the internet and internet fueled stock picks. He hopes to capitalize on the internet’s insights early, so that when (not if) a future GME happens, the ETF will get in early. However, the ETF has been falling since it launched at 9:30. As of this posting it’s down nearly 4% since IPO. Additionally, the ETF’s three largest holdings are twitter, Draft Kings, and Ford. I’m not particularly interested in any of those companies, but i do find the prospect of getting in on the next GME early appetizing. So, what does Wall Street Bets think? DeepFuckingValve whatcha gotta say? Let me hear the people speak and if i like what y’all say, fuck it i’ll put $1000 in YOLO!!!

56,lxrgk7,"I’ve seen many pointing to the lyrics of the song as the kids ride a boat down the chocolate river and into a tunnel. I actually think this is more on-the-nose than that.

The story of Charlie Bucket is one where he &amp; a few other children find Golden Tickets. First off, I think we all know what the golden ticket represents. Upon arriving at the factory, the children are given an everlasting gobstopper and told to not sell or give it away. Through the journey, there are many crazy, stressful things that occur to the voyagers, many ups-and-downs that must be persevered. The man attempting to steal Mr. Wonka’s gobstopper recipe is able to convince and/or con the children out of theirs .... except for Charlie Bucket. In the end, he returns the gobstopper to Mr. Wonka, and is thus rewarded with everything he had dreamt of. In the end, he literally breaks through the glass ceiling and rises above all the other children who just couldn’t .... hold.
