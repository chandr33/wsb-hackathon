Things to look out for ahead are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future

Posted last thursday (&lt;1bil market cap at time)...
Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug **Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

What is it?

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered¬Æ anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID ‚Äì patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation &lt;94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

How does it work?

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don‚Äôt matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here‚Äôs a recent bombshell article from Science Immunology that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What‚Äôs also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn‚Äôt target the virus ‚Äì it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\#variantagnostic)

From the article: ‚ÄúGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds‚Äù

Here‚Äôs another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: Journal of Leukocyte Biology

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‚ÄêCSF might be a key feature of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2‚Äêinduced cytokine storm in COVID‚Äê19 patients""

Does it work?

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I‚Äôve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic --&gt; Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (P=.006)

An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT (NCT04351152) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. Source.

Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success

Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from [Mayo Clinic]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù

ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

Competition

- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

COVID ‚Äì getting worse

As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant, CNN re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and global news re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains as this nature article shows, we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine, which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, &lt;6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, &lt;8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. Here‚Äôs an article from nature, which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. [Source]

TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted

The Market

Here‚Äôs a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: Humanigen. The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

Stockpiling ‚Äì US and ex-US

US market

Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe

Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the Mar 16 fireside chat webcast)

Price forecasting:

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn‚Äôt include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN‚Äôs market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

BONUS -&gt; HIGH SHORT INTEREST

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26-&gt;Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock‚Äôs low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -&gt; more fuel for the rocket ships

BONUS BONUS ‚Äì CAR-T implications and more

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don‚Äôt want to downplay this, I think it‚Äôs very promising and I‚Äôm very bullish on it, but I‚Äôm admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There‚Äôs 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

21,mg27oo,"Welcome to another in my legal series DD, where the long whales could be setting up the shorts for a major fall, and the shorties' tears don't matter.

How are we apes? 

**I'm going to have to preface all my DDs from now on that this is not suggestive of a strategy, nor am I providing any financial nor legal advice.**

**Where I provide speculation, this is my opinion and it is open to interpretation, both positive and negative, and where I'm wrong please let me know, and I'll happily amend.**

**Double, triple and quadruple check everything you read and be excellent to each other when correcting one other, including me as DD is often drawn from a good place to help people. It's never a good look to sit on a high horse with a better than thou attitude**

Let me also preface this by saying a mass recall is rare and tied to events such as important vote meetings or a company buy out, *but they tend to appear when the timing helps the longs*.

With that out of the way, I wanted to dive into what a share recall is and means, and what / who could trigger a recall, as I think many apes want to know.

Were a significant recall to happen to GME, I think it could spell doom for the shorts borrowing a ridiculous amount of stock from just about every corner of the market they can possibly get their greedy hands on.

**Onto the DD, wut is recal?**

Boiled down a share recall is the practice of a lender saying to a borrower who sold their stock short, you must provide me my lent shares back **now by buying it**, and find someone else to borrow from if you want to short.

This materially impacts those with a short position as in order to short a party must first 'locate' a lender willing to borrow their share (although not always, see my FTD DD); as their practice is to sell that share at market price to return it later, hoping they can turn a profit by buying it back at a cheaper price, or even not having to return it at all if the company shorted goes bankrupt.

Although a shorter pays a borrow fee to do this, they can generally hold onto this position for as long as they like, provided they have sufficient capital, which the majority of hedge funds and market players taking short positions are strapped with, unless they're stupidly leveraged of course and the price goes the wrong way **or, the lender issues a recall or both**.

**So that's short selling, and we know a recall forces a buy back, why is this important?**

Well if the other DD is true (and I'm minded to agree) and the stock is shorted **over the available float via rehypothecation (ü¶ç speak, lending out already lent shares) and FTDs**, should *all*, or at least a significant majority of lenders recall their shares, then that's a **big old problem for GME shorts**.

**But first, let's look at typical stock lending agreements**

A (typical) lending agreement generally favours a long, they collect a borrow fee and not just that, **they reserve the right to cancel the agreement at will and without penalty, forcing a short out from their position**.

Therefore **it doesn't matter whether a short has a signal the stock will drop, on recall they are FORCED to cover**, they say shorting is risky no?

In fact, this also presents a benefit to more *informed* longs in that, if they too receive the same information of a stock drop, they can recall and sell their position before the market adjusts to this information, robbing a short of profit.

*Rant - the problem is retail lacks the same kind of research and information, and hears about this kind of thing way later than when institutions and mutual funds have already made their moves, as they can access non public information*

*This is just one of the many reasons many advise others to hold cash accounts, as at least your position isn't being traded ahead of you on your borrowed stock, with superior information, on shares you didn't know were borrowed out - end rant*

An interesting point to note, at least for me, is that when a short position is voluntarily closed, it returns the borrowed share to the lending pool immediately for the next party who wishes to short.

In contrast, a forced liquidation of a short by recall **drains the liquidity of shares available to borrow, as those shares no longer get added to the borrow pool, this is important later**

Now this may seem all doom and gloom but wait wait, hold up, rewind, a lender can recall at any time? **Yup**

My point is, if an institution can see the stock going down in advance of retail, they'll have a good guess of when it'll go *up* too.

Tie this in with an event, say I don't know a general shareholder's meeting which you **know, from non public information** is about to drop a bombshell? You got yourself a golden egg. The important part is the *timing*.

Imagine you're a long institution with a heavily long position in GME. You saw what the others didn't and held onto it and lent your shares out, happily collecting your fee for doing so.

Others join in the shorts as GME is surely a brick and mortar destined to fail following the pandemic. You collect your fee.

You keep collecting fees for your lent shares, and GME's stock reaches a never before seen ~$500 share price and tanks, but you see it going higher. *More* short positions enter.

You **keep collecting fees on your lent shares** and GME has an average shareholder earnings call, and **more shorts enter positions**

Then? The Annual Shareholder Meeting (""AGM"") is announced. You and the long whales üê≥ around you look at each other and realise this stock is shorted **beyond belief**.

What do each of you do? **Recall**

And if everyone recalls? The **shorts are forced to cover and guess what? That pool shorts would ordinarily try and borrow from is essentially empty, and now they can't short it in the same way they did before**

This is a potentially huge catalyst, as each and every short buys back simultaneously and the pool to short again becomes a puddle.

Therefore the longs may have happily sat by, collecting their borrow fee until eventually, they can force this thing to moon.

When can they do this? It depends on when the AGM is announced, but last year shares were recalled on April 10, which falls on a Saturday this year so could be announced on April 9 or 12. Reuters has the date fixed as 11 June 2021, so this could be announced on April 12.

Whilst obviously setting dates on things isn't what this sub does, it's worth bearing (see what I did there?) In mind the price action on or around this date, or 60 days prior to the AGM being finalised, as if a significant majority of lenders force a recall, big things could happen on the stock, as long and the retail whale alike could see GME soar.",Share Recall - The Long Whale Bears Beware DD,1.0,1617059566,Leaglese

[Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--&gt; Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success
4. Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID ‚Äì getting worse**

As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, &lt;6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, &lt;8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here‚Äôs an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -&gt; [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx).

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here‚Äôs a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling ‚Äì US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn‚Äôt include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN‚Äôs market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -&gt; HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26-&gt;Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock‚Äôs low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -&gt; more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS ‚Äì CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don‚Äôt want to downplay this, I think it‚Äôs very promising and I‚Äôm very bullish on it, but I‚Äôm admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There‚Äôs 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

I've been wondering for the past couple weeks what the bull case for the nasdaq 100 is. Let's see if you smooth brains can handle this next level vaccine boosted (both doses) thought process. 

**Booming economy leading to inflation**

This should be obvious. Pandemic goes away, everyone goes out and spends lots of money, prices increase to meet demand, inflation ensues. Some are arguing this will only be temporary, like Papa Powell. Papa is so against real inflation he's said he's gonna let inflation run hot for a while, maybe as high as 2.4% this year.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio)

But you know what? Powell doesn't control interest rates (kinda but not really). And if the bond market starts to feel like yields are not getting enough bang for their buck, Uncle Sam will have a hard time finding buyers at the next treasury auction. If interest rates rise and depending on how quickly, the Nasdaq will have a real pullback since all these unicorns won't have access to cheap money anymore.

**Pandemic 2.0**

Just when you thought it was safe to kiss grandma, new variants are making covid cool again. Brazil is seeing an uptick in deaths among younger patients as a result of new variants. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift)

Parts of Europe are going into lockdowns again because of poor vaccine rollouts, pussies. Lets imagine covid doesn't go away as planned and continues to cause problems. This would lead to another general stock market pullback. Maybe not as big as last year, who knows? But all indexes are priced far above pre pandemic levels.

**So what's the bull case?**

I'm asking you, what's the bull case? Perhaps I'll be able to figure it out after my third covid vaccine

**TL;DR**

66,mg2vk5," 

TLDR: keep at least 1 share. keep 2 or 3 if you have alot of them

Already so everybody knows it's about buy and hold. and everybody want's to be rich and burn the shorts. You always have to think ""what next?""

Info:

1)EVERYBODY wants money, even the shorts, and they will play all the tricks they got. Illegal and Legal. No news we all have seen it.

2) This is a War. Shorts vs Longs (everyone should read ""The art of War - by Sun Tzu. Best book for everything in your life)

3) What is our fuel? - 200% to 2000% short rate - EVERY SHARE HOLDED MATTERS

4) Their strenghts? - knowlege; softwares; teams; capital; tricks and manipulation; power;

5) their weakness? - Dept; greed; leverage; regulations; alot of different tickers to cover; It's their home and they need it to live; And now, Chaos

6) Our strenghts? - Time; no extra costs; upper hand; 1 goal (squeeeezeeee); the actual shares; Free knowlege; big whales

7) our weakness? - paperhands that trade and get scared (me in the past - regret) ; sometime chaos; no knowlege sinse it's their market; no vision (alot of people will sale before 1k)

Alright, sorry for this info, but what is my point? I have 3 points:

1. They can keep draggins this for months- years, IF people trade. They can buy 1M shares a day... 10M shares a day, if people sold. they own 2000% shares? alright... 10M a day, 100 days = 1B shares

1 FUCKING BILION SHARES with 10M shares a day (average day is 15M shares traded). That is why it's SO FUCKING IMPORTANT not to trade, because they can pay back little by little (like you asking for a House Loan to the bank, and then paying month after month for 50 years)

Not only that, but if they keep dragging it, they make money along the way (same way. you work, you get paid, you pay or bills. next month same thing)

2) So yhea, everybody HOLD, they get fucked, their invester cutted (happening right now with banks)... And they get called, and cover their shorts... IT'S DONE RIGHT? FUCK NOOO!!! - IT'S NOT DONE!!

In order for them to buy, people have to sell... they could buy the 2000% shares for 1$ each if people sold at that price. WE ARE THE PEOPLE - WE MAKE THE PRICE

People will get scared! ""from 5k to 1k? oh shiiit!!!i better sell before it gets even lower! 1k is enough for me!""

People that never saw money, will get crazy with 500k in a day, will sell!! (500k is alot right? well if you have 100 shares, it's only 5k/share... not much)

You see... in the End game, it's a team game ""The enemy of my enemy, it's my friend"". Sure, there will be chaos, there will be sellfishness... It's all normal, we are all humans... that's why we need to be selfish but smart!! If we think alone, we will sell first then the rest... there is no rush in selling. I will tell them when they can suck my dick, no rush... and I'll thell by how much

I want to sell at 1M a share? I'll put a sell order at 5M! Do you really think they gonna let you sell the price you want? it will reach 999K and fall to 1k. And you will sell, why? - Because it was so close... you can lose 100k... better than nothing right? sure... but you just lost! and everyone that wanted to sell at 1M or higher. It's all mental, and we are common/basic. We all have the same price target, it's easy to predict

3) Final point, sorry guys. KEEP ONE SHARE. They need to buy those 55M shares. There is not enough illegal, corrupt shit they can to, to erase 55M shares. They can ""delete"" the extra shares that don't exist, they can do whatever the fuck they want. But those 55M shares (not even one less, because they can trade that 1 floating share, 100000000000x times, and get free) Will need to be covered.

End game, everybody is selfish and wants their milion... That 1 share that you don't sell, will get you EVERYTHING and its the only way to make sure everybody sells fucking high. And it's our job, to make sure each one of us makes our part part. Do it for yourself!

""But I can sell that share for an extra 5M"" - Fuck it, set you target price 5M Higher on the other share

Let's burn the roof, the floor, the walls! We want blood and money $$$$

Ps. Our taxes will pay for all the inocente people that will get burn in the process

I can lose whatever I have invested, it's all profits from the past. I'm not leaving without enough money to build schools, build shelters, build a better society, and invest in green energys. 1M is not allot, we just think it is because we are poor!

96,mg3gn5,"There is obviously some fuzzy, or straight out shady, math going on.  We know shares have been shorted, but it's apparently a giant secret just how many.  From what I've learned (and please correct any of this as I go) the hedgies don't need to disclose just how much they've shorted for 30 days.  It also seems they can play fast and loose with that rule.

Next, I've heard about volume glitches.  There's another post about trillion share volume and the chart just skips over some time so the numbers don't add up.

Basically what I'm wondering... With the kind of money that's being discussed (thousands, if not millions, per share) and the inside members only shit that goes on with the hedge funds, mutual funds, etc, it seems like the system is rigged to defend itself.  

Are these fuckheads just sitting there laughing at us, having already ""covered"" all their moves and we just don't know?

I'm not shitposting or anything, I really don't understand much of this other than that I know those bastards will circle the wagons to protect themselves and fuck us.
