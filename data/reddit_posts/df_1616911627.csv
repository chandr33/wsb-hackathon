It looks like hedge funds that didn’t prepare for the recall on us treasury bonds from their margin allowance are in a pretty bad way. To the point that large block trades are occurring in order to preemptively push back on the inevitable blow. HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING, would it be wise to load up on these heavily discounted stocks such as discovery and viacom? Personally I was looking at some of the heavier trading frequencies occurring on the dark pools (or at least checking out someone’s DD that supported this) and saw that some stocks are HEAVILY SHORTED. Do you guys think it would be wise to load up on some stocks before the entire market begins rippling or is it better to just wait until the dust settles and invest from the ground up?

Posiblemente vuelvan a subir con este nuevo parche, el 1.2, una subida de aproximadamente un 30%, no es nada comparado con el caso Gamestop, pero al menos es dinero ganado a la segura

1. Covering shorts when margin called
 
   If we all agree that hedge funds are going to get called on GameStop then the easiest play should be to short the hedge funds largest holdings right?

2. Melvins #1 holding is EXPE

  EXPE looks so god damn inflated right now WAY overbought. I dont actually have any analysis because Im just looking at trends in price. (Not financial advice/not even real DD) BUT hear me the fuck out

EXPE is up almost 200% on the yearly chart AND Melvin owns almost 12M shares according to this 
Whale wisdom site

(Please find me better sources if you can)

3. EXPE only trades at a volume of 3-4M shares a day

   Imagine 12 million shares being dumped on that? This is a get rich quick scheme. If melvin has to liquidate were looking at a 50% drop minimum and I feel like thats generous. 

4. Maybe I can ride both rockets?

   If Melvin has to liquidate before it can buy shares than maybe I can time it well enough to sell my EXPE puts and buy GME calls before the launch. TWO moons in a matter of less than an hour? 

5. Someone prove me wrong, please!

  How can this go bad? Theres gotta be holes in my logic cause I am just a dumb ape. But I want people to think about this and tell me how ignorant I am.

As retail investors, what strategies exist besides buying and hodling?

For instance, what would happen if all retail investors coincidentally purchased one share within a relatively small time window, rather than being distributed throughout one trading day?  Would there be any after effect or consequences to the stock?
