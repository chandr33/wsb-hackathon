Citadel’s Griffin warns of inflation risk to markets enjoying retail trading boom

Stimulus could jolt inflationary pressures back to life, top hedge fund manager warns

March 28, 2021 2:55 pm by Robin Wigglesworth
Financial Times

The retail stock trading frenzy will reach a new crescendo in the coming weeks thanks to the US government’s stimulus cheques but the inflation this support could ignite represents a threat to the stock market bull run, according to Citadel’s Ken Griffin.

The founder of one of the world’s biggest hedge funds thinks the $1,400 sent out to millions of Americans this month is likely to fuel another spasm of retail trading before activity settles down to a still-elevated level. Amateur trading would remain a powerful feature in US equities, he said.

[...]

On the whole, Griffin says he is optimistic on the outlook, and hailed the retail trading boom as a way for more Americans to benefit from the US stock market. But he warned of a doomsday scenario in which accelerating inflation deepens a bond market sell-off, sends stocks tumbling and stokes unrest among retail investors hurt in the process. 

[...]

Griffin highlighted how an oblique tweet of a McDonald’s ice cream cone and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock’s price in one afternoon in February.

“The fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years,” Griffin said. “It represents a dynamic where certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds. You’ve taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.”

37,mfgrad,"Nomura, a giant Japanese bank that has a US brokerage arm just lost $2 billion on margin loans to a single client that when bust.  Rumor is reportedlly Archegos.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura\_Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings)

The losses were probably triggered in  (viac disca tencent baba ... etc).  Their margin desk went crawling to goldman to market the stonks in the Archegos portfolio.  Now if Nomora wasn't Archegos' bookie, well that means we have not only one, but two whales that have just beached.

 *Japanese investment bank Nomura announced on Monday it's facing a $2 billion loss on a US client.*  They imply they have more positions to unload.  I sure hope Achegos was short the RKT i got me some fd calls when i saw it poping eod.

The Fallout:

Either way, the sudden plunges no doubt put other hedge funds on teh ropes.  And with the loss of $2 bil plus by nomora they now have to to pair back their margin lending on other clients.

Also, if Nomorua took a hit on this, it means Achegos, a 20 bil hedge fund lost their whole capital base.  Melvin took a 6 bil hit.  The rich are going to flee these hedge funds. 

All of this points to epic hedge fund liquidations.   Hedge funds have long and short positions, so that means that as they unwind they will be selling some stocks and buying to cover others.

The Trades:

Results: some stonks will tank hard, others will moon.   Trade carefully, and where possible 'go for the juggular.'   I got a feeling FD calls in the direction of momentum in any time is the right move.  Don't try to buy pullbacks or short rallys.  I think beting with the momenum in any stonk will be the best next week, not against.  Dont try to 'defend' and positions.  Go with the flow.

Folks if you find something you think is being puked on margin calls, or squeezed hard on buy ins plz post it with YOLO flair.

I'm long some rkt shares and calls fds i picked up just b4 the close.  its has one of the highest reported short interests based on float (40%).  About 40 mil shares short on 100 il float.  Not on lockup anymore, but there have been NO insider sales even in the last run up.

 I also saw UPST kicking up 15%.  That one is a recent ipo with only 9 mil shares float (rest are on lockup for 4 more months) and a 3.3 mil short position!   YIKES!

I am guessing that as margin calls and deleveraging notices go out to the hedgies its going to be a run for the exits from the 'hedge fund hotels'   The hedge fund hotels are the names these guys are all in.  They have their idea dinners and wind up all doing what the other guy is doing.  So here it goes, first hedgie to the exit lives, the rest go down with margin calls.  Their rich investors will be asking for widthdrawals.  Its over folks, many hedge funds are about to die!

39,mfgs0c,"I’m no expert and this is not financial advice. Pure speculation from this dumb ape.

David Faber from CNBC is reporting that Archegos owned all that Viacom (more were put on sale tonight) through equity swaps, which are not reported because they aren’t done through an exchange. that’s why no one knew who the whales were that went long Viacom causing the stock to go up.

They needed to liquidate for a margin call, but why sell Viacom when it was actually still near the highs? I think the answer is because they could. There were buyers available, even though it was heavily discounted.

Now what if, again pure speculation here, their margin call was forced because of their losing SHORT positions somewhere else? Bill Hwang is a known shorter. In fact, the last time his fund blew up it was for illegal short trades.

So why sell Viacom near the top? It may be, again, because you can. Imagine if Archegos was short AMC and GME. Goldman had to sell Viacom, because closing out GME and AMC is impossible because there are not enough shares. Food for thought.

From Hedge Week regarding shorting via Swaps:

Sometimes, trading through equity swaps is referred to as `synthetic prime brokerage' - with the swap contract deployed as a substitute for borrowing stock to achieve a short position, or equity finance to achieve leverage on the long side.Sep 8, 2005 2005/09/08

This is exact what Apes have been talking about. Synthetic short shares that aren’t counted and its why there is more than 100% short in GME and I speculate AMC as well.

If any of this is true there will be a second act to this play. What happened to VIAC but in the opposite direction.

Even if this isn’t true I feel very confident that this is proof that undisclosed swaps are huge in the market right now. Exactly what the dumb apes have been saying all along.

Again, not financial advice, do your own due diligence.

41,mfgtm4,"Robinhood’s YT Channel

I just discovered Robinhood has a YouTube channel. I haven’t watched through much of their videos, but saw a couple interesting things. 

First, comments are disabled on all their videos (at least all the ones I clicked into). Including their customer Q&amp;A where you would think they would want customers to interact. It’s also good to see Vlad thanking people other than congressmen for their questions.

Second, in the majority of videos I clicked into, there are way more dislikes than likes. Vlad did a recent “fireside chat” with 5 times as many dislikes as likes.  Also found this to be consistent in their other videos where it showed the likes and dislikes (some were hidden).

I just enjoy seeing Robinhood and especially Vlad pretending to care about the customer hosting fireside chats and Q&amp;As while not even allowing customers to interact by disabling comments and getting way more dislikes that likes. No one trusts them and no matter what they do to appear like they care for their customers, the general consensus remains negative.


TL;DR: Robinhood’s YT pretends to care about customers and promote openness, but blocks commenting and receives dislikes from those who see it.

I have no idea what on Allah’s sweet turf I’m talking about on literally any of this, but over a coffee and adderall fueled 48 hours of watching the first few minutes of youtube videos about the concepts here’s my first ever DD (in this case Dunning-Kruger Diligence) 

Thesis: $YETI 7 MAY $67 Calls from present till 28 April

$YETI bottomed out its Implied Volatility cycle and is running sideways on a rollercoaster. Bearish? Fuck em. Bullish? Fuck em. ‘Rooish? Fuck yeah. As implied volatility increases up to the peak of the cycle it will drive up the Extrinsic Value of the Calls. Meanwhile the Intrinsic Value of the calls will increase during the upswings of the rollercoaster. 

There is an opportunity to maximize profit by converging these two forces, selling on the upswing of intrinsic and extrinsic value which should occur roughly around 28 April.

Price target on 7 May (Strike): $70 but it doesnt matter

How did I arrive at this number? I drew lines on a chart with my fingers and guesstimated. So its fake and means nothing. It’s also the average price of the rollercoaster IMO, I think the coaster is shrinking but should at least average to $69.

*Price target on 28 April (profitmaxx day): $67.27-73.86*

Am I allowed to offer a range as a price target? I don’t fuckin know man I’m making all this shit up as I go. 

The $67.27 is where I believe the implied volatility cycle peaks and intersects with the bottoming out of the rollercoaster, which is the worst case outcome, low intrinsic as extrinsic maxes, but you take a profit mostly of the extrinsic and a very small gain in intrinsic. 

The $73.86 is the peak of the coaster around the implied volatility and peak. intrinsic to the tits. extrinsic pretty damn high.

Why do I think it plays out this way? The Greeks, The Underlying, and my secret sauce -

Greeks: 
Delta 0.7 
Theta (0.0544) 
Vega 0.0841 - I fully believe the implied volatility will increase from about .53 to .8 driving the extrinsic up by about $2 over the next 30 days, hedging the $1.63 theta decay. 

Breakeven on implied volatility gains against the theta decay is an increase of implied volatility by .19 to .72. Also, I’m anticipating exiting the position early negating the last bit of Theta Decay. Basically, sell on the upswing closest to 28 APR. 

The Underlying: 

Earnings: projected earnings to occur 6 May, meaning I expect the implied volatility cycle to increase to peak or near-peak by 28 April, just a bit before earnings

Earnings outlook: $YETI is strapped with cash and just expanded further in the consumer space to bags. Anecdotally I feel its the case that YETI has an unusually high attach rate for the space its in. Think of the fucker you know with a YETI mug. 50/50 they own a cooler too and 90/10 they own or would love to own a second one. (DISCLOSURE: i own 3 yeti mugs myself deadass i liked the first one a lot i said why not drop $28.43 on a brand reputation and $3.43 on metal and labor to carry hot coffee around that i cant even fuckin drink because im wearing a mask outside the house). I think people will think YETI is reporting favorable earnings, driving the price up on its way to earnings.

Secret Sauce:
because im fucking stupid and don’t know anything about options trading lmao 

I don’t even have enough fuckin capital in my portfolio to buy the ITM options anyway but I would if I had $900 free. Oh yeah, don’t forget, this is literally my first DD, I have no idea what the fuck I’m talking about, and I can’t even fuckin afford the position.
