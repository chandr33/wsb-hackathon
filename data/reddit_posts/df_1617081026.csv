Their latest test results for their new treatment were not great. But their other host of products were not too adversely affected. 

[test results](https://investors.graybug.vision/news-releases/news-release-details/graybug-vision-reports-preliminary-topline-results-phase-2b)

I currently believe this is being pulled down by the tutes as they’re milking retail dry. Short percentage has gone through the roof for the past week. There is no rational reason why this company should be getting killed for trying to improve eyesight. 

Check it: [shorting ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gray/short-interest)

I believe this company will make it back to greatness. They got a good product and I believe in their leadership. Their CEO, Fred Guerard was voted top 25 CEOs in biotech in 2021. No more FUD for Fred!!

62,mg9wvi,"Hi everyone - I don't post often and mostly at all but lately as I've been looking for value plays, felt the need to plug into the hive mind and see what people smarter then myself might be thinking.

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point). Motivated by this thinking i took up finviz with a basic filter of India based companies, sorted by market cap, and then further looked into how the charts, analyst recommendations and social media sentiment looks. 

I landed on these three tickers, sorted into a convenient screener for whoever is interested in discussing on this post: 

[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=geo\_india&amp;t=HDB,IBN,RDY](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=geo_india&amp;t=HDB,IBN,RDY)

I'll probably do a bit of basic fundamental analysis later but I thought there might be people here who are way ahead of me.

* EVIO Labs specializes in marijuana testing
* Good early growth, new labs, acquisitions
* 2020 impact from Covid-19 and lawsuit led to cost reduction and paying debt off
* Sold some assets including share dilution, CEO resigned
* Pivoting start to the year in 2021, organizational turnaround
* Jan/Feb - New CEO appointed, including other new members of SLT
* March - Lab Upgrade, new contract with $CBDL, fillings in audit, waiting for catalysts

**Post and Research Updates**

FYI – this post has been updated based on further research, errors, CEO update and suggestions from the community. Some of those include edits to changes in Price Target, Senior Leadership Team, Sociability Factors, Upcoming Catalyst, concerns regarding EVIO Labs in 2020.

**Introduction**

Dear Redditors! Here I present you with an in-depth DD on $EVIO. I have spent a lot of hours researching and reading through the history, current state, and the potential future for this ticker. This is a speculative play that is high reward and high risk, however I personally sit more on the bullish side based on some of the things I have uncovered during my research that are presented here below and recent milestones like securing a contract with $CBDL a week ago, new SLT (all women led), lab upgrade in Steep Hill.

Should that be the case, we could expect this ticker reach its previous share price highs in the future that were ranging from **$0.017 – 0.020 cents in August 2020 and beyond depending on business growth. This PT has been tested on two occasions already, on 15 Jan 2021 and 9 Feb 2021. Based on current share price this could equate to 5 x multiplier.**

Please note this is only my opinion and please if I missed anything out do let me know in the comments and I will re-update just like this version.

* Market Cap – 4,632,831
* Share Price – 0.0029
* Float - 89,142,473 – September 3rd, 2020 (waiting for an update – share price represents dilution already taken into effect however Float is not represented yet)

**Upcoming Catalyst**

**EVIO Labs**

Was founded back in 2014, with an aim to become the leading provider of cannabis, hemp, and CBD testing, providing highest quality analytical, R&amp;D and consulting services.

Evio Labs offers all types of cannabis and CBD testing for flower, trim, manufactured products, biomass, crude oils, isolates, distillates, edible, and difficult to test items like patches and aerosols. Their capabilities include up to 13 cannabinoids, 42 terpenes, 66 pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbial tests, plant leaf ratios, plant inspections, and more.

**Operating EVIO Lab locations**

* Alberta Canada (Keystone Labs)
* Berkeley, California (Steep Hill)

**History**

Evio Labs had a lot of success in the early days, being most respected and reputable organization within the CBD testing. They excelled and stood out from their competition by building a world class team to ensure they provide high levels of testing accuracy, exceptional customer service and professionalism.

Year on year end they have demonstrated financial growth with a focus on expanding and acquiring new labs. Most recent reports indicate EVIO Lab **revenue increased 12.3%** increase during the first quarter ending December 31, 2019 and an **18% increase** during second quarter ending March 31, 2020.

**However (concerns)!**

Covid-19 had massive impact on the organization **resulting in 45% reduction** in revenue during the third quarter ending June 30, 2020. They were also being sued by the State of Oregon for allowing employees to take marijuana home instead of destroying the residue (why waste stuff ☹). This forced them to sell of assets and dilute shares to settle the debts. This included the sale of their labs in Massachusetts and Oregon. This is where, we can see the dip in share value, alerting investors to re-strategize for the right reasons.

Furthermore, the CEO, co-founder William Waldrop has decided to resign and stepdown in December 2020 (3 months ago). Due to change in leadership and organizational re-structuring they have failed to report to SEC and received a STOP sign, in my view probably because they were themselves in the midst of major re-structuring.

**Bullish Future State and Market Needs**

Despite, the concerns mentioned in the above, to me, this ticker presents an exciting opportunity to be a part of a turnaround story for this organization. In my view, this where investors can make huge returns by identifying and speculating future organizational states before they come to fruition and, this could be one of those tickers.

For one, the most obvious fact, that weed is getting legalized suggesting favourable market growth. Weed stocks are hot, and they will remain hot for the next couple of years. I am sure, most of you guys noticed how some of those have already blown up and are not planning to stop. More weed = more testing.

**But enough of that**, Lori Glauser, is the new CEO of EVIO labs since recent William’s departure. She is also the co-founder of EVIO, and her track record from previous organizational experience suggest she has more than enough capability to run and take this business forward. She worked at IBM, and most recently at EY (the BIG 4) and consulted various utility executives of multinational organizations. Since being appointed, she started picking up the pieces and is preparing the organization for growth in 2021 and beyond. She has built a completely new SLT (women led), that are currently settling in their roles. Here below are milestones she achieved so far suggesting so.

**Evidenced Milestones**

* New website, 2020 - [https://hemptesting.com/](https://hemptesting.com/)
* Management transition, January / February 2021
* Lab Facility Upgrades, March 2021 (you can see the pictures on her FB profile and IG)
* Getting verified on OTC, March 2021 (OTC official website)
* New contract with $CBDL, March 2021
* These step-by-step milestone achievements suggest to me they are looking to turnaround in 2021 which was also raised by EVIO SLT previously suggesting they anticipate full recovery in this fiscal year.

**Sociability Factor**

These guys have quite a large following across social media platforms, however, have been quite inactive, which of course is expected as of my previously raised concerns. Although, this is expected to change over the next couple of months when Lori finally gets the core business objectives achieved like SEC filings and removing the STOP sign.

This is already becoming evident based on their recent Facebook (FB) and Instagram (IG) post updating followers on their lab developments, changes to SLT and responding to investor questions. You can also view their upgraded lab facilities via FB and IG.

Please also note there is a website called ***“OTCBBSTOCKNEWS”*** that is spreading false news, so please ignore news updates from them.

**Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**

As mentioned in the above EVIO Labs had a complete sweep through their previous SLT to such extent that it is now all woman led. Management transition has only just taken place around Jan/Feb timeframe. I think this is a good step in direction towards diversity and inclusion and likewise demonstrates an attempt for a turnaround. Photos of SLT can be viewed on FB post as I found that not everyone has LinkedIn profiles.

**Conclusion**

EVIO labs was a successful start-up, growing, expanding, and become the number one in CBD and Hemp testing and consulting services, resulting in increasing revenue year on year. However, Covid-19 has impacted the business greatly, including a lawsuit, forcing the organization to re-structure, sell assets and dilute some shares. Although, the new CEO has started to pick up the pieces to ensure 2021 acts as a pivotal year to resume and maintain the brand image.
