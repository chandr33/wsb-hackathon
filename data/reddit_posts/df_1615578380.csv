12,m3pixv,"I know old WSB doesn't need this - I hear you guys actually knew some stuff about trading - WELL TOO BAD, now you're more retarded than ever and we're starting back at 0.. probably below that actually. 

Anywho0o0, as a new retard watching my calls expire OTM today, I thought I'd give some super basic tips to all the new retards. If you actually have trading experience then you probably don't want to waste your time because I am on the low end of the IQ spectrum and it may do more than just smoothen your brain. 

# Background NOBODY wants: 

I didn't join WSB until 1/28/2021 (yes, I'm one of those people) - I started trading mid summer of 2020 and made okay returns. Didn't do any research whatsoever and just looked at previous highs of big companies and seeing how down they were down from pre-COVID levels - it was pretty much a sure thing to buy in and sell a month or two later (literally easiest time to trade so I got lucky). That's the extent of my experience, until I started obsessing over the market after learning about WSB. Sorry, but am geigh and can't not say it, I love it here and haven't felt so at home in a community.. really ever. 

\*group hug\*  Okay, get the fuck off me

# Gather round retards (autists can skip) 

**Big important tip #1** \- don't fucking sell when the price drops to the VERY bottom. Paper Hands Portnoy - perfect example of horrible execution. That should be obvious but what in the fuck are people doing panic selling AFTER it has already plummeted? Stonks go up remember? If you missed panic selling on the way down then un-shrivel your balls and hold until the next bump upwards (if you think it's going back down).

**Big important tip #2** \- if you like the stonk but you're in the red AND you believe in the investment you've made then LOWER YOUR COST BASIS. Buy that red flavored crayon even if it's not your favorite - I prefer the green because it reminds me of guacamole, but red reminds me of salsa and salsa is good too. It does not make sense to hold significantly in the red without averaging down IF you believe it will go back - it gives you a much lower break-even point (specifically for everyone who bought the memes at their peak, join the club) and gives you the chance for greater tendies if you sack up and hold longer than it takes you to $CUM to your wife's bf's $ASS... [careful now, he might see you in the closet.](https://tenor.com/view/rick-and-morty-superman-closet-hiding-gif-15512319)

**Big important tip #2a (cause basically the same)** \- KEEP SOME LIQUIDITY FOR WHEN YOUR STOCK GOES DOWN. I know FOMO is real and the thought of ""holy shit it's going to the moon"" smoothens all of our brains. The last thing I wanna miss out on is the rocket ride but there's always a tasty dip waiting around the corner, and more importantly the chance to fix your horrible entry price. You can't taste that dip if you have no tendies TO dip. I know it's hard not to throw all your tendies at the rocket ship but you're probably retarded, just like me, and don't realize what in the holy hell is actually happening even AFTER reading that *really good* DD. So keep some cash in your account until you've got more dip than your tendies can handle or you can dIveRsiFy, I hear that's a really fun and cool way to invest these days. 

**Big important tip #3** \- DONT TOUCH OPTIONS UNTIL YOU REALLY GET THEM or are totally happy with losing your premium on buys. Definitely don't touch the sell side of options - holy shit, how do so many of you have margin accounts without understanding your potential loss. Look at the panic posts on r/options 

**Big important tip #3a** \- DONT TRADE WITH MONEY YOU DONT HAVE IF YOU DONT GET WHAT YOURE DOING. I would say never trade with money you don't have but some people are way smarter than me and if you could convince me there was a sure thing I'd probably gamble with money I don't have too. If you do gamble with money you don't have...[you're gonna have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/51h8kf).

**Big important tip #4** \- you are here to make tendies, sweet sweet tendies. You will not guess the bottom and you will not guess the peak. If you do, that's amazing and you can let your wife's boyfriend know for a free ice cream but do not ever expect to, otherwise you will be waiting for a previous high that'll never come and you'll be stuck bagholding or you'll be waiting for a new low that just isn't going to hit and you'll miss the rocket that could've recovered those bags. Two horrible scenarios. Pick a reasonable range and make that your entry/exit price. You can always dip out or in 10-20% and continue that method as the price does down or up. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; \*jumbled moaning\* Don't sell low, buy low. If red, and ape still believe, buy red. Sell green, but green exciting and hard to guess so sell some green and wait then sell more green. If ape have no bananas, then ape no trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

WTI oil prices right now are 66$ and have been in the 60s for some time now. Analysts have said 80$ to 100$ oil will likely come in 2021 or 2022. Laredo is expanding with the Howard County purchase and recently announced a 75M ATM offering (which seems to be complete now that the SP has broken out of the 33-36 range.) Personally I think the ATM was to get more oil pumping and to take advantage of these high oil prices. (And soon to be even higher). Wells Fargo assisted with the ATM offering and now has come out and increased their PT to 46$, others have even higher PTs right now. 

Let's not forget: Vaccines are WAY ahead of schedule. Recently was announced that all adults will be able to get their shot by May 1. Think about all the pent up travel demand right now, people are itching to travel, hit the beach or head to the mountains. The admin just signed 1400 stimmy checks to most of the gen pop! I bet so many people are going to be using this money for a nice vacation now that they can travel confidently again. 

If you compare Laredo to their competitors they are WAY undervalued. This is an absolute hidden gem that I am sharing with you because you guys/gals have made me $$$ in the past. Yes, I already have boughten shares, and Yes, I am continually buying more. I truly believe this is worth 75$ right now. If oil prices maintain, or even raise then the stock prices follows.

77,m3pv3j,"Hi everyone,

First time making a DD. I believe SCHN is ripe for an upswing and rally to earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what we know: The covid-relief stimulus package has been passed both in the House and Senate, and it's been signed by Biden. The next step is for Biden to release a statement on the infrastructure bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Running parallel to the upcoming catalysts, steel futures have been going up as you can see here:

[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel\_quotes\_globex.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)

&amp;#x200B;

[Steel HRC Futures](https://preview.redd.it/k2do7gmaknm61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=719f91e3ef547fe5f28ba831520653ac20604f89)

&amp;#x200B;

Adjusted for inflation, we're already nearing towards 2008-lvl of sky-high steel prices.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to present SCHN's own market trends during their Q1 2021 earnings call:

&amp;#x200B;

[Market Trends](https://preview.redd.it/ez5i5afklnm61.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4fa83a237fa892eb5446d7a7b0042471c2fc3e)

As you can see, SCHN had their earnings quarter right before the massive spike across all trends and THEY STILL BEAT EARNINGS BY 50%.

Their Q2 earnings are estimated to be $0.90 EPS, which is 67% higher than their Q1 earnings.

You might be asking, well gee how did analyst come up with that number? They did dumb math and tried to price in any potential market beat by the same amount. 50% and 67% are pretty close all things considered.

**TOO BAD THESE ANALYSTS ARE DUMB. THIS SHIT GOING TO BEAT EARNINGS BY 100% = 1.80 EPS**

**NO ONE CAN STOP THIS COMMODITY SUPERCYCLE AND GUESS WHAT? SCHN IS GOING TO LEAD THE CHARGE.**

**An earnings run-up play? This sounds so easy, what's the downside?**

The downsides are simple: This stock has an average trading volume of 260k

&amp;#x200B;

# Meaning there ain't that much liquidity going around compared to their total float

What's their available float you ask?

&amp;#x200B;

7% is owned by insiders, 86% owned by institutional ownership.

**TL;DR:** It peaked in Jan 07, 2021 at $42.19 and I believe with all the upcoming catalysts it can rally to higher lows and higher highs right before earnings. (Est. beginning of April). PT $70 because shit don't make sense nowadays anyways.

The clause reads:-  ""29.3 If we think, in our reasonable opinion, that an Exceptional Event has occurred or is occurring, we may make the following changes to your eToro account without telling you: (c) close your open transactions at a price that we reasonably think is proportionate; (e) cancel all open orders or trades which are affected by the exceptional event. If you lose money as a result, we will not be liable to you.""  If you read the previous clause 29.1 explains what an 'Exceptional Event' is;  29.1 An ""Exceptional Event"" includes:  (i) excessive changes to the price, supply or demand of any product. We may also call an Exception Event where we anticipate this change (within reason); (m) an event which significantly disrupts the market, which could include (but is not limited to) the premature close of trading in the market of a product, excessive movements in the price, supply or demand of a product, whether regulated or unregulated, that our Services relate to.""  These two clauses explain that an exceptional event is defined. Regardless of you claiming that 'this is not an exceptional event, it is anticipated', they have explained that an exceptional event is; 29.1(m): excessive movements in the price, supply or demand of a product.

Ok, listen up. You might be hearing the term Gamma Squeeze. That’s this: https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/

You’ve noticed GME hasn’t moved much, and that’s because there are a lot of call options that have been sold and will expire useless at EOD if the stock price is below the strike price  

There are A LOT of contracts between 250-300. Institutional money will do everything it can to keep GME below that. 

The thing is, if we can get it above $300 today at close, all these contracts will expire IN THE MONEY...and yes, they will have to buy up 100 shares of GME for every contract. And if they’re covered, they will have to sell ones they are in control of. 

So, it’s time you degenerates. Load up all the extra dry powered to got to push this thing past $300 and keep it there. 

If you currently own call options ITM you could also exercise them to have the same effect. It’s an important move today that will help us with the bigger squeeze squozing.",Trying one more time - Last minute GME DD for today - please don’t delete WSB,1.0,1615579654,meanpeopelsuck19
