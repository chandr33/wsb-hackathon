I'm 23. Through all my life I wasn't allowed to take many decisions for myself, investing is one of those. My finances have always been handled by my guardian ""for my own sake"" until the ""right"" time came. 
January was for me the right time to do an investment but I was held back once again, with something like ""That's a nice way to lose your money"", if only they knew... But I'm tired now.
I ""stole"" 2k from MY bank account (funny right) a couple days ago and managed to open a Degiro account.
