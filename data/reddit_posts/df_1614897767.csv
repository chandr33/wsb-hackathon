30,lxxnws,"This post has a 99% chance of getting deleted so I'm not gonna waste my time posting a huge DD here. If it survives I'll edit it with all the DD you can stand, but otherwise just click on my profile an look for my WFC (Wells Fargo) DD. Here's the TL;DR  


1.) WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  
2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.

3.) WFC is one of the only big banks that hasn't reached it's pre-pandemic highs, meaning it still has room to run.

4.) When Ryan Cohen sold his stake in Chewy he invested it into just two stocks, AAPL and WFC. You could buy AAPL, but that's a tech stock that isn't going to do as well in a high interest rate &amp; high inflation environment as a bank.

5.) Michael Burry initiated a large position (3.3% of his fund) in WFC last quarter. You all know what happened last time Burry and Cohen agreed on stock.

6.) WFC has really freakin' cheap options. June 45c (that's about 22% out of the money) were going for 80 cents today. IF WFC gets to $50 by June (about 34% gain) those calls would be worth $5 intrinsically. That's over 500% gains on the calls, I'm sure you can do the math if it goes higher.

59,lxxrdk,"I'm sure a lot of you technical analysts have already spotted this and have your own opinions but I think this post could help bring some clarity for people who don't read charts. 

Just for the record, I am 19 and haven't been doing this for more than 6 months but it's basic data I'm showing. I'm also pretty retarded. Here we go....

I've noticed that the longer term chart patterns tend to be fractal because, I think, the smaller patterns are confirming the overall psychology of the market and with time, if the sentiment hasn't changed, those can be seen in a greater scale. 

Back in September of this year and lasting until November, a double bottom pattern formed in the index charts. The double bottom is a bullish pattern so most of us made some fucking tendies. If you zoom in the chart a bit on the first leg of the pattern you can see another, smaller double bottom that formed over two weeks. The sentiment in the market didn't change and this back and forth battle between bulls and bears continued but on a larger scale. 

Here's a picture, my monkey friends: 

  

[Isn't she beautiful?](https://preview.redd.it/4942z3t5t2l61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce0cf1c753e6a62bb80a0345f67b98d844b90641)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That was the past. Let me take you back to the present.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For most of us it's been a rough couple weeks to place bullish trades. If you're holding stock, you might be considering selling or maybe buying the dip. It takes time and practice to get really good at reading the market, so I hope some serious traders see this and share their opinion.

What I'm seeing so far is a volatile fight between bulls and bears. We're expecting a correction to happen eventually. We hear it all the time especially from boomer traders who think an Armageddon is coming to the NYSE and that angles are going to come with their weapons of sanity and send the market to Lucifer.

The double top pattern we're seeing on indexes now is bearish obviously and could mean a bigger double top which might take weeks or a couple months to complete. If that's the case, then there is big downward potential in the market (Which could mean even bigger upward potential after, depending on whether MM's are high on speed or Quaaludes). 

The double top has the same textbook rules as the double bottom, except the double top is bearish and it looks like an M instead of a W. 

Here's a chart of the SPX where that pattern can be seen:

  

[A sorrowful red market](https://preview.redd.it/6tsyjy0i23l61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e731047c91082bc497cfe0a89cdf08543505b6e)

&amp;#x200B;

Since many traders have been waiting impatiently, and not very successfully, since about the first upward move after COVID for this moment of glory when they could short the market near the top, make some moolah, and say ""I told you so""; there is definitely enough bearish sentiment to make the bigger double top pattern. Or maybe a dead cat bounce. I'm going to attach my hypothesis in the form of a chart here and you all share your thoughts.    

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nyg7qfnnc3l61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5046548a17b66cb9e256d7f79f5d45ae9c0b36

&amp;#x200B;

There has been huge upticks in red volume across the board. That's institutional volume. Smart money. Our trades need to be on the same side as the smart money when it comes to big cap stocks and the stocks that index's track, so we really do need to ignore retail sentiment here and try to figure out if institutions are taking profit and than buying the dip, or if enough of them are bearish that they kill momentum for a little while. The Feb 1 bull day didn't have high volume in several big cap stocks, cloudflare, walmart, etc and then there was the big slide after suggesting smart money wasn't interested in buying. Maybe different circumstances happed between that time. I've heard that some hedge funds had to sell  so they could cover GME shorts but I don't think they have the capital anymore to buy those stocks back. Lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post gets some attention and I didn't just spend two hours thoughtfully caressing my pecker with a feather pen for no reason. The point of me posting this isn't so I can convince you to sell, it's so we can make some money on the downside and prove to Jim Cramer and friends that we're not all a bunch of retards that only know how to hit buy. Shorting can be really damn profitable too.  Am I onto something, or should I shut the fuck up and eat a few oranges? 

I'm not really qualified to be offering my opinion, I just want to start a discussion on what's happening.",The small double top found on index charts from Feb 23 - present could be an indication of a bigger double top to come.,0.87,1614898526,Towelie5
