43,lxpz7q,"I understand that mortgage companies are tied to interest rates, but RKT is the first and leading company in its particular niche.  The EPS was positive,  and even if the rates increase RKT is in a unique position because of the share of the online mortgage market that it holds.  Why does the company have a 40% short interest?  Funds obviously believe that real estate is going to be a tough sector this year, but even if it is, I can’t see RKT being deserving of 40% short interest.  The housing market is a critical market in our economy and regardless of a rise in interest rates, with people still fleeing states like California and New York, I don’t see a dramatic slowdown in the future.

Any differing opinions, that will allow me to make a more informed decision would be greatly appreciated,  the media is telling everyone that Monday was a WSB fueled rally, but I feel that it had to be more than just WSB.

65,lxq24n,"I've been building a position in United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices I decided to offer some DD to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio.

**TLDR: UWMC is better than RKT and I think it's better for both the short-term traders and the long-hold investors.**

I have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over Reddit recently so I won't bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows:

* Went public with a $16B valuation based on ONLY three quarters of 2020 (9.5X multiple on adjusted income)
* In Q3 2020 alone they did $1.45B in net income (which means their Q4 reporting towards the end of April is going to be massive!)
* At today's price the dividend yield is over 4% annually!  Ex-dividend date is this coming Tuesday, meaning if you're going to buy do it BEFORE Tuesday March 9th
* It was announced this week they'll be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 Index beginning March 22nd which means EXTRA buying necessity between now and earnings

**For the semi-retarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP!**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as a realtor I'd like to add some professional analysis here and I'll touch on RKT briefly too because they're being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different.

&amp;#x200B;

1. It doesn't matter what mortgage rates are, mortgage originators always make X% margin on every loan they sell. **What matters is the number of purchases and refi's (ie how many widgets they sell)** Nationwide there is a MASSIVE shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to ""normal"" we'll see 1X, 2X, 5x, and in some markets even 10X the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated.  **Profits are way higher on new purchases vs. refi's so while nobody is turning refi's down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases.**  Anybody who tuned in to UWMC's final sales call of 2020 for their national reps heard their **CEO Matt Ishba talking about how they'd spend the money they'd get from going public and he was all about RELATIONSHIPS**.  Relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence (insurance agents, title companies, etc)
2. **RKT has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan** than what is considered normal (3-4 weeks right now). Originators like the salespeople working through UWMC have a major competitive advantage against Rocket and others because they close deals fast! That is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option.  **RKT may get a lot of market share for refi's (the lower profitability loans) but UWMC is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume**, especially as supply of homes for sale (new and pre-owned) increases to meet demand).

Now, anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now!  Think ""*Melvin Capital scrounging for GME shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever*"" insane!  Mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are FOMO'ing hardcore into paying these escalating prices.  ***That's a great thing for sellers but doesn't do anything good or bad for UWMC holders.***

&amp;#x200B;

**THIS IS WHAT MATTERS FOR UWMC INVESTORS:**

**As inventory increases** (*which it will because in some states Covid made it near impossible to sell*) in 2021 **and as prices become to normalize** (*causing more people to want to move because it won't be insanely expensive on the buy side*) **the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase**.  Again, it doesn't matter if interest rates go up a little, it's not like they're going to double.  Interest rates are at all time lows [as seen here from Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) and that isn't going to change for years to come.

UWMC pays a regular dividend, is about to announce an insane Q4 on or around April 23rd, and since they're the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into 2021.

**Short-Term Traders:** Best bet for you is to buy slightly OTM April or May calls.  Personally I'd buy May calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings run-up (if that happens) and/or holding them through ER if the run-up isn't significant enough due to the market's overall vibe right now.  Buying May calls gives you extra insurance which I like but degens should stick to April and save the premim.

**Long Term Investors:** At current prices (between $9-10/share today) if you're not buying now than there is no helping you.  I've bought at levels as low as $9 and as high as $12 and I'm comfortable anywhere in that range.  I don't think a price of $16-18 by year's end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with.  I believe we'll see over $20/share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to 2019 levels and I'd guesstimate that is 50/50 shot.

**TLDR Again: Tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP in April!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Proof of my 10,000 share position**:  [https://imgur.com/B65AGW9](https://imgur.com/B65AGW9)

&amp;#x200B;

**My Buy Orders Today Are Set:**

* 1,000 shares @ $8.71 (filled)
* 1,000 shares @ $8.61 (filled)
* 1,000 shares @ $8.51
* 1,000 shares @ $8.41
* 1,000 shares @ $8.31

&amp;#x200B;

**Again, this is just the bull thesis.**  I think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that I can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested.  Well....

1. Making money is sexy to me, I don't know about you fruits
2. Most of the members here are young and untested too, probably spreading STI's all over your local areas via Grinder before Covid

**Good luck to all, happy trading, and let's expand our horizons a little like the old days of WSB.**

Edit 2: Adding this [amazing article](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2021/03/04/united-wholesale-mortgage-ultimatum-rocket-companies/4578357001/) where the CEO of UWM, Matt Ishbia, walked into the room for his Facebook Live broadcast to UWM's brokers, unzipped his pants, whipped his thing out, smacked them around a little bit, and zipped back up and dropped the mic.  **TLDR: He told UWM loan officers that effective Mid-March they must decide whether they'll keep working with Rocket OR United Wholesale Mortgage because working with both would no longer be an option (this will hurt RKT, not UWMC).**",United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) - Bull Thesis From a Real Estate Professional,0.78,1614878926,MadeToOrderName

I'm looking for somewhere to blow some steam. I've been navigating how to invest my hard working savings for over two decades, and because of pandemic, as many other people, I saw myself with my savings going down the drain. So, I tried to educate me in how to operate a trading account, and since then I learn how to take my winning and losses gracefully. (mostly losses) Learn how to look charts and try to find the best moment to get into a position I believe is in a good place for swing or long term investment, and not day trade. However, as we all know, market is bearish, and everything goes with it. But looking into the recent events with GameStop, I got myself wondering. Did the big money guys, that have been clearly manipulating the market forever, leaving the average Joe (like myself) to either give them my money (so they can correctly ""manage"" it for me) or they will take it by creating movements that swap your stop loses positions or zero or cash. 

The reason I'm saying that is because just yesterday, some big money guy releases some intel on a company call XL Fleet, saying he is going short on it because he got some insider giving him intel, which leads him to believe the company is not worth the money. Therefore, creating and extreme down movement, which he capitalize on it, because a lot of people just react to information and don't educate themselves before selling or buying, and hurting people that have a honest plan to invest in an apparent good business model. I understand the risks in investing in a fairly new company, but there is no limit to what these guys can put out there? They can say any crap, and then capitalize in people's overreaction? The GameStop saga did not teach anyone anything? 

Really disappointing. Not just losing a substantial amount of money, that eventually will correct, but the unnecessary volatility that these ""professionals"" take profits in people's money. 

Feel free to educate me more.",Not clear if I still trust in an honest market for average Joe to invest.,0.69,1614879070,leobotelho01

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: This theory is also correlative with/supported by the fact GME fought hard to stay green yesterday (March 3rd) when the entire market was bleeding. It will be interesting to see how it responds when we approach the close today since we've spent the early morning under this baseline as part of a complete market selloff.

Let me begin by saying, this could be an absolute coincidence, but my tinfoil hat and Alex Jones voodoo doll suggested otherwise. So, I took Eddie Bravo’s advice, and I “LOOKED INTO IT.” These are my findings.

This is NOT financial advice; nor should it be construed as such. I am a broke law student with a vested interest in the success of GME. I also have an innate ability to decipher logic and rational behavior, so I’ve decided to share my opinion with you all for your own preponderance. Feel free to discuss, as I embrace the importance of evaluating a set of facts from various perspectives.

If you have not done so already, please read, or skim, the OP below, and pay homage to both [u/dan\_bren](https://new.reddit.com/u/dan_bren/) and [u/tapakip](https://new.reddit.com/u/tapakip/) for their service in bringing this information to my attention. Once you’ve done so, return here. If you’ve read their posts already, proceed to the gates of Valhalla below.

[$100MM of DEEP ITM GME CALLS have been purchased since 3/1(Monday) : GME (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx5kgk/100mm_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have_been_purchased/)

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be a dick. Just skim it at least. Or my analysis won't make sense at first.

&amp;#x200B;

As [u/tapakip](https://new.reddit.com/u/tapakip/) points out in the comment below, there is a very strong presumption that these calls were all purchased by the same buyer. They are the only one purchasing calls that are this deep ITM within the last three days, and are all purchased out of the Philadelphia exchange. It's actually mindboggling to me that anyone would be willing to shell out this much premium and take on the exponential amounts of risk. All in all, it makes the most logical sense that these have all been bought by the same individual when considering the facts we have.

Now, as you know (I hope), each call option is the right to purchase 100x of the underlying. In the calculations below, I assume you know can comprehend the following equation:

&gt;Options x Strike = Exercise cost (x100)

Before you say some dumb shit in the comments, \*\*Do not confuse exercise cost with the purchase price of the actual option.\*\* We'll get there. Thanks in advance, dumbass.

**3/1/2021 Purchases**

* 540 x 12 = $648,000
* 540 x 12 = $648,000
* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000
* 600 x 12 = $720,000
* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000
* \*515 x 7 = $360,500
* \*500 x 5 = $250,000

**3/2/2021 Purchases**

* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000
* 600 x 15 = $900,000

**3/3/2021 Purchases**

* 1,300 x 12 = $1,560,000
* 600 x 15 = $900,000
* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000
* 580 x 12 = $696,000
* 580 x 12 = $696,000
* 550 x 12 = $696,000

What do all of these add up to?

I’ll save you idiots the trouble. **It costs an additional $12,298,500 in order for this whale to exercise all of their calls.**

Next, let’s find out what this leviathan actually spent to acquire these options. Yes, asshole, now I am calculating the purchase price. Sorry for your inconvenience.

New equation:

&gt;Options x Price = Cost Basis (x100)

**3/1/2021 Purchases**

* 540 @ 98.45 = 5,316,300
* 540 @ 96.05 = 5,186,700
* 1200 @ 105.85 = 12,702,000
* 600 @ 101.25 = 6,075,000
* 600 @ 99.60 = 5,976,000
* \*515 @ 106.55 = 5,487,325
* \*500 @ 110.90 = 5,545,000

**3/2/2021 Purchases**

* 1200 @ 108.15 = 12,978,000
* 600 @ 104.95 = 6,297,000

**3/3/2021 Purchases**

* 1,300 @ 108.40 = 14,092,000
* 600 @ 105.15 = 6,309,000
* 600 @ 103.15 = 6,189,000
* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700
* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700
* 550 @ 109.00 = 5,995,000

I won’t even ask this time, I know you can’t count that high. **It’s a grand total of $104,582,725.** OP’s estimate of $100MM was very close. To be blunt, that’s a lot of cocaine and hookers.

# 

# This is where things get interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as OP also pointed out, **the buyer has the right to purchase 942,500 shares by April 16** (note: the options above with an \* expire on Jan 20, 2023 and Jan 21, 2022, respectively). Nevertheless, they are all ITM, so the buyer can exercise them whenever they feel enlightened.

Let’s do some more math; apes love math. This behemoth has already shelled out \~$104MM for these options and has the RIGHT, not obligation, to shell out an additional $12,298,500 for the actual shares.

$104,582,725 + $12,298,500 = **$116,881,225 (purchase price + exercise price)**

We also know the total # of shares to be \[potentially\] exercised is 942,500.

Using this information, we’ve (me, mostly) done enough work to extrapolate a rough break-even price for this colossus of clout buyer.

**$116,881,225 / 942,500 = 124.01**

# This big whale’s total breakeven price lands at $124.01/share.

&amp;#x200B;

Shut the hell up. I know you just mumbled to yourself ""that’s underwhelming as fuck."" Just consider yourself a smooth brain. That's why I'm here.

I will admit, that on its face, it might seem like I wasted all of our time. Now hit that joint or Moscow mule and ponder what it actually means……

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome back brother. If you couldn’t think of anything, again confirming how smooth your brain is, let me help.

&amp;#x200B;

A *massive fucking buyer* just exposed themselves to an exorbitant amount of risk; they could LOSE *tens of millions* within minutes. With that in mind, I can guaran-fuckin-tee that nobody on this planet would over-leverage themselves in the amount of \~$116,881,225 without having (A) some extremely important information or (B) some serious fucking diamond kahonas. My wager would be on the former, but also the latter.

**In any case, anyone who drops \~$116M over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets. They have more money, that’s a fucking fact.**

Compound that with this buyer’s breakeven at $124.01. **It logically follows, we have found our new BASELINE PRICE for GME.** Let me explain.

Consider all this information with what happened yesterday. **GME CLOSED AT $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER’s BREAKEVEN.**

What ensued in AH? A back-and-forth teetertotter throughout the entire AH session. Ultimately, every time GME dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.

In sum, I believe the new baseline price is $124.01. Relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning, I am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending his/her breakeven price at $124.01. Do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else. They might, but its in their own best interest to hold that line, whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern. Furthermore, think about it yourself, if you dropped a combined $100M in three consecutive days, you must have a contingency plan. It is my belief that this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options. They'll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play.

I would be remissed if I didn't acknowledge there's a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass Ape like us hitting a ballsdeep YOLO play with his entire Trustfund inheritance. But I doubt it.

In the event my hypothesis checks out, GME is currently sitting at its new support level. This is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity.

# TL;DR.

**I believe the new baseline price for GME is $124.01.** This is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent \~$104M (\~$116M if exercised) on call options spanning the last three days, March 1st-March 3rd.

With that in mind **GME closed yesterday at $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER’s BREAKEVEN.**

To go further, **every time GME dropped below $124 in the AH session, it hit a springboard** back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.

It is my belief that **this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets** than what they leveraged out on the options. They'll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play, **which means keeping the price above their $124.01 breakeven.**
