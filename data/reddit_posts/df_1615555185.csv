Monkey: BANANAS! 🐒

BANK: this is a save bet, as GME is going to the moon soon anyways. If it fails, which is very unlikely, I will take the bananas of your parents and of other monkeys.

I’ve been there in the good and bad you see
It all started a few months ago
When the hedgies did a bit too much blow

GameStock, they said was going to plummet.
It’s dieing retail, it’ll never reach the summit 
But little did they know there was not a cat in town
Who noticed the antics of these hedgie clowns

Buy the dip he said from $4 to $2
It was dismal it seemed, the buying was through
But then all of a sudden, Ryan Cohen hopped aboard
He bought into the stock, this could not be ignored!

People realized the value of this great stonk
The price skyrocketed, the hedge funds in shock
But then the hedgies thought we cannot let this be
Retail traders, beating us? We’re losing our money tree.

So the hedgies decided they would take a stand.
Against “dumb money” (that’s us) and the WSB brand.
They gave millions to officials news outlets and more
To spread the story that GME would make everyone poor

Their FUD wasn’t working billions down the drain
They decided to restrict trading to stop the retail gain
No more shares could be bought, you could only sell
The problem is, we didn’t hear no bell

As the stock dropped to $40, I sank to my knees
The market was rigged and I didn’t have the keys
They change the rules when they want
As the ultra rich twitter warriors, gloat and taunt

The paper hands started screaming, we told you so!
In disbelief I saw the number -90% and below.
But then I realized a small and true fact
That I could actually survive these attacks

It wasn’t a loss until I actually sold
So I did something others, might have called bold.
I doubled down on my shares and lowered my cost
As the price continued to decrease all seemed to be lost

Then a glimmer of light started to shine through.
The headbanded investor bought more for me and for you.
This catalyst was all that the stock seemed to need
As the price rose, and hedgies again started to bleed.

The price hit almost $400 and dropped like a rock
$198 the chart said, the chat screaming what the fock
The price jumped back up quick and went back to even
I doubled my resolve, this is a stock to believe in

And now we have made it to today
What side are you on and with what do you play 
Make a choice, hold or buy if you can
Just make sure you are going in with your own plan.

GameStonk to the moon, yet again it seems
It can stay a great rocket, just through all the great memes
To the moon we may go, keep us In your prayers
At the end of the day, power to all the players

However there is still that small, but yet impactful percentile of people that still want to sell at 4 digits, and this I don't get. Those people say that people like me should stop guilt tripping people when they plan to sell at 1k or similar ranges, that the average Joe should sell when they have enough to live comfortably, that just a few people selling low is fine and will allow the people who are willing to go to the moon get there. However this is simply not the case. We together are a movement that can topple the hedgies that have fucked us in the past, a few ol' John's that want to take profits at 1k can easily become thousands! We are are hive mind! We proved it through the dip on the 10th, the moment we start allowing doubt and fear to get into our heads is the moment we are allowing the hedgies to win. This IS a mental battle, the floor is whatever WE choose it to be, it's our floor, not the fucking hedgies, as long as us as a community choose to hold, we got this! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

Don't be a dipshit that paperhands, it's as easy to say the floor is 50k as it is to say it's 1k, as long as us as a community believe it to be true. If you truly need the money, sell when you need to, otherwise if you can hold the moon, DO SO! Even if you end up having more than enough money than you need, give it away, donate to charity or invest in businesses you truly believe in, this is about us working with each other, as long as we work together we can milk these motherfuckers dry and use the money for a much better cause than they ever would! 

Also, for those of you saying saying to be realistic, what about this would have ever been deemed realistic? This is an opportunity to go full apeshit on the people who have more money than they can physically spend! 

This is the one time where being as selfish as humanly possible is the least selfish thing you can do!
