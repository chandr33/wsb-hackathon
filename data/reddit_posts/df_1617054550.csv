4,mg0kpm,"Sup you smooth brain fucks. Academy sports $ASO is nearly 40% float shorted. I reviewed all the financials and something is not adding up. They have positive revenue and net income and both have increased the last two quarters year over year. Their net profit margin is up as well as their operating income. Looks very undervalued in my opinion, and yet it is being shorted like crazy, any ideas why? 

They sell guns, ammo and outdoor equipment, all stuff that has seen a boom the past year due to the tense political atmosphere and pandemic. I picked up some shares this morning and hoping for some good earning call results tomorrow.

6,mg0mxf,"One day I was looking for long term value stocks, doing some basic screening, high dividends and low P/E ratios. Simple.

I came across PSXP, which has a extremely high distribution of roughly 12%. I looked deeply into the fundamentals of this company, finding it great. Extremely undervalued. They have strong relations with their General Partner (Phillips 66), and no sign of that ending anytime soon. They are a cash machine, with a safe distribution. There is no reason that it shouldn't have risen to about $55, where it was Pre-Covid. It is currently at $30. The units are really cheap. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I realized about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which unfortunately, they own about 25%. They are overleveraged about this, representing about 13% of their adjusted EBITDA. The problem with this is that the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) is currently under disputation whether it should be shut down, with most people agreeing that they will shut it down. DAPL took out 2.5 billion in debt, and PSXP will be forced to take their fair share of that debt. The lowering in cash flow, more debt, and potential fees for operating the pipeline without an easement, would most likely bring in a cut to the distribution, and the stock will lose value.

Doing more research, I found the pipeline is currently still operating. There is a court date April 9th, which will determine whether the operator, Energy Transfer, can keep it operating. If it is forced to close, PSXP will probably reach to the low $20s. Naturally this seems like puts are the way to go.

However, there is still a chance that they could keep it open, and the Environment Impact Statement still has a year until finished, so the opportunity for them to keep it operating for even a year is huge. This would probably carry the stock higher, especially without the worry of an dividend cut. The price would most likely exceed $38, potentially as high as $50.

I used to own, but I'm selling for a small gain. The natural bet would be options, in a strangle like pattern. The opportunity is too good to not play. The options are also really cheap, allowing huge upside. For me, I like APR 16 options and MAY 21. $35 and $25 calls/puts is what I will be doing personally. I already have various positions. I also have been trying to get $40 APR 16 calls for $1 per contract. The upside is huge and the return on investment could be easily 100 times on those.

[My current positions in PSXP](https://preview.redd.it/zaytype2h1q61.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72de4fb49bcec6ae5e6a49404802f85b643ceaf7)

This option profit calculator contains my current positions and my hopes. I feel like this is a bet that something will happen, which feels like almost a guarantee. However, if they push the court date back, or its a wash, I will probably have a hard time selling the contracts. But I feel like its bound to move.

67,mg1ioi,"Just speculation here, but I believe Tesla may be crashing extremely low in the near future. Since reaching $900 Tesla has been steadily falling lower and lower every week. If you look at the last five years of Tesla’s history, their prices SKYROCKETED when covid hit, as did most. This was before the fear of inflation, as stimmy checks were not discussed or introduced yet and the lockdowns were believed to be only temporary. Then came the stimmy checks, allowing millions to gamble with free money, further uplifting the market. Then came the gme/robinhood frenzy which further stimulated the market, with personal cash and first time investors. All this hype and free money has led to what I believe to be the largest stock inflation in the past 5 years ie. nearly every stock across then board is heavily overpriced. I dot not believe this will last forever and I think if we look at the past 5 months we can see this hype/free-money-frenzy starting to die down. As the lockdowns begin to end we’re going to be seeing a lot of people spending their money on other things, clothes, movies, dinners, friends, etc. and putting their stocks into companies that offer these things, removing cash from other stocks. It’s for this reason that I believe Tesla is going to return to near pre-covid levels in the next three months and as I’ve pointed out it has been in a steady decline for the past three months. I believe Tesla, as well as many others are going to continue falling in price as firms and big investors continue to cash in on first time investor bets, small investors pull out due to inflation fear and the wsb/gme hype dies down due to lack free stimmy money that a majority of its base relies on. If I had to guess, I believe Tesla will return to levels around the 150-300 mark in the next three to four months and stick. This could be a great opportunity for long term investors. We could wait for prices to drop from the inflated prices were seeing now but then again I may be wrong and right now might be the best time to buy Tesla. Its a gamble, buy now while it’s near its three month all time low, or wait for what I believe to be a pretty likely decline. But who knows i’m retarded.

68,mg1ivb,"What’s poppin’ fellas, hope you’re all doing well. I’ve got a short little trade thesis that I can’t get out of my mind due to how odd it is, and was looking for some second opinions on it.

&amp;nbsp;

In my spare time, I’ve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I’ve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there’s anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn’t that crazy since it could’ve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&amp;nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I’m not entirely convinced that this isn’t a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it’s not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&amp;nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn’t find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&amp;nbsp;

**I’m not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.
