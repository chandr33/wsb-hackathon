0,m1lj70,"I was reading through a fantasy book earlier this week and happened across this unexpected reference to 🚀 $GME  🚀 

**""Money is sleight of hand,"" Tehol said, nodding. ""Unless you've got diamonds in your hands. Then it's not just an idea anymore. If you want to know the cheat behind the whole game, it's right there, lasses. Even when money is just an idea, it has power. Only it's not real power. Just the** ***promise*** **of power. But that promise is enough so long as everyone keeps pretending it's real. Stop pretending and it falls apart.""**

**""Unless the diamonds are in your hands,"" Shand said.**

**""Right. Then it's** ***real*** **power.""**

59,m1lpty,"Alright. I got greedy and now I’m not sure how to play this out.  Playing the volatility, I was writing high and buying back lower making a % of that premium. Ape know bad, ape like money. Ape small fish, tiny ripple.  Ape sorry.  My goal was to make a little but always have some share free for that ticket to the moon. Well I capped my moon travel to the lower 5th quadrant because of greed. 

I sold the following covered contracts.  Basis on shares is ~ $80.
2 - 4/16 200 call ($44.99 - $8,998)
1 - 4/16 500 call ($13.39 - $1,339)
1 - 4/16 800 call ($11.99 - $1,199)

Because GME is doing exactly what we want and thought, premium is too high for me to buy these back without a huge hit.  Current values at close today:

2 - 4/16 200 call ($22,200)
1 - 4/16 500 call ($4,950)
1 - 4/16 800 call ($2,955)

What would you do?  Buy any back and suffer a lose just to reduce FOMO on going to the moon?  Let it be and just be happy Ape made great money?  Buy more shares at $250 a pop and prepare my mind to possibly be a bag holder again?  Roll them for more money but still the inevitable exercise?  Ape dumb. Ape deserve this for being greedy.
