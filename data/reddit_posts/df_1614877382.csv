XL Fleet already has a viable product and sales behind it.

56,lxpnjr,"Just loaded up on $10k in puts from $115-135 3/12 on $DASH. Lockup period is expiring and the float will more than double.

DoorDash‚Äôs strategy thus far has been to bleed money in order to come out as the market leader. This is not sustainable, especially after the pandemic, but people are buying the story inflating the stock. The industry faces serious regulatory headwinds and competition.

All of the insiders know this. Most of them got their equity for sub $5BB, so you KNOW they are itching to get out before the house of cards crumbles. Buy puts while they‚Äôre cheap!

tl;dr $DASH to Earth's fucking core!!! #MagmaGang

\*Additional DD per comment request

1. MULTIPLES: DoorDash is trading at a $50B market cap on $3B of revenue when Grubhub is trading at $5B on $2B of revenue. This makes NO sense and unjustifiable, but I will explain in point 2.
2. SOFTBANK PUMP: DoorDash is ridiculously high because it is a key investment of Softbank (also famed for it's investment in WeWork). Softbank's model is to pour money into companies and grow them at exponential rates, thus having economies of scale and elbowing out all competitors in winner-take-all markets. This would make sense in true natural monopolies, but food delivery is anything but. Softbank tells other investors that the growth is sustainable and once its companies reach the top, they will stay there. This growth is NOT sustainable. Once DoorDash is forced to turn a profit, they will need to increase prices, decrease driver pay, and decrease marketing which will force them to compete on an even playing field. This will drive any hope of maintaining higher market share out the window. The total market share will also decrease after the pandemic lifts. Their valuation will start looking a lot more like Grubhub's. Don't believe me? Look at their latest earnings where they missed EPS by $2.00.
3. REGULATION: Over the past year, there has been significant regulation
   1. Order When You Arrive banned in California: This was a key practice that accounted for the majority of restaurants on DoorDash's platform. Other states will surely follow.
   2. Capped Restaurant Commissions: Cities across the US are capping fees on what DoorDash can charge restaurants, this will surely continue to have an impact
   3. Prop-22: While still a win over the alternative, the majority of this increased regulation over gig workers is costly and will surely eat at profitability as other states roll out
   4. Italy mandating drivers be treated as employees: Internationally (where DD hopes to expand) governments are VERY anti-gig worker. This sentiment will surely expand.
4. LOCK UP EXPIRY: The majority of stockholders have their shares locked up and they got them when the valuation was sub $5BB. Softbank and employees can't wait to dump their shares and leave institutional investors holding the bag. They are all fully aware of point #2 and it will be a race to the bottom once lock up expires on Monday. I suspect Softbank has been artificially propping up the price so they would be eligible to sell on Monday (needs to be trading above IPO for 10 days prior to be eligible). About 35.8% of shares outstanding will be eligible for sale, those will ALL be sold. No one at DoorDash is buying",DoorDash is going to CRATER next week,0.76,1614877879,Mister_Twiggy

92,lxpt4x,"CCL and the cruise industry continues to get positive articles and ridiculous valuations from analysts (expect a +100% return in 2021!). Once they fully turn on cruises it will be too late.

Big cruise companies were a pretty boring value/dividend stock. They had modest dividends, profit ratios, cyclical on tourism and fuel costs. They had some fear in the last few years due to their horrific pollution and worries they'd be curb stomped into expensive upgrades by green initiatives, taxes, etc.

https://ycharts.com/companies/CCL/market_cap

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CCL/carnival/pe-ratio

In 2019 CCL bounced around a market cap of 30-35 billion, P/E in that ~10-12 range. In 2020, it lost 10B dollars. If was fairly valued before AND would see similar sales/profit going forward, they should have a market cap of 20B. They have a market cap of 31B.

They are heavily reliant on fuel prices. They have a great years recently when fuel was cheap. **Fuel ain't gonna be cheap.** 

They have a junk rating, the huge debts from 2020 they scrapped into have up to 11.5% coupon rates. Holy shit. They themselves called their debt obligations ""very punitive from an earnings standpoint"". That is a nice way to say ""we are going to survive but had to fuck ourselves to do so""

They are going to be losing 10-15% of their profit margin to debt obligations, limping along. They have as much as said they are going to try to pass off fuel costs and debt obligations onto customers, while competing in an industry against hungry scared companies needing full booking to avoid bankruptcy, forget profitability. 

This is a literal sinking ship. All these big guys are going to be eaten by new, small cruise liners stripping them for parts once business returns using their own ships.

People aren't seeing how much the stock is diluted and how horrible their debt obligations are. They are valuing it like its a high growth industry waiting to bounce back better than ever. This stock is trading as if its doing better today than it was a year ago. Really think about that. This company is worth 15 billion. **It could take a while for investors to fully see it though, so anything short term could get creamed.** It will be lots of semi-positive news, but the switch to realism will come as soon as operations start and the lofty  ""what if"" become ""oh no"".
