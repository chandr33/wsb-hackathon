I think I know why RKT has gone up so much, and I bought in at IPO, and have been üíéüôå ever since.

RKT is on the list of high interest float stocks, and it has been for some time, but I never talked about it. Every since what happened with DFV, the SEC has scared me. But now fuck it, it‚Äôs my opinion and god damnit we have freedom of speech.

Right now, as lots of you still believe in the GME sqeeze, there‚Äôs about 69 million (nice) outstanding shares. For RKT, it‚Äôs **over 100 million.**

What might be happening folks, is a squeeze of RKT. I could be completely wrong.

I am not a financial advisor.

The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.  


VWAPs can be treated as the ""true"" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a ""bounce"" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.  


There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.  


Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.  


In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.  


Happy Hunting!

I have an account at Fidelity with over 200 stocks that I bought during the pandemic.  I would like to slowly reduce my holdings.  think there must be a method to reduce my holdings based on comparing which stocks are more correlated, so that I end up with a diversified portfolio.  Some stock holdings are less than $50, some more than $50,000.  Obviously I consider the individual stocks in terms of the company's fundamentals and my expectation... but purely from an entire portfolio point of view, is there a tool that I can import all my holdings into and adjust my preferences, that will then prioritize which stock shares I could sell because they duplicate other stocks or are otherwise better candidates for sale than the other stocks... so I may incrementally reduce the number of stocks I own?
