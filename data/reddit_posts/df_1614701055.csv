Rocket Lab is going public via spac merger with **$VACQ**

&amp;#x200B;

Rocket Lab an end-to-end space company that delivers small satellites to low earth orbit at a high frequency. They already have 97 successful satellites launched. They have facilities and launch sites around the world. They are the 2nd most frequently launched rocket in the US following SpaceX and 4th most globally. They are also vertically integrated so where all the components are manufactured in-house, processing raw materials right through to launching rockets and satellites into orbit. Rocket Lab scaled to a monthly launch cadence faster than any other commercial launch provider!

I'm very excited about this company. They have a strong track record and lead by an experienced team. The space industry is a huge and rather unexplored marketplace with endless opportunities. Rocket Lab really set themselves up for success with their technology moat and now with additional funding. I think this is a prime candidate for the ARKX Space ETF (when that is out).

&amp;#x200B;

**Space Systems**

As mentioned, this isn't just a rocket company but an end-to-end Space company. This means they will also provide additional services such as:

Satellites as a service - from LEO constellations to high-complexity deep space and interplanetary missions

Satellite components - Anything that goes to space will have a Rocket Lab logo on it

Space Applications - positioned to access expanding space applications TAM

&amp;#x200B;

**Interplanetary Missions**

Here we see that they already have missions awarded and spacecraft that are developed.

\-Are you bullish on NVDA/AMD 🚀🚀🚀 Y/N

\-Do you think there’s a Semiconductor shortage? Y/N

\-Do you like 3x Leverage? 

\-Bears🌈🐻say: “ShoRtaGe MeANs     LeSs PrOFitS”

\-Yes, they might be constrained now, but it’s only a matter of time, Supply vs Demand. Semiconductor manufacturers will raise prices leading to increased profit that scales with inflation! Semiconductors go brrrr 💵 💵 💵 

Do you really want to bet against:

\-Stimmy?💉💰💰💰

\-Government (Nat’l Security) interventions?🕵️🕵️‍♂️

\-Increased cryptomining, gaming, and EV/AI chip usage? 🚀🚀🚀

Look around and see how hard it is to buy a current GPU at MSRP!

SOXL Just split 15:1, this isn’t really technically bullish sign as it moves 3x based off of its holdings, however: calls, covered calls, puts, etc are cheaper for you to play!

(620 —&gt; 41 per share as of today) 

...To me; it’s bullish AF, it means more people can play.

This is just one example of what they're doing to:

A) Hide shorts so that the public can't find the % shorted or any other information. This is highly misleading and is not aligned with the spirit of transparency we should expect.

B) Drive the price down on both AMC and GME to deceiving people into thinking that these stocks are perfectly stable and there isn't an imminent gamma squeeze.

C) Get people to bail out, and ultimately make people get bored and sell their stock. It's important to just buy and hold. The general trends for GME and AMC are almost identical - when one goes up, so does the other.

86,lw5t8a,I believe the reason the GME stock price is not moving is because they want us to forget about it when GME goes up or down there is massive coverage about the stock meaning more buyers are attracted to it. They’re trying to get us to loss motivation to continue holding and just sell at the current price. Don’t let them stall us out.
