Alright, here's take 2 of my attempt to create something for this board that has a decent chance of withstanding the poo flung at it: 

https://preview.redd.it/iha7qpttyul61.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b9a7d0e72824e095fbfe8d01b3f4a2804b3bc89

I understand a lot of people don't care, but if you want to \*try\* and swim with the flow, consider tech. analysis more like a language the big boys use to move stuff. It rarely works 100% because people are emotional, but, at least it can provide and educated guess where to get on/off so you don't have to stomach days/weeks of being in the red. 

It's still just a guess, and take a look at how it's playing out, not quite random is it. 

Also, scrubs will ask ""oh, but you can take any 2 points and --"". No, that just shows you have no idea what this is so read up on it. 

The daily high and daily lows are sacrosanct in trading. If you're gutsy enough you can buy the high and sell the low, but that's just being silly. 

I had $140s, sold at $208 (fearing too eratic movement), and re-invested half at $177 and $170 (keeping more powder dry in case it tests the days lows again).

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening again my fellow retards around the world

This is a followup on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzsnlk/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly/), in which I already announced i would do one, if there are people actually reading my post. Hope you are still interested.

**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**

1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.
2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u/Calithrix](https://www.reddit.com/u/Calithrix/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.

**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**

So lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u/Natural\_Profession\_8](https://www.reddit.com/u/Natural_Profession_8/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/).

And a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.

Also a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).

**Some other requirements for a squeeze**

* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:

1. 03/24 Earnings
2. 03/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)
3. find other possible catalysts in [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/) post.

* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.
* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.

**Some final thoughts**

* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.
* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good 🦍🦍🦍 with 💎🤲 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight🚀🚀🚀), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. 🌚

MO first come under my radar after I read this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why\_altria\_mo\_leaps\_may\_have\_huge\_asymmetric/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/)

In this post, the author argues there are 4 reasons to buy ($MO):

1. The company's core business is under-valued 
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes 
3.  Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized 
4.  Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO 

&amp;#x200B;

I like to include several more points on my bullish view on ($MO)

1. NJ just legalized marijuana. Other states are likely to do the same. I don't know about you guys, but almost every millennial that I know has no problem weed legalization. Sooner or later, the younger crowd will definitely outnumbered the older conservatives' opinions in marijuana legalization. It doesn't matter if you are in a more conservative state. Sooner or later, people will become more opened to it via media.
2. MO is mainly down due to 2 causes: fear of government completely banning vaping &amp; newer gens are smoking less. People are pricing $MO as if smoking rate will keep going down or flattens. Smoking has existed since before BC. However, smoking popularity has a more of a cyclic behavior. There were historical periods where people smoked a lot, and there were periods when people smoked less. \*\*(I forgot the name of this statistic phenomena, if an object has existed for a long time, it will continue to exist. How many books or movies were only celebrated for a short period? Twilight? No one talks about it anymore, because it fucking sucked.  Seven Samurai? It is a 1950s movie, but any film student is still required to know this film. It withstand the test of time. SMOKING? This thing has existed for centuries. It is here to stay.
3. High dividends. 
4. With the fear of recession, a lot of people are restructuring their portfolio. Guess what? Tobacco sales is recession proof. People are likely more stressed out, and had continue to buy tobacco during financially tough times.
5. Well, people are becoming more concerned about their health. Bullshit. Yes, this is true for the general public. But big tobacco's main customers aren't the people who smoked once every few weeks. Their main customers are the ones who can't control their addiction. Addiction will always be in our DNA.
6. Many people started smoking during COVID out of stress. Tobacco sales fell 7% during 2019, and was expected to fall 4 to 6% during 2020. However, it only fell 2 to 3 %. 
7. It just broke 52 week high today. This stock may gain some short term momentum and go to 48/49.

34,m0oks0,"Alright beefcakes- I posted a YOLO on PSTH a while back. I just wanted you all to let you know I still have a ginormous bet on this Team. I reached out to the mods to confirm I could post this and there was little feedback, but doing some searching it looks like people have been posting about it for some time.

PSTH is a shell company with 20.00 in a trust for every share. I.E. you are overpaying for a share with the anticipation that Big D Bill Ackman and Big Baller Jackie Reses will deliver us a stellar purchase.

I am not going to speculate on the targets because it could be anything, but I will tell you, I believe this will be the biggest news maker of the next 90 days as long as the market doesn't crash and as long as Bill delivers in the next 90 days.

Bill Ackman is a polarizing individual and has had questionable performance on his hedge fund, but as of late, he is nailing it. Bill turned 27M into 2B during the Covid crisis.  He made a killing on Chipotle, Lowes, etc.

Bill is not without fault, so it's good for you to know he lost his ass on Valeant and shorting herbalife.

Bills target will either be something that is private and well known, such as many on this list.

* [https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)
* Bills Target criteria is listed here
   * [https://pstontine.com/acquisition-criteria/](https://pstontine.com/acquisition-criteria/)

&amp;#x200B;

It's also possible that it will be a combination of a couple smaller targets that is combined into a larger entity, similar to what happened to Burger King.

Lastly, it is also possible that it is a subsidiary of a larger company, I.E. if Microsoft were to spin off a division such as Xbox or something of that fashion (It won't be this).

Bill is targeting a 10-15% stake with 5-7B of cash from this shell company.

&amp;#x200B;

# In my previous posts I outline the major risks:

* You're paying premium for a share
* This can drop to 20.00
* A deal could not materialize and you receive a refund of 20.00 for shares you overpaid.
* Warrants expire worthless if a deal fails to materialize- I do not recommend warrants at all.
* Bill has been wrong before.
* Market is scary and SPAKS are getting murdered as of late.

&amp;#x200B;

# The catalysts

* Bill is targeting a Q1 announcement but it might slip into Q2 or later, don't buy dumb options.
* Bill has held talks with tech companies so I'm optimistic this is techyish, but this is pure conjecture.
   * Bill spoke with Airbnb, Stripe and rumored Bloomberg.
* Bill indicated long holders of PSTH1 would be given right of first refusal (I believe this is the correct term) for PSTH2 IPO.
* PSTH2 Corp was filed in Deleware..... Why would Bill file a second acquisiton company if his first wasn't close to being done.
* Bill has provided the most investor friendly acquisition company to date so PSTH2 will likely be a similar structure. This isn't a catalyst but it is something that has helped PSTH maintain premiums as compared to peers.
* I previously indicated that all people should wait for a dip. I believe the time for dip buying is in the next 2-3 weeks. I bought some June 22.50 calls on today's dip.

God Speed and don't do anything Stupid

&amp;#x200B;

MODS- Don't ban me if this isn't approved. Market cap of the shell company is about 5X the minimum threshold.

36,m0okub,"Okay so check this out.

Options is a huge weight on market sentiment. 2 weeks in a row I have had 6 figures worth of options and thousands of contracts expire out of the money. Luckily I have just enough for next week to still do my damage.

First I'm gonna explain what matters with options. When buying and thinking about max profit in a moass situation you want the cheapest price per contract that Is closest to in the money but always ouy of the money. In times of low volatility alot like AMC s option chain you can find deep out of the money options for $0.01-0.05 per contract that means 1-5 dollars after the amplifier. Everyone should be putting 5% of their account onto the AMC $40 strike Friday the 12 expiration. If we did it will happen. Now couple things to understand about the options. When you bet 500% out of the money until the stock moves 50%is in your direction you won't even notice a change. Suddenly on the spike you will start to see massive gains, you can see my rocket videos from last week to see the potential. But the funny thing with out the money options is the last 100% of the 500% growth to in the money will be worth more in extrinsic value than the stock could ever be worth.

Think about that. You can turn $1,000 into 100,000,000.00 at 400% increase but you could turn $100 into a billion dollars if you hold that final 100%.

That's what I'm going to do and when I do I'm gonna throw it all into AMC and GME 50/50 to buy all your stocks at whatever absurd prices you apes can imagine. I think I might need help so if you could spread the word I'd appreciate it.
