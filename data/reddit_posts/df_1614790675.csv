If we take squiggly lines seriously, then patterns are often a tell-tale sign about the future movements of price action. Even if they're complete bollocks, crowd psychology often uses patterns as a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if the fundamentals are dog shit in comparison to the technicals (sometimes). Taking a look at the 5 minute chart on SPY I discovered an interesting correlation when it comes to one of the most recognisable patterns any technical doofus has in their arsenal, the inverted - and normal - head and shoulders formation. Notice the normal H&amp;S prior to the inverted pattern we see forming today, when measuring the normal H&amp;S from the tip of the head's wick, to the bottom of the neck's wick (reverse this order if the pattern is inverted) we see a price channel of 1.58% or $6.24, once broken through to the downside (a break below the neck line's trendline) we see an initial drop of a little more than 1.58% before a subsequent rally (as these things often do after a substantive drop), more often than not a break of a H&amp;S pattern's neckline is almost always followed by an increase or decrease of that pattern's price height (in the former's case, $6.24), the current inverted H&amp;S formation (Bullish sign) is within a price channel of $14.06, meaning a break above the neckline trendline at roughly $389 may see a subsequent surge to the upside from that price by roughly $14, which would place price near to or above the $403 range.

History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes, as they say.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Do the fundamentals back such a surge in your opinion? Is technical analysis for idiots (more than likely)? Are squiggly lines meant to be taken seriously (probably not)?
