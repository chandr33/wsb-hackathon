MVIS had an earnings call on Thursday during which the CEO Sumit Sharma was noticeably excited and mentioned that the company was for sale several times, including direct quote “In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring synergic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”

Here is a transcript of the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/34950d17-39cc-4cdc-87c6-b6714a06b89a)

And here is the audio from the call: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/static-files/48120c74-0702-4285-bfd9-e8334da64933)

I’m not going to post any DD because there’s already a bunch of amazing DD over at r/MVIS. I suggest you check it out.

There’s been speculation by longtime MVIS holders of a buyout for quite some time now due to their LiDAR (their product) being used in Microsoft’s HoloLens, but since LiDAR is also getting hyped as the technology that will make self-driving cars possible, some other players have emerged as potential partners / buyers. Again, check out all the DD on r/MVIS.

I’m posting this because WSB has changed my life. The only reason I have any money to invest is because of ideas from this subreddit and I want to pay it forward by contributing to the knowledge base. For anyone trying to find solid DD, sifting through all the posts, maybe not being able to afford something as expensive as GME - this is for you. I strongly believe in MVIS and think a buyout resulting in a huge jump in share price is coming. Good luck to all!

Man as a very social person when COVID first led to shut downs and we moved offices at my old job having to go from taking BART (for those Bay Area folks) every day from west Oakland to 24th Mission having a routine where I’d occasionally check my RH portfolio to discovering WSB in Jan 2020 and participating as a lurker during the first Tesla pump from like 180 to 300ish (not tryna shoot for accuracy here and fuck all of you who wanna pick this all apart) but seriously watching each and every post causally posting risks here and there and me following along once in a while then just getting sucked into this GME movement...it’s bene life changing building this com hog people who don’t know each other at all and honestly never seeing the same people twice...but the mere fact that now we’re all aligned on the same goal and the memes and checking each “what are your moves” post for the last year have seriously made this a very interesting time in my life. 

I know there’s a few of yall that are grumpy as fuck and will talk alllllll this shit and wanna start fights that fine bb lets make out in the corner later.

Cricut alienates customers in pre-IPO cash grab

So anyway, I haven’t a fucking clue how to see if stocks are shorted or any idea what the hell is actually going on. But, the whole GME deal made me wonder about another stock I own, which feels in general quite similar to GME, PartyCity. This stock has actually made me some money.

What do you know about PartyCity? Is it manipulated like GME was? Is it another floundering store they are trying to crush? And if so, why shouldn’t someone fuck that up as well?

Others have covered in detail the tools available to HFs (go further short, short ETFs, control the media’s messaging, etc) but I wanted to explore how HFs could be working together to play with the current 21 day timing for FTD by trading with each other. 

What prevents 3 HF players with a compromised short positions from coordinating selling short to and buying from each other by using algos at very specific fractional bids/offers? If you could plan this throughout the week in small volumes to not swing the price within the 21 day timeline and when FINRA data is collected/reported, couldn’t you “return” the short shares using a first out (short sale) first in (buy from HF pal) to return within the loose timeline and reduce the reported shorts for a stock? Could this be done in dark pools behind the scenes? Couldn’t HFs also do this in a high frequency way with large volumes over a very short period of time, let’s say 20 minutes, eating up lower limit sells on the way down to massively drop the price of a stock?
