53,lxi6c0,"CD Projekt has lost about 50% from the top because of the terrible launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and a hack. But let‚Äôs look at what has actually happened. 

**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**

 &amp;nbsp;

**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**

Sure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it‚Äôs still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.

The facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion‚Äôs share of total refunds.

Currently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30‚Ç¨ then its #7, #5 for +40‚Ç¨, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it‚Äôs still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that‚Äôs it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.

So let‚Äôs run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no ‚Ç¨250 collectors editions. Let‚Äôs also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let‚Äôs say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us ‚Ç¨690m in revenue and that‚Äôs more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that‚Äôs just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.

https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/

https://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count

 &amp;nbsp;

**The hack**

Source code was stolen but that‚Äôs not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that‚Äôs 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won‚Äôt be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.

Lost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.

 &amp;nbsp;

**The hidden gem**

Now let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I‚Äôm sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self‚Äôs they are alright but together they could be explosive.

The Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won‚Äôt be affected by it. 

The Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.

https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647

I believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won‚Äôt make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. 

One could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn‚Äôt popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.

 &amp;nbsp;

**M&amp;A**

A third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M&amp;A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.

 &amp;nbsp;

**So whats the price target?** 

Well the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.

 &amp;nbsp;

**TL DR**

Based on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.

The Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.

Lost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.

The combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.

An increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.
