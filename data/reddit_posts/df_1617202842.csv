35,mh8d08,"Early Feb, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.  

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.   
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (‚Üí not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x** 

  
**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float &amp; high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

  
**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

**Disclaimer:**   
I am long MKTY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.  I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. This is not a financial advice.

70,mh8oy2,"IMO PRLB is going to absolutely eat alive the machine shop industry in the next few years. Here's why

**What is Protolabs?**

Protolabs is a next generation machine shop. They take customer orders and then cut metal, print plastic, apply finishes etc. to spin parts back. Right now they are too pricey for production runs, but they serve the prototyping demand fairly well because they have insane turnaround times. They claim to be able to ship parts same day as they receive the parts for quotation. I've never seen that in the times I've used them, but generally you can get a lot of metal parts at your doorstep within a week of file upload. IMO they have 1 competitor, Xometry. I'll try to do more DD into Xometry but since it's privately held, DD will be a little more difficult. I've used Xometry before and in general PRLB just seems faster and to offer more services but I do need to do more research into Xometry.

**Traditional machine shop supply/throughput limited by human labor**

Right now it takes a lot of machine shops weeks before they start to work on any order, and the reason for that is because they need to have a backlog of orders in order to be profitable. Protolabs has cut out as much of the need for human labor as possible, and they are basically aggressively trying to have machining as automated as possible. Right now if you want to cut any metal part with a machine shop, you have a person in the loop setting up the machines, dragging the part from machine to machine and pushing go, etc. Protolabs still mostly operates like this too, however by servicing the high mix/low volume market Protolabs is not supply limited by labor. At the moment the cost of ordering parts through Protolabs is prohibitive for production runs (lets say anything more than 5 parts), however as technology advances and the costs of doing things via automated manufacturing processes decreases, there will be exponential increase in demand and Protolabs will be able to scale because they do not operate under a business model that necessitates them having a backlog of orders.

Also, if inflation really does pick up and the cost of human labor increases, at some point we'll hit the part of the S-curve where increasing costs of traditional machining exponentially increases demand for PRLB. So PRLB benefits from 2 parts of the exponential increase in demand- decreasing costs by their own methods, and increasing costs by traditional machine shops.

**They have a process for identifying and integrating the latest in manufacturing technology**

In general I think 3-d printing and other advances to manufacturing will mean the end of traditional machine shop services (currently 20 bil TAM), but it will be difficult to figure out which 3-d print manufacturers will be the real winners because there is a big difference between cool technology, and technology that addresses actual customer demand. PRLB has regularly been incorporating new technologies for years, and so they understand better than anyone IMO what technologies are worth buying, and what gaps need to be filled in order to streamline a next generation machine shop.

**Their automated quotation system has dramatically cut down turnaround time**

This is their real bread and butter. Right now with a traditional machine shop, you send them drawings and CAD files and they sit on their hands for a week and get back to you with any manufacturing issues they found, then you fix those issues and then the machine shop waits another day or 2 and then gets back to you with a quotation. Since machine shops need a backlog of orders and won't get around to your order within a few weeks to a month anyways, this back and forth of a week to get a quotation really isn't the longest path of a part.

With Protolabs, you upload a CAD file and their system automatically gets back to you with manufacturing issues immediately after upload. You can then reupload and, if it passes their initial checks, you get a quotation instantly. This cuts down the quotation process from 1 week to an hour. Additionally, Protolabs wins here because they do not have a human in the loop, so the cost for them to quote jobs does not increase with demand = higher margins.

Once the new wave of manufacturing really takes off, even if traditional machine shops incorporate advanced manufacturing they're going to be way behind because now their week quotation is going to be the longest lead for a part. And that factor is going to be the final üöÄ that gets this party started and will ultimately give PRLB a big share of the [32 billion TAM](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/machine-shop-services-united-states/) for manufacturing services. Currently PRLB does 434mil annual rev, but that revenue will exponentially grow at some point.

**Why I'm buying now**

At the moment I haven't come up with a good process for determining when these exponential increases in demand occur, however ARK hold's \~10% of Protolabs shares and IMO the main reason Protolabs has fucking tanked over 50% in the last few months is because people are convinced ARK has illiquidity risk in their holdings when they hold too much of a stock. üêª are absolutely fucking themselves shorting this shit - luckily for us it has given us a great entrance. I'm playing this with Dec calls because YOLO but honestly the liquidity in call options sucks so shares may be a better way to play this.

Future write ups will be me trying to baseline costs of production runs by uploading parts every few months to get a feel for how fast costs are decreasing, I'm thinking this process will give a better idea of when demand exponentially increases for PRLB

Hello fellow degenerates.

VZIO  IPO'd last Friday and it appears to have flown largely under the radar  which I'd attribute to all the other crazy shit happening last week. I  didn't even know about it until shares were already for sell. The shares  went on sale in the 17-18 dollar range, way under the proposed 21-23  range. Seeing this looked at the numbers and bought some shares because I  thought they were impressive.

I'm  just gonna throw it out there that I am not a financial expert and this  is my first time reading numbers from a prospectus document so if you  see any logical errors or bad numbers please point them out. I'll  largely be using the numbers I got from the prospectus document found  here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/)

As  of last Friday VZIO has put 15.2 million shares for sale on the market.  The company's total shares outstanding as of 2020 was \~144million  (these aren't on sale, just held by inside investors). At the current  stock price of 24.5 that puts the company's market cap at about 3.5  billion. According to RH VZIO's current P/E is about 4.45, which is  insanely low for a well known brand and a growth stock, which leads me  to believe the stock is majorly undervalued. The stock price could  easily quadruple to put the P/E around 20 which is more inline with  competitors.

The last couple of  years VZIO has transitioned from being just a hardware company selling  TVs to also becoming a streaming server provider. Because of the low  margins on this service it has become a huge income stream for them and a  source of extraordinary growth. Think of their streaming service like  Roku, but actually built into the TV. VZIO's income and revenue for the  past couple years were:

Total net revenue

2019 $1,836,799,000

2020 $2,042,473,000

Total gross profit

2019 $165,165,000

2020 $296,358,000

Net income

2019 $23,086,000

2020 $102,475,000

The  net income increase was largely due to the profits from their Platform+  revenue which has grown 304% from $36.4million in 2018 to $147 million  in 2020. The CEO states that the company plans to reinvest that money  into the hardware side of the business to develop better TVs. Another  bonus is that the CEO has deep ties to Asia manufacturing which has  proven to be extremely helpful in them securing required components for  their TVs and keeping their supply lines healthy while competitors face  shortages.

Taken form the  prospective document as of December 31, 2020, Vizio had $207.7 million  in cash and $625.8 million in total liabilities.

Vizio's recent financial results can be summed up as follows:

* Increasing operating profit and margin (They are making more money and making more money with less cost)
* Growing topline revenue
* Sharply increased gross profit and gross margin
* Growing earnings
* Reduced cash flow from operations

The  HD TV market is growing and expected to grow substantially in the next  few years. As of 2020 Vizio also made up the third largest brand of HD  tvs in American homes, so it has massive name recognition.  VZIO has a  lot of big rivals to compete against in this growing market that may try  to take out the smaller competitors. The name recognition might help  VZIO's potential for acquisition by a large player seeking to quickly  enter the Smart TV/connected home market by buying out an established  brand. In the past VZIO has shown it is willing to sale. It was supposed  to be purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago, but the deal fell  through.

In the short-term all  the stimulus will likely keep demand for TVs purchase high, which makes  short term prospects for VZIO look pretty good. The long-term potential  for growing their operating margins through streaming services, a ever  growing TV market, and the potential for buyout makes them a solid place  to park some money.

TLDR;

The  company is profitable, growing in the streaming segment, increasing  earning, and has all the right ingredients to become a big player in the  next generation of connected TVs by offering a TV + streaming service  similar to ROKU but in one piece of hardware. Also, there's only 15  million shares on the open market so a lot of demand can cause a big  increase in the stock price in the short term.
