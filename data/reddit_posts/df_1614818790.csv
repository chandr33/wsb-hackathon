**Retards**: Earnings have been fan-fucking-tastic.  Stock price is at a historic low.  Volume is WAAYYY up.   
 This is the 3rd largest company in the southern hemisphere.  Long call all day baby! 🚀🚀🚀

**Autists**: $ABEV (Ambev SA) volume is above 50 M today (up 56% from baseline).  Current stock price is about as low as it's been since the pandemic started but shit is gaining hella traction. You may wonder, ""What the fuck happened to this stock in the first place?""  Well, HQ is in Sao Paulo and Brazil has had [arguably the worst response to the coronavirus of any country on earth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-variant-in-brazil-overwhelms-local-hospitals-hits-younger-patients-11614705337).  Hospitals are consistently running out of oxygen, they hit record single-day deaths today, and the pace of vaccine rollout has been glacial (at best)...  But $ABEV has diversified assets and reported earnings much greater than expected for the past 2 quarters (also, smooth brain, they operate beyond Brazil).

""How could this be?"" It's true, the stock has inversely paralleled coronavirus outbreaks in South America.  But guess what's boomed?  [Alcohol sales](https://brazilian.report/society/2020/05/01/coping-habits-could-cause-health-problems-beyond-pandemic/).  You may be thinking, ""Oh no, I couldn't possibly capitalize on people drinking away their worries during a pandemic.""  Fuck you.  This flight is taking off whether or not you're on it.  Brazil's e-commerce alcohol sales have [nearly doubled](https://brazilian.report/coronavirus-brazil-live-blog/2020/05/18/alcohol-sales-online-almost-double-during-pandemic/) during the pandemic and average sales have jumped 4.3%.  $ABEV distributes a wide variety of beverages, but booze is its bread and butter.  This stock is about to take off! 🚀 I will say, however, long calls are the smarter bet as Brazil's recovery will be slow-going.  But here's something to keep in mind: This stock will **double** once it returns to pre-pandemic levels.  I'm in.

Position: 46 shares, 3/19 $2.50 call x 4, 4/16 $3 call x 3, 7/16 $3 call x 2, 7/16 $3.50 call x 2",$ABEV about to take flight 🚀🚀🚀,0.68,1614819320,RockChalkDoc
