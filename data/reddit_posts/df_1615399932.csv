What is Limit Up-Limit Down (LULD Pause)? On April 5, 2011, national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) filed a proposal to establish a new “limit up-limit down” rule to address extraordinary market volatility in U.S. equity markets. The Limit Up-Limit Down (LULD) mechanism is intended to prevent trades in National Market System (NMS) securities from occurring outside of specified price bands. The bands would be set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of the security over the immediately preceding five-minute period. To accommodate more fundamental price moves, there would be a five-minute trading pause – similar to the pause triggered by the current single-stock circuit breakers – only if trading is unable to occur within the specified price band after 15 seconds. On May 31, 2012, the SEC approved the NMS Plan on a pilot basis.

33,m24bi3,"**Dear Retards,**  


 first of all i want to say i enjoy this forum and i enjoy being part of such a retarded tribe. However since the Gamestop mania ive seen a lot of retards  here, that are even for my taste **to retarded.**  


What reallyyyy pisses me off is the amount of missinformation, fake news, trolling, zero knowledge but talking that gets posted by you appes.   


Lets start with the most famous one "" **Short ladder attack**"". I scrolled the the internet, readed a lot of finance books and ofc used google, but never came across such a bullshit. Some **RETARD made this shit up,** and probably a lot of other smaller retards trusted this misinformation and lost a lot of money.   


Second Point that really pisses me off, **stop manipulating people** u dogs. If i was in the US i would sue every motherfucker that writes something like "" BUY NOK, ITS ON SALE NOW"" just because he wants to pump and dump the stock ( Ive seen several user do this and looking into their profile, they had bought the stock wayyy overpriced and now trying it to sell to some other more retarded apes)  


**Stop screaming market manipulation** when the stock drops and come up with **WILD THEORIES**  why event XY will happen, but that Event can not even  be in melvins naughtiest dreams true. People are losing money because you retards dont think before u write.   


  
TL:DR  


**STOP WRITING SHIT IF YOU DONT KNOW SHIT**  
If you are stupid, its fine so i am. But then stop spamming shit all over the subreddit and just wait for a  next DFV with a fucking deep value information that will make us all rich but **NEVER NEVER** just write some shit that is against all laws of physics",Stop TRASHTALKING if you DONT KNOW shit,1.0,1615400029,IhaveahugeEGO

41,m24brs,"I started investing on Jan 7th of this year with $114 as my initial investment. I always thought investing was for smart people and old people so I never tried to start. I owned 9 shares of GME before the dip to $45.  I somehow convinced my wife to let me spend $2500 on GME which is a lot for us since we are saving for a house. I now own 45 @ 90.59. We've been living in the in-laws' basement for almost a year now saving It's been a long and tough year for us. But seeing GME rise has given both me and my wife hope again. Because of you guys and gals, we will be able to buy a house and start a family. There are a lot of good people in this sub. From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful. You helped my dream come true.
