3,m4qnhj,"We all know that Gorillas are endangered. But did you know that there are only 1000 Gorillas worldwide. 

This means that if every WSB user adopted 0.00015 gorrilas, we could completely corner the market on gorillas. 

This means that every single Gorilla in the world would be safe and looked after. 

However Gorillas are not the only great ape with volume issues. There are 7500 Sumatran orangutans worldwide. So once we corner the Gorilla market, it wouldn't take much to corner the Orangutan market either. To adopt every single Orangutan each WSB user needs to adopt 0.001 Orangutan. 

Infact we could buy up the entire Great Ape Market. There are approximately 500,000 great apes around the world Orangutans, Gorrilas, Chimpanzees ect. That means each WSB user needs to adopt only 0.071 of them to adopt them all. 

What do we do with the apes once we've adopted them? Personally I'm going to let mine pick my trades. Can't do a worse job than me. But they can paint.

In short this can't go tits up,

5,m4qoox,"GOGO 3/19 call options look like a fuse that leads to a box of dynamite that will set off a massive green dildo.   


this is similar to what we saw a few weeks ago with RKT and to a similar degree SKT last week. The thing is, both of these companies had positive catalysts upon earnings. RKT got more run because meme stock and higher short interest than SKT at the time.  


GOGO's earnings were kind of dogshit, price got run up on Thursday then completely collapsed till Friday but it did not go below $11.   


from the $11 strike to about the $20 strike there seems to be an insane amount of OI of options on a stock with a relatively low float and pretty high short interest. this would imply that a lot of these calls have been sold naked. not to mention the absolutely insane call to put ratio on this.   


this Friday is already likely going to be fucking insane with the changes being made to short selling and monthly options expiring for a bunch of different tickers plus seeing $PENN being added to the S&amp;P 500 along with everyone getting their $1400 direct deposits. not saying any of this will have any impact whatsoever on GOGO just seems like a recipe for some wild shit to happen with the market in general.  


disclaimer: definitely not financial advice  Im fucking retarded and eat crayons in my spare time so there is a good chance this is wrong so if anyone could explain how buying shares to cover the $11 calls doesn't end in some sort of spike then please enlighten my smooth brain.

The obligatory I am not a financial advisor just an amateur crayon eater. 🖍

The following are some tickers I am watching come market open 3/15 thanks to finding some DD or conspiracy from some of my fellow autistic sex workers.

**NIO - go thank** u/jameskwonlee **for this DD**

* To be added to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April. If this is relative to other brands they could jump almost 100% in stock price over the months following the addition to that exchange.
* William Li met with Sinopec (second largest Oil Company and owner of 30,000+ gas stations) in early February. During NIO day William Li announced a second gen battery station. This potential partnership would create battery swap stations at a butt load of Sinopec gas stations. Huge ENERGY profits not just vehicle profits.
* PT at $60 from Mizuho and $70 from Deutsche Bank.
   * PLAY FOR LEAP CALL OPTIONS and simply more shares
   * $70-80 EOY Options
   * $50 short term summer calls seem pretty easy tendies as well

&amp;#x200B;

**PLTR – why the fuck didn’t I buy sooner, might as well buy some fucking shares now**

* Stock is crazy hyped. Mainline that stimmy money plus Cathie Wood continuing to buy so why in the fuck have I been jerking off and not buying. My wife’s boyfriend is very disappointed in me.
   * Shares entry \~$25ish
   * Short Term Calls for YOLO sake

&amp;#x200B;

**RKT – thanks to** u/bosshax **for his write up. This ape appreciated the photos**

* Still a huge short position in this company with many expecting another squeeze
* TD Ameritrade is not allowing for short positions of GME or RKT at this time so all the bears can get fucked
* THE FUCKING TICKER IS RKT!?!? 🚀🚀🚀
   * Shares entry \~$25
   * Short Term Calls are fucking cheap

&amp;#x200B;

**UWMC –** u/itsguud **post was the main thing that got my rocket started**

* Maybe the wholesale all in addendum doesn't mean shit to RKT but it at least seemed like some petty shit I was down with.
* Being listed on new indexes on March 22
* Short interest seems to be around 11%
   * Low entry price \~$9 a share so could have for a longer hold to see if anything pops

&amp;#x200B;

**MVIS - intrigued from** u/mrbrightsied post on possible buyout tldr below

* Latest earnings call had the CEO talking about synergic alternatives including a sale of the company
* MVIS's LiDAR product is in MSFT's Hololens being hyped as the potential tech that allows for self-driving cars to be propelled to the forefront
* Jumped 40% last week in share price
* Bullish outlook on call pricing even 5 months out",Wendy's Dumpster Dive Cumpilation Watchlist,1.0,1615707818,Adfran1

38,m4qvtf,"Fractional shares are a recent trick brokerages have have used to entice people with small amounts of money to invest in the stock market. There are a couple reasons why you may not want to buy them:

(1) Fractional shares don't have voting rights. 

     You might ask, ""why should I give a shit?"" Well, for example, if you are invested in GME right now, there is an annual shareholders meeting coming in June and there will be very important measures that will be voted on then. Your vote, no matter how small, can have an effect on the company's future in the coming years. 

(2) You are giving instituions money to buy shares to loan out to hedge funds who want to short. 

You heard that right. Fractional shares are backed by real shares held by some institution somewhere. You think they will let those shares sit there? Fuck no, they will loan them out so they can get that juicy 1% interest on money they didn't even put down in the first place. 

TL;DR: Buy a whole share if you can and exersice your shareholder rights and screw the 🩳

In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring. 

That isn't how this shit works. 

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid. 

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published? 

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat. 

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

\-Live in Australia, my single parent lost her job during the 08' GFC, fortunately was able to find some stability. Thus I have a passion of rage against hedge funds that disrupted our lives.  

\-Graduated uni with a boat load of debt (though still under HECS).

\-Trying to get a land package with my partner this year. Our combined income would be 140k. 

\-Still scraping to get a deposit as well as an amount for the ring. 

\-Like many here, have many fond, loving memories of gaming stores EB/Gamestop growing up as it was my sole form of entertainment.

\*I UNDERSTAND WE ARE ALL APES AND RETARDS HERE\*

QUESTION - Does anyone see the price of GME dipping back down to &lt;$100 to start a personal BUY? 

FOLLOW UP Q. - What are the chances that the hedge funds call it quits on GME or are they simply waiting for the price to lower as I suspect before they gain their short value?
