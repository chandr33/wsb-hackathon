&gt;TL;DR: Uranium's spot price is extremely low, yet the demand for nuclear isn't just surging, **it is** **soaring**. Uranium equities--particularly miners--blow up ((pun)) in such violent movements that a 10x return is cute--**we are looking more like 200x. (20,000%+).** 

&amp;#x200B;

# INTRODUCTION

Uranium is a unique sector to invest in and not for the faint of heart. There was an “explosive” bull market in 2007 that found spot uranium up 10x and miners up as much as 240x (24,000%!). The worst performing uranium focused company 20x’d. In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear reactor melted down, and with that the use of nuclear energy. Seemingly low demand and what appears to be an inexhaustible stockpile of uranium has forced uranium prices to be well below the cost needed to make opening uranium mines profitable. However, the tides are turning exceptionally quickly.

We have been using more uranium than we have produced for many years, causing the stockpiles to dwindle. Demand is rocketing: We have more nuclear reactors in operation than ever, India and China are going all-in on nuclear energy with 30 of the​ 54 new reactors​ under construction. 110 countries have signed a pledge to meet net-zero emissions by 2050, fueling a race to conquer the sustainable energy sector. We have had a political blue wave in the US and nuclear is possibly the only green energy with sufficient bipartisan support for “carbon neutral” promises to become reality. Improvements in technology allow nuclear to play a larger role in electrical generation while making the reactors much safer than previously.

At its heart, uranium is a play on basic economics: Supply is down, demand is up. Stockpiles are drying/dried up and in order to replenish them, spot uranium must go from $30 to $50-$60 at least. This change alone will create ​*massive*​ gains in miners and if it goes beyond $60, the gains would be unfathomable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# THESIS

The world consumption of uranium is 170-180 million pounds per year, outpacing the average supply by roughly 25 million pounds every year. This gap has widened drastically amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with some of the largest mines closing temporarily. Among these are the top producing mines: Ranger in Australia, Cominak in Niger, and various others in Kazakhstan and Canada. Supply is dropping to a point where there is a 45-50 million pound deficit in 2021. However, demand is soaring. The US, China, Russia, and Emirates are building new reactors, and Japan is restarting its Fukushima reactor in a symbolic testament to the new paradigm of nuclear power. While there are \~50 reactors actively being built, there are many hundreds in the planning process. No logical developer will build a five billion dollar asset only to have it dormant, wasting away, and no developer can secure financing without locking in long-term uranium contracts. The three largest producers, Cameco, China General Nuclear, and Kazatomprom, are fulfilling their long term contracts by purchasing uranium on the spot market.

The spot price for uranium as of February 2021 is hovering around $30 per pound, and mining uranium is not profitable until roughly $50-60. Of course, production must meet demand and the longer this deficit lasts, the greater the opportunity for short-term arbitrage and long-term growth. With this being said, there is an obvious demand for new mines and a swelling pressure for a swift movement in the immediate price of uranium, allowing for leveraged gains in the highly price reactive uranium subsectors in mining and exploring. An increase to $50-60/lb should cause miners to go up 400% to over 1,000%. If the spot price goes higher than $50-60/lb, miner returns can be even more remarkable. Though it is not certain exactly when the stockpiles will run dry, many factors are suggesting that we have entered the beginning of a new uranium bull cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# CONTEXT

A. 2011 Fukishima, Japan nuclear plant meltdown resulted in sharp decline in demand and a glut of uranium, which pushed the price down to current levels.

1. For a decade or more, utilities have not entered into long-term contracts with miners; rather, they fulfilled their needs buying spot uranium, soaking up the excess supply

B. Increasing Demand  
1. More nuclear reactors being built

a) 13 Scheduled to start operating in 2021

1. b)  50 reactors currently under construction
2. c)  Plant upgrades are increasing capacity of others

C. Nuclear is a very good green energy

1. It is arguably more effective than wind or solar. One nuclear power plant produces as much energy as 3,000,000 solar panels or 2,000 to 5,000 wind turbines.

a) 2/15/21 update: The frost that blanketed Texas today caused major power outages throughout the state because of weaknesses in storage of wind and solar power.

1. Likewise, it is arguably the cleanest form of energy (granted, this is hotly debated)
2. It has become incredibly safe: with gen 4 reactors, which are largely built underground, failure is almost impossible and they are very insulated. It is even safe to live near them.

D. The United States:

1. Political Tailwinds:
   1. a)  Nuclear energy is one of the few green energies that both Democrats and Republicans agree on, which is a relatively recent phenomenon
   2. b)  President Trump had plans to spend $150M/year to acquire a strategic stockpile of uranium​. We are not certain if Biden will carry this forward, but he was very pro-nuclear on the campaign trail
2. Stimulus: It is expected to have a $1.9T stimulus package with an emphasis on green energy.

a) If the Senate needs 60 votes to pass a stimulus with an emphasis on green energy, a nuclear focus may be the only way to politically accomplish it

1. US uranium conversion plant scheduled to re-open in 2023
   1. a)  2/9/21 announcement
   2. b)  These are necessary to convert the mined uranium U308 to fissile U2325 to be used in nuclear reactors
   3. c)  There are not many of these in the world, and only one in the US
   4. *d)  This facility re-opening means the US expects the spot price of uranium to increase*
2. The US has 21 nuclear reactors slated to shut down at some point, five of which will happen in 2021. An easy and low-hanging fruit for a green energy push would be to delay or cancel these closures. That would increase uranium demand sharply in the short-term.

&amp;#x200B;

E. China  
1. Have been increasing nuclear usage lately

a) 4 of the 13 nuclear reactors to come online in 2021 will be in China, with three more scheduled in 2022

1. Nuclear generation is up 18%​ in 2020 as compared to 2018
2. Their five-year plan will be revealed in March​, which may be very  
pro-nuclear. This alone could be a catalyst for a very strong movement in Uranium miners  
(1) The last five-year plan was very pro-nuclear​, wanting to double nuclear usage over five years.

Decreasing Supply  
Because of the low spot price of Uranium, there are few/no new mines opening

and little exploration for new mines. It is simply not profitable to explore or open mines at the current spot prices

&amp;#x200B;

F. COVID mine closures

1. Kazakhstan and Cameco​: world’s biggest mines (60% of world’s  
production) - closed or limited production
2. Cigar Lake​: Canadian mine; closed and may continue to be while Canada  
gets the vaccine out - could be through the Summer of 2021
3. This accelerated the soaking up the glut of excess uranium

G. Technological Advancements A. SMRs

1. These are smaller nuclear reactors. Built largely underground, they are more resistant to Fukushima-like disasters, and can be built more quickly and in remote locations
2. Their versatility and lower cost increase the ability of nuclear to satisfy global energy demand
3. If populations sprawl post-pandemic, SMRs will be very helpful, as they need not have a large centralized population to be valuable
4. Video​.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

B. Update: End Game. Some who have peer-reviewed this document have argued that nuclear will ultimately be replaced by wind and solar, particularly at the home level. This may be true, but it is looking too far ahead. The play here is simply that we use more uranium than we need and in order to not have to shut the reactors, the cost of uranium must go up to make mining more uranium feasible. That’s it. Which green energy ultimately wins is another, unrelated, discussion.

1. Economics  
For it to be profitable for uranium to be produced, it must be around $50-$60. As  
of today, it is just under $30.
   1. With stockpiles running out, either the uranium price must go to $50-60,  
or we will run out of uranium.
   2. If uranium goes to $50-60, that will be \*quite\* good for U-miners
   3. The cost of uranium is a small part of the costs associated with running a nuclear power plant; therefore, buyers are not very price sensitive.  

   4. Between paying too much for Uranium and running out, the bigger risk is, by far, running out of uranium. So nuclear facilities would rather pay more for uranium than risk running dry.
   5. This is very different, for example, from a gold mine, where the consumers care very much about the cost of the gold mined, as the gold is often the most expensive part of the jewelry, etc.
2. Cyclical market

A. The uranium market moves at glacial speeds. When mined, uranium must be

enriched, which can take two years. Because of this, contracts are around 10 years in length.

1. The last contracting cycle was 2010 and 2011, so we may see new contracts shortly.

1. Has been a bear market since 2011 - Fukushima
2. Money is starting to come in
3. Market Manipulation in Your Favor...
   1. Because uranium is such a small market, hedge funds can create a bull market: https://twitter.com/Yellowbull11/status/1361761918302760963
   2. It is believed that this is, at least in part, what happened in 2007
   3. If true, there needn’t even be an actual physical shortage of uranium. One or two hedge funds can ​*create*​ the shortage and drive the miner stock up
4. Explosive Potential  
A. $19B ​*sector*​. As in, market cap of every major and junior miner together is $19B.

B. Without adjusting for inflation, the last bull run had it up to $140BN

VI. Another arm’s race. God-willing, this will not happen, but because the uranium from many or most nuclear warheads has been recycled and used, a demand for nuclear weapons would create a sharp increase in demand

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Things to look for:  
1. Sustained spot price in excess of long-term contract prices  
2. Signing of new long-term contracts between miners and utilities  
3. Nuclear element of China’s five year  
4. Nuclear details in US stimulus  
5. US canceling or delaying the closure of the 21 reactors slated to close

**Trades:**  
**1. Canada: Canadian mines are uniquely poised to benefit. China is a nuclear leader in terms of usage, but is resource-poor in terms of uranium. Therefore, China needs to import much, but won’t import from the US...but they will import from Canada.**

&amp;#x200B;

RISKS

1. Owning individual uranium mining stocks can have risks as the mining process is unstable and can be impacted by natural disasters (​Fukushima 2011​)
2. Change in political narrative such that nuclear no longer enjoys bipartisan support - nuclear energy is greatly affected by favorable or unfavorable government regulation.
3. Timing: This is the biggest risk factor in the space. Uranium moves at glacial speeds. Even if the fundamentals look great and a bull market is inevitable (which it appears it is), it may not take off immediately.  

   1. There is still excess uranium, which we know because the usage is still greater than the production - how much excess exists we simply do not know. Because it is tied to national security, nations do not publish the amount of reserves they have.
   2. An indicator that excess supply has dried up may be that spot prices exceed long-term contract prices. This has not happened, which may suggest the market correction is still a ways off. Update: On 2/12/2021, the “implied spot price” based on $URPTF, which can trade at a premium, went higher than the long-term contract price. Institutions track this and it is very bullish.
4. Development of new technology that makes nuclear fission obsolete, e.g. cold fusion (likely decades away), substantial breakthroughs in solar and/or wind and/or geothermal. Improvement in the efficiency of nuclear reactors makes them require less uranium. Normalization of decentralized energy solutions, which would not include nuclear.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TL;DR: Uranium's spot price is extremely low, yet the demand for nuclear isn't just surging, **it is** **soaring**. Uranium equities--particularly miners--blow up ((pun)) in such violent movements that a 10x return is cute--**we are looking more like 200x. (20,000%+).**

Many a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.

* Collusion!

No self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. 

My first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, ""you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for..."" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, ""Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special"" 

My second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. 

My third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. 

In conclusion

They are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.

60,m3um14,"**This is not financial advice!!**  You might think S3 Partners short interest data is suspect but they aren't claiming it incorporates HF's shorting ETFs.  So take it for what it is.  My [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0qxq2/latest_gme_short_interest_data_from_ihors3_at_s3/) showed about 13.8 million shares short vs 70 million shares beginning in January.   Also, I describe my take on the upcoming weeks [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu921a/dd_pros_are_buying_gme_on_this_datethis_is_the/).

Some even say S3 Partners is working with the HF's.  I don't care to comment either way but I will tell you they have a new scoring system for potential squeezes and GME/AMC both scored a 10 out of 10.  Those stocks are the most likely to squeeze out of every stock they analyzed which I think is all stocks globally (correct if wrong).  I'm contacted S3 Partners to buy the data so I will provide more commentary on the data if I do buy a membership.

[GME\/AMC are the most likely stocks to squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/2e6wn77ujom61.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc41bd75908976ac3d3fd31ad707dd77a479cfd)

Just b/c GME/AMC are rated the highest doesn't mean anything on the probability of it actually happening.  As far as I know, they aren't assessing the probability of a squeeze, just that it's more likely than other stocks (in their opinion) based on several factors.  ""A short is crowded based on several factors, but is basically telling an investor the amount of shorting in a trade, is there trading or stock loan liquidity in the stock and how much of the float is being shorted. The crowdedness of a short adds to the squeezability of a stock.""

**Implied Volatility (IV),** the implied 1 week move based on at-the-money (ATM) option prices is as follows:

**First Squeeze**: When stock was at $325 and the 1 wk option cost $125 meaning there was an expected move of 38% ($125/$325) up or down.

**Second Squeeze (current squeeze)**: 

On Monday (03/05) at close stock was $195, 1 wk option cost $30 ---&gt;  15% ($30/$200) up or down

On Wednesday (03/10) stock reached a high of $348.50.  The 1wk (3 days) cost ATM was $50 ---&gt;  14.3% ($50/$350) up or down

On Friday (03/12) at close stock $264.50, 1 wk option cost $47 ---&gt;  17% ($47/$264) up or down

**Third Squeeze (future squeezes)**: My view is this is repeatable so in the event of a collapse you should still stick around.

**The pricing in the Options Market says......**next week we aren't in bubble territory like we were during the first squeeze.  The first squeeze expected a 38% move in 1 wk, thats massive!!  Currently, 17% down/up is $219/$309 and double that is 34% down/up is $174/$354.",S3 Partners sees the GME short squeeze continuing!! 🚀🚀🚀,1.0,1615593579,AGeeeeezy

63,m3umya,"Sorry for having to do this, but I'm now one of the paper hand fucks and if I need to be banned from this subreddit. 

I initially joined the whole GME 🚀 at 10th of February this year, couple weeks after that damn squeeze. 

I continued to buy stocks to the point where I had 374 @129.01€ but after telling my father about the stock, hoping to get some kind of recognition or maybe the usual 'I am proud of you son.' He just told to close my shares and while I tried to explain that it was 'going to the moon' I couldn't just straight up tell him that I am an retarded ape like the others here. 

He told me that I shouldn't have been too greedy and that making 5 thousand out of 300 euros was pretty impressive, but I wanted more. 

People talking about this every share being worth 130k made me hopeful, a chance to just never have to worry about stuff like having to pay for rent and just having my own place while being 21, it was amazing. 

I managed to buy 45 shares at an average of who knows how much because i haven't checked.

But then the days went by and while I was still hopeful, my dad messed up, he heard some fucking Youtuber scamming people in quick 'how to get rich' scam and thought that the app I was using was that (I'm on Capital com). 

I tried to refute his claims, but he told me to close whatever share I tried to hold in front of him and to not mess with the money because as far as he's concerned, they're just digital numbers because on his time, he went to an actual bank instead of apps (gee I wonder why you didn't use an app of a phone twenty years ago). 

But yeah, at the end, no matter the reasoning, I'm still a paper hand bitch, but I guess that I can pay college now, I guess this ape will have to see the rocket go without me.

http://imgur.com/a/6zja7ri for the flair, I guess.

I had previously promised to make a video with myself acting like a monkey while quoting this subreddit, but given the fact that I'm one of the paper hands, I don't think I'm worthy of being called a fellow ape.","📄👋 here, 🙊 is sorry",1.0,1615593647,ClockPuncherTTV

96,m3uuwd,"&gt;TL;DR Everyone needs to calm down about daily prices, gains and volumes... and just hold. Remove your stop loss, set notifications for the upticks and let it go. Really. That's it. If you're holding gamestop stock long, you will come out on top *eventually*. But, please read and share your thoughts. I'm going to bed and I absolutely will reply to most people come the morning.

So, I've been following GME for a while now and ...

I think people need to be more confident. Not the ""100k isn't a meme"" kind of confident. But the calm kind. The rational kind. The kind which can empathise with everyone on all sides of this trade.

**People who currently have short positions have no exit strategy.**

What does that mean? It means if you go long on GME and they succeed in their transformation... you **cannot lose**. GME could literally be a ""buy and go afk for 6 months and return a millionaire,"" situation. 

There is a single loss condition, and that is the total collapse of the dollar. Pray that JP manages to keep pumping the eco before that happens...

There have been targeted disinformation and misinformation campaigns, I've personally reported multiple accounts who are spreading easily disprovable lies. I think it's an important time to remember Kramer's video. If you haven't watched it. Find it. It is *eye opening*.

But you just have to remind yourself that there is currently a battle between institutions on betting whether either long, or short, is the more profitable position for GME. And that in a war of attrition... shorts **cannot win if people hold their shares in a profitable company.** Look at Tesla. Millionaires were made by Tesla, and that wasn't even as heavily shorted as GME is...

This event isn't something any retard should try and pin a date for. **We all know one thing, shorts r fuk.** So we don't need a date. We need a trigger.

This is the confidence you need and the confidence we are missing. Say it to yourself. Literally think about what they can do if Gamestop succeeds? Shorts. R. Fuk.

This isn't delusion. It is absolutely rational analysis of the situation we are in.

I think the likelihood of Gamestop failing in its mission to transform into an e-commerce focused company is quite low. So low that, if you aren't already in on GME, it is **absolutely worth** even just a fractional share of GME even at its current price.

So what can shorts do against a company that is more-than *likely* bound for success?

**Hope that people sell their shares**.

That's it.

The **only** **thing** **retail** **can** **do** in this fight to help institutional longs is **tighten the float.** As much of it as possible. I think what long whales are *actually waiting for is retail to do this.* And retail *isn't*, because it's bruised, sore and a bit hurt by GME's volatility. We also have too many people day trading and flipping for a quick 5%.

&gt;So... forgive me for swearing... I don't think this is a YOLO and print in a week situation. I think we have to...  invest.

And this makes so much sense why DFV hasn't sold. He literally told us, we thought he was just joking. But he told us what to do. ""What's an exit strategy?"" We have to go long too. Once enough of us realise this and do it, **that's the signal for whales to pump.**

A lot of people on wsb are already calling it boring, saying that trading sideways is dull and where is the squeeze already. But, there's too much free float to attempt a squeeze. Think about it. Long whales will dump their capital to pump the price and shorts just open new shorts and... essentially beat the longs. Longs lose their value along the way and shorts gain capital they can use to survive longer. This is what we actually saw on Wednesday I think.

That's why we aren't seeing any whales jumping on. Whoever made that upward movement on Wednesday was premature and didn't understand the retail culture. In fact, it is highly possible that it was coordinated by the shorters.

Retail scares **easily**, because often it compromises of emotional investors who don't do research and don't think rationally. They see money go up or down and praise or panic. That's why we had a SLOW and STEADY run up the entire time before Wednesday. Our ally whales were trying to **build confidence in the retail trader** that GME is worth **holding onto**. There is psychology on both sides.

Retail needs to have composure and **not use the most scammy fucking feature of a broker: the stop loss.** In absolutely no circumstances for GME would you **ever** want to use a stop loss. It is a long play. You NEVER use a stop loss in a long play.

**You use the buy limit. You create buy walls.** This creates consistent upward pressure that cannot be plowed through by any number of short attacks. And here's the thing... **if they try to, they increase the number of shares they have to buy back from us**.

Stop losses essentially give leverage to short positions by giving them free downward pressure. **If people didn't trigger stop losses on Wednesday, we would have possibly seen the squeeze begin on this Friday. Today.**

Do. Not. Use. Stop. Losses. For. Any. Trade. You're. Going. Long. On. Not just GME. Any stock.

The available float for GME **needs to be 90% restricted, or more, to even attempt a squeeze.** That means no more than 5m shares available at any given time. That was the real **trigger** behind VW. The free float.

Retail is actually bigger than institutions, in terms of available capital. It is absolutely possible that retail can tie that float up **in a single day**. Once the institutional longs can measure that the float is tight, by seeing how volatile the stock becomes when they test it, they can move.

People are asking for whales to step in, but whales cannot ask anyone anything. Whales can't directly tell us what to do. They risk being prosecuted, shut down or imprisoned. They have to work secretly and have to try and build confidence in the value of the stock by slowly pumping it. Retail needs to regain its confidence and superiority in this situation.

**Our whales need retail. Not the other way around.**

I'm not telling anyone to buy. I'm not a financial advisor. But for fuck sake... there is literally **no downside to going long on a company that is highly likely successful in the future**. 

Yes yes, it can't go tits up. But really? What can go wrong with Gamestop? A team of e-commerce business veterans fail to push a cash positive company with high brand recognition in the largest entertain market sector into an e-commerce giant?

Have. Confidence.

If you're long GME. You're going to print money. 

The minute that long whales see that retail has tied up the majority of the float and refuses to let go... **we get our squeeze.**

This is **exactly** what Mark Cuban told us.

Remember and trust in your purchase. People who bought GME at 500 and won't sell, will very likely see more profits than people who bought at 20 and sold at 40.

Institutions who are short Gamestop already have accrued $7,000,000,000 of *unrealised* losses. They haven't lost that capital yet. They haven't closed their short positions. They will do anything they can to reduce that unrealised loss. But if Gamestop succeeds, they can't reduce that loss to 0. 

If retail gets behind Gamestop, that loss can only **grow, until they cannot justify it anymore and close their positions.**

In summary:

Believe in what the company will do. Understand the shorts can only *delay* or hope that a ""natural disaster"" happens. Remember that the float needs to be restricted for a squeeze to actually happen. 90% or more. Understand that our ally long whales are relying on retail, not the other way around. And refuse to use a stop loss when you're going long. Do the risk:reward in your head. Don't be emotional. Don't over-extend with your investment so you become emotional. Invest what you can and hold it. Like GME or not, this is history in the making. Make sure you're on the right side of it.

When the launchpad is built, the whales will fire us like a beautiful rocket straight into the heavens. We aren't in the rocket. We ARE the rocket.",What is THEIR exit strategy?,1.0,1615594360,admiral_asswank
