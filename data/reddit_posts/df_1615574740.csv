I highly recommend reading the Prequels before going ahead with the sequels. Disclaimer, this sequel will not be as good as the origin post!

So, shorts are still winning with the short volume ratio being 30.17 Yesterday(Fintel). Although some of the shorts had to cover to avoid paying the dividends, yesterday they got back at it with the ratio mentioned before. It's really inspiring how relentless they are! In addition, the borrow rate rose to 8.86%(Fintel).

**As of 03/11/2021(Fintel) the Short Volume Ratio is 30%.** To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. 

&amp;#x200B;

[03\/11\/2021\(Fintel\) the Short Volume Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/ej84xpck5nm61.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc67440203d544cba39db6f3db68f0d3200870c3)

The only reason I could come up with as to why this is being shorted so much is due to institutional holders not wanting it reach the 10$+ where a Gamma squeeze could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls. This would results in their premiums for Calls being lost(all opinion). Remember that there is a large institutional stake in $UWMC.(More on this paragraph in part 2)

**(NEWS)** Anyway, if you missed the recent [$UWMC news](https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/76503/larger-broker-shops-already-signed-addendum), United Wholesale Mortgage reported that some large broker shops across the country have signed the UWM all-in addendum representing over 90% of broker shops who will no longer work with Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, exactly one week after the Facebook Live announcement.

The All-In addendum states that after **March 15**, broker-owners continuing to do doing business with UWM means they can no longer do business with both Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation.

 ""The support and appreciation we have received over the last week has far exceeded our expectations,"" said Mat Ishbia(CEO).  ""Our partners understand the importance of working with a lender focused on the future growth of not only their business but the entire channel.""

**In summary, I'm very excited for next week. It'll prove to me either the CEO is as good as I expect him to be (He's a big reason why \~48% of my portfolio is in it) and he'll capitalize on the rare opportunity of a Gamma squeeze which could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls (more on that in Part 2), or I would be very disappointed.**

 **I wouldn't buy any $UWMC 03/19 Calls anymore** because they are useless in my opinion towards the stock and have a high **risk of expiring worthless (More on that in Part 2).** On the other hand, **I would only buy shares** and maybe leaps if they are cheap enough.

Perhaps there are also concerns about orders executing quickly enough to avoid unintended volatility?

69,m3oh6y,"Wheels Up - Democratizing Your Carbon Footprint

Wheels Up Inc. will start trading on the stock market soon. The leading brand in private aviation is worth $2.1 billion and has $790 million in cash to spend on growth. This company is a prime example an anti-climate investment. Platform members and investors should demand that Wheels Up cleans up its carbon impact. 

Wheels Up‚Äôs growth strategy comes at a high cost for the planet. Private aviation is the most carbon intensive form of transport per capita - 8 to 10 times dirtier than flying commercial. This is due to burning jet fuel, fewer passengers per plane, and shorter travel distances compared to commercial flights.

The company doesn‚Äôt address this issue. It doesn‚Äôt publish a sustainability report or quantify carbon emissions. In fact, ‚Äúclimate‚Äù and ‚Äúcarbon‚Äù go unmentioned in its investor presentation. This is unacceptable for a public company and its investors including Delta Airlines, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and hedge funds Third Point and Luxor Capital should hold the board to a higher standard. 

Luckily, a solution exists - science based carbon offsetting. The company should facilitate investment in carbon offsets that buy down the Green Premium of sustainable aviation fuels and direct air capture solutions. Kenny Dichter, the firm‚Äôs CEO, and team should follow Delta Airlines‚Äô lead by procuring a portfolio of carbon offsets and committing to carbon neutral growth. Private aviation can support innovative solutions to decarbonize the airline industry because the cost of carbon offsets make up a lower share of ticket prices. Wheels Up can integrate carbon offsetting as part of their subscription service, allowing customers to offset each hour that they fly. 

Wheels Up‚Äôs well-heeled customer base can afford higher quality carbon offsets. The offset program should be the default for subscribers, with an option to opt-out. This would nudge customers towards sustainable private aviation with proper education and disclosure. Offsetting the carbon footprint of a customer flying 20 hours a year would cost less than 10% of Core membership dues. 

Competitors such as NetJets, VistaJet, and XO already have carbon offset programs. A sustainability initiative will enhance Wheels Up‚Äôs differentiated brand. Wheels Up should democratize aviation and accelerate decarbonization.
