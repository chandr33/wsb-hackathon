I‚Äôve been doordashing and doing what I can to make income, I even tried investing when I can in stocks and had to pull it all out

11,mfjj6j,"I am currently trying to decide between becoming an engineer (software or mechanical), or getting a finance degree (at a great business school) and become a commercial real estate broker. The difference between the education is that I didn't apply to any engineering schools so I would go to a community college then transfer. However, if I do the finance path then I will graduate from a great school and most likely get a lucrative job after. 

Additionally, how can I tell if I like either career? I watch YouTube videos but I feel I need to be in person and shadow someone to tell if I like the career. I also feel engineering has more income potential than finance, especially since it is a 'really' hard skill that has potential to innovate the world, in my opinion. I also feel engineering has slightly more merit than finance (not hating on finance). I would be glad to hear anyone's thoughts on my situation, I am currently 18 and will need to choose my career path soon, thanks.",Engineering or Finance?,1.0,1617000380,CharacterPainter3

Coming off a great last year ASO is set to announce its earning report March 30th. Covid will likely have had an impact, but the word on the street is the stores have been packed busy since opening back up again. 

[Previous earning reports](https://preview.redd.it/s825pxkaxwp61.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c8e9e0785bf85914370ba4bfee78c795e992ab8)

With strong financial performance, and a increase in net profits. It's likely the earning report will go well despite covid.

ASO is also sporting the 4th highest number of outstanding shorts on the NASDAQ.

Also with ASO selling AR's, next Zombie apocalypse, this store is going to be one of the most looted stores ever. Just saying :D

Meaning if you into this kind of investment strategy, the stock could do very well in the near future. 

I have 300 shares currently of ASO so I am of course a bit bias (for visibility sake)

Also there is no financial advice here, research the stock yourself and see if it fits your interests and risk tolerance.

25,mfjrpr,"So far, two major banks have announced major losses in relation to the liquidation of Archegos' trades: Nomura and Credit Suisse. 

Here is Credit Suisse's statement released early this morning: *""A significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions. While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month. We intend to provide an update on this matter in due course. ""*

Brace for further impact today in stocks which were already greatly affected on Friday, DISCA, VIAC and the likes. Reading this morning that Archegos' books still has ""USD 22bn to USD 30bn"" to liquidate (""sources""). CS' statement tends to confirm liquidation is - indeed - not over yet.
