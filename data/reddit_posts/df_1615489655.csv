Everyone knows EV stocks have been jumping past couple months and one important factor is finding those few companies who will rise on top in the next few years.

I feel like GOEV is very undervalued for how far along they are. After digging around a little bit they are going through with a unique design for a new bubble truck ev. This ev will have top of the line specs for a cheap price comparable to cybertruck with some added bonuses in terms of power torque etc...

The company is eyeing sales of 2.5 billion by 2025

There is wide acceptance for the leadership and overall company ideas

They are also working on some delivery vehicles which many optimists (myself included) believe other companies will slowly adapt to and they even have hopes for personal driving vehicles for systems such as Uber/Lyft which is loaded for a potential influx of cash with basically 0 downside.

I couldn’t find much more numbers/statistical data like some other retards can, however the overall feeling with this stock is short term spike in hopes they can deliver on their high aspirations.

This is not financial advice but im moving over 1/3 of my portfolio ($800) into this stock over the next few weeks. Eyeing under $15 for entry

First post was banned, perhaps due to yt link, I will try again without it, please don't ban me!

Just my POV:

That  FOMO thing is a part of you that really wants the best for you - the  biggest gains.However, too much greed is not really a good thing while  making a bet. If you want your bets to have power, you can learn to  control your FOMO power, learn to control yourself.

Firstly,  you need to understand where your FOMO came from - it might have been a  glance at your best life from your current perspective. This vision  might have been enough for you to screw everything you learned about  market, it did not matter at all -  the prize was so big, so you put  your finger in a pile of shit without checking the validity of the bet.

Well,  now that you admit a bit of what it truly was, how can you hate  yourself for FOMOing? You should hate yourself for being lazy and for  hating yourself because of your FOMO! You just learned how to learn what  you truly want and what blocks your path - seems to me like it's a lack  of money. However, as we used to say, money doesn't grow on tree -  right now it needs power to be transfered to another account and those  in charge take a lot in between transaction. But you have something they  don't steal yet in most of our cases - it's your time use to play games  and enjoy life after spending more of your  time on your job and  responsibles. It's also the time you use to better  yourself(but I don't believe it's the case on this sub tho). This time  is the time you can spend better and learn to spend it even better, just  to reach your dreams eventually.

Of  course, You only need to give something in exchange, if you really want  to straighten your path, and if you do, remember that you should pay  big, or else you might get scammed by others who paid more to pay less  in future, and many had a lot to pay upfront, yes, the world isn't fair,  some are born with only time on the table, some are born even without  it.

Anyway, right now, in my opinion, you have two options:

* Hate  yourself and promise not to use market or simply cry and wait for next  FOMOs then eventually go back to lying to yourself about liking your  life if you are not one of few lucky ones.
* Learn a fucking lesson and admit you are a little bit of a puss every day, start to get prepared for your next FOMOs.

Now, let's say you decided not to be a little b&amp;\*ch this time, what could you do? How to direct spending your time?

Well,  it's a long term investment - you learn how to learn, then you learn  how to learn about market, then you learn about market, you talk with  people inside, your read your subs, you read your DDs even if you don't  want to invest yet, you are constantly around the things you want to do  and you think of what it is that has an impact. Then you learn more on  this topic.

Your life could really  turn around slowly, step by step, to the path of your perfect vision,  the vision you are likely forgetting day by day. FOMO woke up part of it  a little. Believe in FOMO. It can do a lot and all you need to do is to  be fair with yourself. Do you want your life to be noticably better? Or  do you just want to earn big cuz others did? Well shit fam, you real  stupid and godluck on your weak ass bet. But if you are willing to put  effort for long term happiness, stick around for next FOMO moments, see  where you could have bought, what actions would lead you to a loss, have  your money saved, but ever panic buy unless you prepared yourself for  panic buying.

Remember to be fair  with yourself before and make a solid decission whenever you get a first  big impulse.  If you did not prepare well - forget about your FOMO  until tomorrow. Yes, you could've earned, but most likely you would've  lost again, this world works better if your decissions are critical.  Wake up fine the next day then use your pastFOMO frustration of missing  out(also FOMO) to prepare for a next dive.

This  way I don't lose anymore on a first step. I realise there's many more  to come, but my first FOMO losses from month ago did keep my around  firmly and I do not intend to sell for small numbers. I lost my cash  when I FOMO'ed month or so ago, right now all I have are stonks, not  money, I accepted my ""loss"" so I can only win if I invest my time along  with it, as I don't only consider money a prize. Hodling has no bad  outcome from my current POV and I really like this mindset.

Goodluck to you all!

PS:  This sub might want all the best for its apes, but not everyone can  just simply join the club. Be realistic - perhaps we are not retarded  enough to easily get rich on completely out of blue YOLOs, like some  autists here. I think it's because even tho we are all born retarded,  the world straightens us too much and makes us forget who we really are.  Gain strenght to embrace your retardness, become a part of a thing, not  just a FOMO sheep.

UPDATE: Organigram shares rocket 30% as British American Tobacco buys 19.9% stake, to cooperate on CBD products


Mentioned:	BTI OGI
Ciara Linnane 

Organigram CEO: BAT has the management, R&amp;D, consumer insight and regulatory expertise to help Organigram pursue its goals 

Organigram Holdings Inc.'s U.S.-listed shares soared 30% Thursday, after the Canadian cannabis company said it has received a C$221 million ($176.6 million) investment from a unit of British American Tobacco PLC. 

The tobacco company has subscribed for about 58.3 million shares of Organigram (OGI.T), equal to a 19.9% stake at a price per share of C$3.792, based on a five-day volume weighted average price on the TSX ending March 9, 2021. Organigram's U.S. shares closed Wednesday at $2.89, while the TSX-listed stock closed at C$3.62. 

As part of the deal, the companies have entered a product development collaboration agreement, and will create a Center of Excellence to work together to develop the next generation of cannabis products, focused initially on CBD. The center will be based at Organigram's indoor facility in Moncton, New Brunswick, which holds the Health Canada licenses required to conduct R&amp;D on cannabis. 

""Both companies will contribute scientists, researchers, and product developers to the Center of Excellence which will be governed and supervised by a steering committee,"" the two companies said in a statement.

Organigram Chief Executive Greg Engel said it has been selective in choosing a strategic partner, but that BAT has the management, R&amp;D, consumer insight and regulatory expertise to help it pursue its goals. BAT head of research Dr. David O'Reilly said the move will help the company as its moves to lower risk alternatives than combustible cigarettes and expands into new product lines. 

The companies will each have access to each other's intellectual property. BAT will have the right to appoint 20% of the Organigram board, as long as it maintains at least 15% of its outstanding shares.

Organigram is expecting the deal to help it expand overseas including into the U.S. market. There are growing hopes that market will be cracked open under the administration of President Joe Biden, which has pledged to reform strict cannabis laws that continue to classify the plant as a Schedule I drug, grouping it together with heroin. 

That has hampered the development of the legal sector, which is mostly limited to those states that have legalized for medical or adult recreational use and left companies mostly locked out of the federally insured banking system and capital markets. 

In February, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would make reform legislation a key priority in the current Congress, (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cannabis-stocks-rally-after-chuck-schumer-leads-drive-for-reforms-that-will-end-federal-prohibition-11612292635?mod=cannabis-watch) bolstering hopes for an end to federal prohibition and helping to fuel a broad-based rally in the sector.

""We view the strategic investment as a win for OGI, but note theagreement does not allow for co-commercialization (though we believe this could be added over time),"" said analysts at Alliance Global Partners, who raised their price target on Organigram stock to C$ 4 from C$2.25, but stuck with a neutral rating. 

""In addition to product development, we believe OGI could benefit from BAT's trove of consumer knowledge around preferred product formats, to be utilized within Canadian &amp; other markets,"" they wrote in a note to clients.

Organigram shares have gained 119% in the last 12 months, while the Cannabis ETF (THCX) has gained 160% and the S&amp;P 500 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote)has gained 44%.

ACB is uniquely positioned with a supply chain and experience dealing with countries with similar climates. Aurora is the second largest cannabis company in the world by market capitalization and consistently ignored. While normally a negative, ACB recently filed a prospectus for raising an additional billion dollars. Stock dilution is certainly a consideration but it is likely it is funding to expand operations, this is not money to keep the door open.

This is huge for two reasons:  AFRM growing at 100% and FSRV doesn’t have to spend on marketing or customer acquisition.  From a customer experience perspective it shows up as Affirm Connect and not FSRV...it’s like uberX for BNPL.  Valuation is a joke; you can get $40 per share is under 5x 2022 revenue for a business with 100% growth that is pooping cash and going to pay a dividend (when does that happen in growth tech?).  Two people tried to buy this before the SPAC swooped in:  CURO (45% owner) and another party (not identified by sounds like RCII).  CEO is a killer and CFO is amazing...this could have IPO’d but they had a gun to their head with hostile buyout offers.,FSRVW: 50% of my IRA,1.0,1615490408,GomorrahInlet
