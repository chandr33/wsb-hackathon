10,m38g2c,[removed],Cryptostar stock has been the best stock for me this year. Increasing 100% a day. Today they had another institutional investment closed. I can’t wait to share this with you guys.,1.0,1615519378,Difficult_Ad_656
11,m38gsw,"So this isn’t financial advice and the only things I know about technical analysis are from internet research and trend observation the past couple years, but I’m interested in getting some input from anyone that wants to discuss something other than GME. I’m still hodling GME and truly do not want anyone to sell for any reason until the tendies come in a big way, but this is not GME related. I’m also a bit newer to Reddit so I have screenshots at the ready but haven’t quite figured out how to include them yet...

I’m long on $HASI (they invest in sustainable infrastructure like renewable energy) and have been watching MACD, 20/50/200 day EMA, OBV daily for large order moves and monthly for trend deviation, and RSI usually at a 3 month interval. HASI has been in a short term down trend by all indicators but the 200 day EMA has still be trending up long term, and I think all signals just reversed today pointing to another climb. 

From OBV at close/AH, Theres significant positive volume which seems to be bullish for the days to follow. 

Looking at a 1-3 month view, Price also closed today above both the 20 and 50 day EMA (20 day is just below 50 day still but slopes are turning), and above $60, which has acted as a support/resistance level. MACD lines also turned today, turning histogram green for the first time since 1/14. On top of that, RSI just crossed over 50 again for the first tome in over a month looking at 1 and 3 month charts, not quite as sharply as I would like, but seems to have more than just grazed the line. 

More on a macro scale, the OBV over the course of the downtrend hasn’t been as significant as the price movement or previous upward OBV, and the price stayed above the 200 day EMA so far, which makes me think it’s about to start heading up again. 

The next major resistance level seems to be $70, which is where the price sat for a few days before retreating to as low of a close as 51.26 earlier this week. My thought/hope is the short term down trend just for reversed and the price will March through $70. 

If anyone read through to this far, I’d love to hear your feedback if I’m just delusional and reading this all wrong or onto something here. My background is in engineering, not any kind of trading or financial analytics, so this could easily all be wrong but I love constructive criticism.

$Ride or Die II

Goldman Sachs gave a PT of $31 BEFORE the partnership with NBC’s The Profit Nascar enthusiast, Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis’s 200+ locations 24/7 service and sales leverage.  

Don’t you love how everything acquired from Lordstown is done so efficiently?  Meanwhile,

JPMORGAN gave a bearish hit piece out right AT the moment Lordstown’s stock was at the tripple top on the chart.  EXACTLY AT IT : 
They bought the dip.

Biden slipped in one of his first economic going electric announcements regarding the “retooling” loan him and Obama did to bail out auto... ... when that loan was themed around WAGEs not tooling.  
—- Just so happens, Lordstown has applied for a tooling loan, “the same kind tesla got”.. putting the project “on steroids”... Burns said.

unit economics should be ridiculous with 15000 less parts, costing less to buy &amp; own..

The hub motors is the only thing all the EV’s don’t have and IS IT not interesting how ARK invest is diamond handing Workhorse as they are the one who made the deal with Lordstown to use that technology for a percentage of the co and 1% of each endurance profit?  
I feel like if WKHS gets the bid (ya that’s still a thing actually) Lordstown might just merge with them and those 250+ patents on Drones.
done editing this rant...

The 6 CEO’s that we’re once listed on Ride’s site have since been taken off the site, are globally ready to fight the good fight and GM must have known it.. here you go let’s help set up all our equipment with you and give you a loan you already paid off for the 2nd biggest factory in the automotive industry.. 
They’re going to need more factories... aside from 2nd biggest battery plant there too.. tesla being 1st.  There’s much to the story we don’t know.
Like in Jack Spencer’s interview where Burns was talking about the 100k preorders foreshadowing it does not include municipalities, gov, Fed, police, town, state vehicle orders.. ya know the ones Biden says he’ll be replacing their vehicles with.. 
The race mid April.  (They can make the batteries go as long as they want it to) 
Safety ratings coming.
The started from the bottom now we here story line.  Pandemic born Endurance..
The Q2/Q3 van/Camping World RV prototype ... the Solar Panels powering the factory even..
The clear lane of all EV work trucks untapped.

It’s performance .. doesn’t even belong in the segment it’s going to be compared with its advantages and is 17k less.. the wheel technology can move sideways.. but no one is talking about that yet also.

Oshkosh bid has been halted. 
Good thing the Dems really hammered down postmaster during the pre vote setting the stage for what we all already knew.. no not just Workhorse, they‘re going to need to do something to make them look good.  
And Has any other EV’s visited the White House?
It’s had and always will be about the money, so don’t get political, it’s a waste of everyone’s energy and is racist.
Why is JPMORGAN bashing Lordstown and pumping Fisker and Goldman doing vise-versa?? 
Look at the Short interest on the closest 1st to Market all EV 0 emissions fleet Truck..  
Buy that dip.
“Work for it” that’ll be a fine narrative to the unemployed after getting our country highjacked on a super flu and the media is going to need to start shouting something positive after all the garbage they’ve been feeding for so long... and to be honest Steve Burn (co founder of Workhorse, CEO of Lordstown) earns it.  These are good people, in a good community, working on a worthy project, and they love what they do and work hard on doing it.  Like.. the DD you’re welcome to do, it’s all there.
If you’d like to buy Tesla’s competitor in the EV sector take a good look at this ride.. rumor has it they’ll be working together too.
