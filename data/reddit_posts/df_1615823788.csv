32,m5nyq4,"It has come to my attention through complex study that Pink Floyd actually left signs of the rise of GME in one of their *lesser known* works: The Dark Side of the Moon   
  
[Heart Beat Pattern](https://i.imgur.com/jYsiuaf.png)  
  
Many of you will immediately see it here, because you are all abunch of chart watching apes.  When compared to recent GME charts, that ""heartbeat"" **clearly** is a sign that Pink Floyd liked the stock so much they were foreshadowing its existance.
    
[Full Proof Evidence](https://i.imgur.com/sS1s3Qa.png) 

Now that we know there is undeniable proof of this, lets look at some of the song names.  

1. Speak to Me / Breathe  - Primarily a safety warning, they knew dumb apes would forget to consume oxygen during the chart watching  

2.  On the **Bull** Run  - Too easy

3. Time - This shit will take time.  Dont put yourself in a position where you have to Run and Run to keep up with the Stock because you paper handed.

4. Great Gig in the Sky - Party after this is all over for apes, lots of moaning

5.  Money  -  I cant figure out the subtext for this one, its very Cryptic...

6.  Us and Them - WSB and Hedgies,  Theres a verse about lines on a map moving side to side, so it seems safe to assume that means the ticker.  Further analysis needed.

7.  Any Color You Like - An attempt to stop the divide that would occur from GME holders when arguing about best Crayon Color

8.  Brain Damage - A biographical piece about the type of people that would be needed for the ride.

9.  Eclipse - What GME is doing to all the other Stocks.  We like it.

I hope you will all see this as the absolute proof it is that GME is awesome, and we are justified in liking the stock.  If we wait long enough we will all be Comfortably Numb, so Shine on you Crazy Diamond Hands!

TLDR:  With absolute certainty, Pink Floyd predicted the GME news.

I am not a financial advisor, if you take any of this as financial advice though, I don't think much else needs to be said.","GME's rise was predicted by Pink Floyd, an extensive study",1.0,1615824163,Ichthasen

54,m5o2ge,"Sperm Banks pay between $35 - $125 per donation, the average adult male expel 3.7 milliliters of sperm per ejaculation.

 The average price per milliliter of sperm is then $9.50 milliliter or $33.80/milliliter Assuming you are young and can ejaculation twice a day, expect around 5.5 millimeters of sperm a day ( ejaculations become weaker since your balls needs charge up ) meaning anywhere from $53.90 a day to $185.90 a day. 

Let's use an modest amount of $100 a day. Assuming you can ejaculation within 10mins the first time and 15mins the second (it usually takes longer to ejaculate after already doing so) That's $100 for 25mins of work. Let's also take a cut of $5 day for gas fees and add 10mins for commute (although but obvious varies) We also cannot forget PH Premium which costs $100 yearly which brings our daily wage to be 94.7

 Suppose you repeat this everyday for 365 days , that's $94.7 x 365 = $34,565. After taxes we should expect around $25,000 to $27,000 a year. 

However, suppose you took $300 from your 9-5 job every month, along with the $2,850 from your sperm side gig and invested the total amount of $3150 every month into the S&amp;P500 at an average return if 10% per year, it would only take you 14 years to reach $1,000,000.

 Assuming you start at the age of 18. You'll reach millionaire status by 32 all while keeping a comfortable life style.
