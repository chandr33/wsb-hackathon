Nvax saves the fucking world along with multiple other companies.  Maybe usa last. Shorted to hell. Shares cheap as fuck rn. Primed for lift off. May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math


Im here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. 
Lets start with the bad. 

In 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. 

It has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. 
When the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.

Many big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. 

Honestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. 
The good.
Its absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times ""he loves burning shorts"".
Last week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. 
The market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. 
Its efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. 
Today the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.
They have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.
Institutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.

B.riley eoy price target : 398. 
I think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.
The news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too. But if any of the squeezes your in do their thang, and nvax is still down, double check to make sure nothing bad happened with the stock and then bring those tendies over for more tendies!!!",DD NVAX Next Squeeze currently at absurdly good buy point.,0.66,1614746798,Laffingglassop

I get what Palantir does in terms of a business model. I also saw a post here comparing to $CRM, and here is where i need some help.

Looking at palantir's [10-k](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdfhttp://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf), pg 111, 112

cash is 2b+, likely from the public listing, double 2019, a plus.

Revenue is 1.1b up from 742mm in 2019, and i believe guidance for 2021 was another 45% also good.

They only problem i have is stock compensation. I know the company went public and that's a large reason for the number, because if you focus on including it, they has a loss of 1.1b for the year. In of itself as a growth company i get, the only concern is the comparison to $CRM.

$CRM currently puts much of their salary expense into this category, and is maintaining the the business through acquisition. They've been hit hard in earnings as a result 260--&gt;220 and maybe lower? (keep growing revenue, but profit isn't materializing, and they are categorizing stock comp as CapEx because their employees derive compensation (in sales anyway) via stock

has anybody noticed anything similar on $PLTR?

i'm assuming if they deliver on estimates, that's $40 per share by the end of year if not 50 conservatively, but another bout of stock comp will drag the stock.

44,lwlol7,"High Times is a - beloved - American monthly magazine and cannabis brand with offices in Los Angeles and New York City. The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom For√ßade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis. The magazine has been involved in the marijuana-using counterculture since its inception.

On Jan 29th, 2020, ditched dreams of [NASDAQ Listing](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/high-times-ditches-dreams-of-nasdaq-listing/)

&gt;Hightimes Holding Corp., parent of High Times, revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the NASDAQ, a goal it had been pursuing for since mid-2017. The company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the Reg A+ process, and it reported that it would extend its Reg A+ capital raise until 4.545 million shares had been sold or until March 31st. It disclosed in an SEC filing that it recently sold 363,636 shares at $5.50 in a private placement to Ontario-based Rayray Investments (Raymond Leach, an original investor in MedReleaf), a 50% discount to where it has been selling shares.

High Times securities lawyers, Stephen Weiss and Megan Penick of L.A. based Michelman Robinson LLP, confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors.

[High Times IPO - Sorry, No Refunds - Teri Buhl of Cannabis Law Reports Talks Reg A](https://vimeo.com/438846483)

**Harvest Acquisitions**

It was in March that Harvest Health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company. Then, literally two months later, we see a letter of intent filed by Hightimes now and Harvest saying, 

&gt;""Okay well, we're actually going to buy the California assets of Have a Heart."" 

Why that was contradictory is that Harvest had just been on an investor call telling people, when an analyst asked, 

&gt;""Why are you doing this deal?"" They said, ""Well, we want a stronger footprint in California."" 

It didn't make sense that two months later they're getting rid of everything they just bought in California.

Additionally, in the last month there have been[multiple news reports](https://mjbizdaily.com/high-times-cannabis-retail-bid-complicated-by-web-of-owners-social-equity-partners/amp/) questioning if Harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to High Times.

Very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by High Times; instead it has announced millions of stock *(which isn‚Äôt publicly traded yet)* will pay for the asset purchases. With the Harvest acquisition, High Times attorney Stephen Weiss confirmed for CLR that $1.5 million was paid to Harvest but at signing only $500k was given. The asset purchase agreement filed with the SEC said High Times would pay Harvest $1 million on signing.

This is just a complete lack of transparency, and it's completely unfair for the Main Street investor trying to get into cannabis.

**Done before starting**

The Securities and Exchange Commission has told a U.S. operated cannabis media and dispensary company, High Times Holdings, that they must halt accepting investments in their mini-IPO because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report.

&gt;The last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of June.

High Times used a reporting extension the SEC created because of the Covid-19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent SEC disclosure filings, called Form 1-U, that they promised investors to get them current revenue, cash flows, debt levels and asset values by June 12, 2020 via the annual report; but CLR has learnt that this never happened.

Adam Levin‚Äôs company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $US50 million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the OTC Markets under the ticker $HITM.

On June 30th, 2020 the company made an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000149315220012247/0001493152-20-012247-index.htm) announcing once again their mini-ipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldn‚Äôt actually accept sales.

When asked if it is normal practice for a Reg A issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can‚Äôt accept sales; securities attorney Sara Hanks said:

*‚ÄùThe SEC may have softened up in the Covid crisis but previously, both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings, because there is no exemption under Reg A  for ‚Äúoffers‚Äù (advertising etc) while a company is delinquent.‚Äù*

High Times still has their investment offering page [live](https://hightimesinvestor.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=hightimesx&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLylKUJKyHSWhczvAcJAdLVBjLED6hTfWbWCb4Oejeqm5j-yCs4zpgaAgzCEALw_wcB)

Since then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases, via signed letter of intents, hyping the potential growth of High Times followed up with quiet SEC filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down. 

I have personally fallen for this sham (F), as I invested in 5000 units in 2018. They stopped responding to my inquires, in fact, there was a random charge on my credit card (from an airport in LA) the same day they charged my card for the IPO.. they stated that it would be refunded - never was. I can still log on and see the shares I have ‚Äúinvested‚Äù but they obviosuly don‚Äôt represent anything. Lesson learned..

**Recent Financials**

The company filed a[post-qualification amendment to its Form 1-A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000121390018007523/f1apos2018a1_hightimeshold.htm) with the SEC that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious. In the first quarter of 2018, sales plunged 64.9% to just $1.481 million:

Most of the decline can be attributed to the events business, which fell almost 83%, but publishing revenue declined over 16% as well. The company indicated that its Cannabis Cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year, with one in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018. The $554K in sales were generated by smaller events, and the company expects the number of Cannabis Cups and small events to increase for the full year. It blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue, with digital partially offsetting these factors.

The company provided information about its cost of revenue, which was $503K, as well as its operating expenses, which declined substantially to $2.391 million, producing an operating loss of $1.413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $6.54 million. Much of the year-ago operating expenses were due to a one-time non-cash charge of $6.689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting.

The last time the company filed official annual earnings was June 2019. High Times had told investors it would get updated financial information on June 12, but that did not happen. The company has extended the offering of shares for two years, initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the NASDAQ. Then it lowered those expectations to the Over-The-Counter Marketplace. 

**Still, it hasn‚Äôt happened.**
