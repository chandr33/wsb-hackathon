2,m1sifi,"Missed first spike in January, had 200 shares on margin at 36$. After it dipped from 400 to sub 100 I bought 100 shares at 80$ but got stopped out at 70. After the second rise and subsequent fall to 40$ I decided to hold and average down with just a few shares total of 15 shares. I held from 110 all the way down to 40 for like 3 weeks of decline. Then the overall market started to dive and the pressure on my low cap account was too much and I sold my position. I immediately rebought it - just not to see the negative balance, but said ""fuck it I missed it"". 2 days later it jumped to 90 and now its at 260. My average was 80 per share.

 I'm not going to buy again so that you may gain (because the second I decide its good to buy its gonna tank) . I'm really happy for all of you that made life-changing money. I smile every day I see the rocket roaring, because hedgies are fuk

5,m1sixx,"There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Heartz, all that shit. This is the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question, is this bull market coming to an end?

## Blow-Off Top

A ‚Äúblow-off top‚Äù is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.

&gt;*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security‚Äôs price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*  
[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

As a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.

## Why the Current Rally Might End

The S&amp;P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*

The S&amp;P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.

[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?

As stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.

When Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?

With stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.

## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue

Which of the many reasons do you want to hear first?

I‚Äôll start with the latest from President-elect Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),

&gt;\[Biden\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.

This is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.

And as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What‚Äôs in the past doesn‚Äôt matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.

The news of vaccines and thoughts of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.

Need a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&amp;P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century.

15,m1slo1,"Retards. Hello.

Like so many of us simple minded folk, I‚Äôve enjoyed AND benefited from the lack of sanity and pure retardation that this sub provides me on a daily basis. I‚Äôve admittedly become obsessed with this movement and I cannot help but to live, breathe and love every part of it. I‚Äôm not a heavy hitter by any stretch of the autistic imagination, but I‚Äôve bought and held like a true simpleton, purely to enjoy the ride and to watch Wall St. and the Hedgies squirm and squeal for their lives.

My question for you is.. I obviously see the thousands of ‚Äúhold‚Äù, ‚Äúmoon‚Äù, ‚Äúdiamond hand‚Äù posts and understand that I‚Äôm not to sell the shares I own... but should I continue to buy as we go? It appears that it‚Äôd only help the cause and I want to make sure I do what‚Äôs right by my fellow apes. I‚Äôm relatively new to the stock game and want this to succeed just as much as the rest of you. I‚Äôve got a decent amount of spare cash burning a hole in my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs pockets and I‚Äôm ready to go balls deep.

16,m1slor,"Ok, so though all this what ever I've read enough DD to fill a text book on tarot, some of it just hyping b.s. with no actual data other than ""i rubbed some sticks together to I saw smoke and the smoke means moon"". Some was actually interesting numbers. Some wrinkled my brain. (Funk, I understand options enough to explain it to others. I also understand what a gamma squeeze is too) 
Some was over hyped bad data done by other smooth brains like you and me.

What I'm reading today are a few things that I need to make sense of tho.

One bit of DD places the SI% well over 250 and as high as 950% (I don't doubt that it's still sky high)

Another is some conspiracy talking about the hedges doing a fake squeeze getting it up to 1000 then dropping it.

The third is that the real squeeze is going last hours of not days.

Now I'm a retard, I will believe anything you tell me. I would say I'm gullible but that's not even a real word cause it's not in the dictionary. So, of course I believe all of this.

So going with I believe all of this, the HFs can't actually cover their positions in one day, like they literally can not. 
The fake squeeze happens and they are able to control it with surgeon like precision to bleed people off.
Day traders and papers are going to sell.

What ever

Why not sell? Sell, let it drop, and increase your position.

Retail is like not even a quarter of the stocks available. We know this. We don't have the power to squeeze. 
But what if every one of you apes doubled, tripled, octupled your positions? What if we all scalped if we can? 
Buy back in. Increase the share that we all have, edge out the day traders, edge out the whales and hedge funds, what if a bunch of apes that drool on our phones to hit the buy button get 50-75 of the float in our hands. 
The shorts will still be there. The calls will still be there, but then we control the big chair.

Sure, we kick the squeeze down the block another month or 2.  But then it's just us retards holding when they have to call again. 
We can be porsche holding VW. 
And we can call 500k 

Iono, maybe I'm just too stupid to not understand why we shouldn't do this.

And if I am, please tell me why and I'll write a letter to your wife's boyfriend saying you deserve to sleep indoors for the week.

Fuck if I know.

92,m1t5ds,"Roblox is scheduled to go public today with a direct listing of 199 million shares. It will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol (RBLX). The exchange set a reference price of $45.

Some more information --&gt; according to: [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/roblox-rblx-initial-public-offering-ipo-wednesday](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/roblox-rblx-initial-public-offering-ipo-wednesday)

A poll of investors by research firm Bernstein finds they believe the stock could trade anywhere from $30 to $120 when it hits the open market, Bloomberg reported. So, that could mean heavy volatility.

Roblox reported that daily active users soared 82% to 31.1 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, from 17.1 million a year earlier.

Revenue jumped 68% to $588.7 million from $349.9 million. The company registered a loss of $203.2 million in the latest nine-month period, widening from $46.3 million a year earlier.

Free cash flow totaled $292.6 million in the latest period, up from $6.0 million a year ago.

Looking at buying stocks in these three companies  that I think have potential:

Pacific Biosciences of California Inc
Check cap Ltd
Asensus surgical Inc

Not looking for a quick buck, more in the market of long term swingtrading. Long term being anything from three months and on.

My German angst ass thinks that we need a much higher oilprice to give the industry the opportunity to produce CO2-friendly. There are alternatives on the market right now, but they are 2-3 times more expensive. Producing industry is trimmed to be 'efficient' , so they won't stop using oil before them alternatives are at a same or lower price level.

THE CLIMA CRISIS AIN'T CONSUMERS FAULT. IT'S THE INDUSTRY.

We could see that if we lock up humans into their homes on a globally base like we did in 2020 with less traveling etc. we were able to reduce CO-emissions by.... DRUM ROLL... 7 fckin %. This shiat ain't nothing.

Don't you wonder why Elon musk became richest man on earth? I could imagine why. No front papa Elon, I like you idealistic mivement, went in on Tesla back in 2016 when I was 21. It's clear that the big money is desperate.

We need big ideas how we can come up against clima crisis. NOW! 

otherwise the children of our children will suffer big time.
