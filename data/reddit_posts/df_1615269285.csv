So, it's one of the inevitable things I think GME will do and should do for the good of the company. There is nothing wrong with it, Elon did it twice for Tesla, Roku did it multiple times, etc. All in the billions and **the stocks would just keep rising.**

GME does have a few hundred million of debt if they can **pay them off free and use the rest of the funding to buy some companies or expand into a new line of business**. I think it would be good for the company.

46,m10j4s,"Some other loser was on here trying to pump the common (FNMA and FMCC). I just wanted to drop this in as a reality check for people before they go charging in like idiots and in all likelihood are met with disappointment. I commented this on the first post but thought it may have better reach as it's own standalone post.

The other post : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkn9vj/fnma_and_fmcc_going_to_explode_soon_compare_them/

I've been following this trade for about 4 years now. I bought in at a bad time and I'm underwater but I still believe in the underlying investment thesis and thus have not sold all the times I've been above water too.

I am going to quickly break it down for people:

INVESTMENT THESIS:

FNMA and FMCC (the companies) basically got taken over by the government, they are massively profitable but all of their money goes to Uncle Fucking Sam, like in perpetuity. This is because in 2012 Uncle Sam saw they were going to be profitable and possibly pay back the original loan they made during the '08 crisis, and they didn't like that, so they just... changed the agreement. :)

Seriously, go read the emails that were sent at this time by government officials, read about the meetings they had and the information they were provided. For me, this was clearly robbery and then they lied about it. That being said, the court cases that have been chasing this agreement for years now lost a lot, largely because of the complexity of HERA (the statute that governs the FHFA, the conservator of FNMA and FMCC) and the courts never really looking at the evidence but rather whether or not they even were allowed to. However, plaintiffs had a massive victory in the 5th Circuit Court of appeals, which was then appealed to SCOTUS. You can go listen to the SCOTUS oral argument and we are now waiting their ruling.

INVESTMENT VEHICLES:

The other post was pumping the common, this is likely a massive mistake. The jr pfds are likely much better and still have a potential 5x upside at today's prices (a month or so ago I put in another 12k). There are MANY MANY things that need to go right for the common to payout, and the commons basically have zero legal representation at the moment. Pfds have much fewer things that need to go right to get paid and have almost all the heavy hitters behind them. Ackman is the only guy holding commons I believe.

WHAT MAY HAPPEN:

Right now we are all-in on a SCOTUS ruling in our favor. 5th circuit went our way but all those gains have been sold off. If we win SCOTUS, guess what, if the government doesn't settle we could still be waiting 2-3 years for the APA claims to be judged on evidence. We have a STRONG case on that though and the government likely doesn't want egg on its face. If SCOTUS goes against us good fucking luck, we have one more case that is slated for 1.5 years from now or so and besides that we're at the mercy of the new admin and congress (e.g. we lose 50% or so from here at least).

WHERE WE HAVE BEEN:

The previous admin promised to make changes and get us out of conservatorship and basically failed to deliver entirely. The companies cap standards are pretty miserable now and Mnuchin basically kicked the can down the road (pray to Yellen if you buy in cause you're her bitch now). Court cases have been like all court cases and infinitely slow but the gears do turn.

HOW TO DO SOME DD:

Go follow holdenwalker99 and urbankaoboy on Twitter. Do not follow Glenn. That guy is a fucking moron who has some major fucking ego problems. You will come across his name often on this trade as he is a good flag bearer, but don't pay any attention to his thinking, like I said, fucking moron. The two dudes I mentioned are probably the most rational and knowledgeable (respectively) people I have come across in the years I have been following it. Glenn is more like the mascot at a sports game while the other two are the players.

Anyways, if you buy in, be prepared for the long haul. This trade is something that forever seems to be just a few weeks around the corner to a Nirvana that never comes. Many people have aptly called it the ""Waiting for Godot"" trade for that reason.

Anyways, good luck!

TL/DR - If you choose to go in buy jr pfds, avoid the ones that have zero % interest rates right now, and good fucking luck to us all.

I was miserable, unhappy and was dreading going into work. You know it‚Äôs bad when you take 30 minutes to make a cup of coffee during work hours. One day I browsed WSB on my phone and I was like this should keep my mind sane. One thing lead to another, I downloaded RH and dumped some cash and doubled my money. I was hooked. Eventually, I learned that investing isn‚Äôt all sunshine and I did have lots of  bad days. I felt like quitting at one point because I was unsure how to  financially recover. I learned to hold and average down and everything went back to normal. Market goes up and down. Now to my point, my depression has gotten under control. I can sleep at night thinking about waking up the next morning. I feel less miserable at work and learned not to take my job so seriously. WSB has definitely keep my mind leveled and helped me decompress my problems.",You guys saved my life. I have a purpose to get up everyday.,1.0,1615272181,Zoey1234100
