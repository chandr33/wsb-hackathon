50,mh6rkc,"TLDR; $SEAS is not worth $50 right now. I bought puts and I’m considering going short for the first time ever. FREE WILLY.

QUICK SUMMARY ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY: If you're thinking you've seen this before, it's because my post got deleted yesterday because a couple things I said were not approved by the mods. Mods said I could repost it now, so I decided to go a little more in-depth into everything SEAS related. I even put some quick headers for those of you wanting to skim through. I’ll be answering lots of questions in the comments. Also, thanks to u/Neighbor_ for the inspiration on this play.

SEAWORLD HISTORY:
SeaWorld is a well known aquatic theme park company. Everyone knows these dirtbags as the guys who abuse whales, if you are somehow too young or you live under a rock go watch the movie Blackfish. It was a documentary exposing the life of one of the captive whales and it's pretty fucking disturbing. After a while their fins don't even stand straight up anymore from stress/mistreatment. PETA (ok fuck PETA though) has been on these guys asses for years and rightfully so. They’ve improved somewhat over the years but their reputation has been permanently damaged.

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020:
The documentary and story caused a slight dip in the stock AND specifically in attendance, but both eventually recovered, and SEAS was hitting ATHs of $35 a share in the beginning of 2020. Suddenly COVID appears out of nowhere and many start to fear companies like SEAS would take major losses and have to add on even more debt. A now-retired and legendary WSB member known as u/fuzzyblankeet notices and creates an epic analysis of SeaWorld’s debt far too complicated for the average ape on this sub today. Check his profile if you want to read it or reread it.  He wound up getting rich off SEAS death puts that he bought before it tanked due to COVID. He’s probably somewhere far away on an island now loading up on more $SEAS puts tbh. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021:
SEAS struggled to crack $30 for the rest of 2020, but in 2021, it went from a low of $30 on February 1st to current all-time highs of $50. In my last post, I kind of breezed over how the stock even got to 50 in the first place. It seems in February there was a rotation by (mostly) institutions from growth stocks (think AAPL, TSLA for now) into more value heavy stocks (think VIAC, BA, air/cruise lines). I believe these institutions were betting big on recovery plays such as SEAS, and in the process these stocks have become significantly overbought, smashing pre-covid levels easily. This is backed by an unusually high % of the stock owned by institutions. 

Keep in mind this company is still losing a shit ton from being mostly closed, about 25 million per quarter. SEAS also had to add another 225 million in debt to keep from going under, bringing debt to 2.2 billion. How SEAS is sitting at 40% above precovid levels while adding lots of debt and burning money out the ass is beyond me. I don’t really think they are going under but it’s certainly a possibility in the next few years. 

WHY I MIGHT GO SHORT:
This brings me to my next point of why shorting could be a better option than puts. My prediction is that institutions will inevitably rotate out of a shitty stock like SEAS and back into growth when they realize how overbought some of these recovery/value names are. Predicting when this will happen could be a challenge. We saw it a little bit in what happened with VIAC/DISCA but I don’t think it will be to such a major degree this time or happen as quickly. I think SEAS could climb up to 52 a share this week and that would be a good spot to go short for me. 

My final point is to take a look at a stock that is eerily similar, Six Flags. Both companies are theme parks that were doing about 1.4 billion in revenue in the years before the pandemic, and six flags was experiencing better growth than SEAS. Cash flow numbers and amount of money burned from pandemic were similar as well, but Six Flags is sitting at 47$ compared to ATHs of 70 a share. 

THE LONGER TLDR:
You probably just ignored that entire post but I’ll sum it up again for those who can’t read. SeaWorld is a notoriously immoral company that abuses whales and is sitting 40% above pre-covid levels despite being mostly closed the entire time. They’ve done nothing but add on debt and hurt growth prospects, and who knows if they can even return to precovid levels in terms of revenue and attendance. As for now, they are not projecting 1.4 billion in revenue until 2022. Regardless, I feel morally obligated to go short and FREE THE WHALE🐳🐳 I will be answering as many questions as possible in the comments.

58,mh6u1v,"Hello banana people.  I’m fairly new to WSB and this is my first post here.  I’ve been trading for a few years now and am delighted to have found this community and thoroughly enjoy the discussions here.  I am far from an expert and welcome any and all feedback / criticism on my post.

Weed stocks have been my biggest plays so far.  I was fortunate enough to have APHA in my portfolio at a 4.75 cost basis when it shot up early this year.  I wanted to share my belief on another potential big time play in weed stocks.

First off, I am one who is very bullish on the weed market in general.  I believe that is the largest untapped market today and things are just getting started.

Now into the specific topic for this post:  Greenlane Holdings (GNLN) and KushCo Holdings (KSHB).  These equities trade on the OTC market.

Just this morning the two companies announced a merger.  I expect that we will continue to see many more mergers in the sector as companies compete for top dogs in the weed market.  

Greenlane and KuschCo both supply packings, papers, THC cartridges, ect. - basically all the little trinkets you’ll find at a smoke shop.  This means they’re not competing with the growers but still have huge growth potential as the weed market expands.

Unlike APHA / TLRY, the companies are headquartered in the U.S. and have much lower market caps.  This gives them more growth potential than the large cap Canadian cannabis companies.  While APHA / TLRY is playing to expand from the more established market of Canada into the more untapped market in the U.S., GNLN / KSHB is an under the radar supplier that is looking to establish a large market presence on its own turf.  But again, GNLN / KSHB is not so much competing with the growers like APHA /TLRY and SNDL.

The merger is beneficial for the companies not just because they supply similar products and synergy and yadda yadda, but they also have their own unique supply chains that they can now double dip in.  KSHB operates more as a smoke shop supplier while GNLN has a strong foothold in the e-commerce market.  Working together now, they can potentially capitalize as a supplier to both shops and online customers.

With the merger, KSHB will be converted into 0.2546 shares of GNLN.  This ratio is helpful when trying to get the best cost basis.

TL;DR:  news of GNLN &amp; KSHB merger could be a nice catalyst for the stocks (similar to news of APHA &amp; TLRY merger).  The companies are also well positioned for huge potential growth over the next few years as the weed market expands.",GNLN &amp; KSHB - Weed play not named APHA / TLRY or SNDL,1.0,1617199536,squeaknastyy
