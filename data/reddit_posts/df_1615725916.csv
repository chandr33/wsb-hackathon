Once you've cashed out with many tendies, let us remember that these Hedge Funds don't make anything and don't create value. I ask you to consider that, whilst the money is great, we didn't earn it, and neither did the HFs.

**Our parents did, the friends and relatives who worked hard, did. Please prove to the world that the money in our apish hands is better spent than in the pockets of Hedgie's.** 

With our tendies, we create value and give back rather than flaunt, hoard and destroy people's lives.

Wait, what? Shutup you ninny.    Sorry I talk to myself at times.  F their risk, how is it that the financial professionals are always completely incompetent with risk management and get screwed on a regular basis til the SEC, etc., bails them out.

Well gee, I thought I had a good idea - I noticed i could get about the same money on 6-mont $800 GME call sales ($94.00 iirc, still as close as a month but that's playing with fire with naked options.)

Oh, and I've had and have had naked permissions, I rarely use them, more to leg out of a trade if anything, but with 6 months for GME to correct that seems like a no-brainer sell, and if it  stays at  2000  for a year, rip my yolo.       Well, apparently TD/Think or Swim isn't allowing naked options permissions, and wouldn't even let me sell a covered call as I hadn't talked to one of their ""experts"" about the trade.   It's funny cuz, I can buy 200,000 TSLA $5k calls for whatever small amount that'd be, and TD would be just fine with that.    This anti-risk narrative is sickening.  I also can't sell spreads? DEFINED risk trades?  


Am I the only one who feels like its all our war on retail traders? To be fair, plenty are dumb FOMO buyers but they'll be gone soon and those that have been around know the deal.  We've long dealt with all the bullshit that funds and institutions force upon us.  I have a high 7-figure BoA account but they insist on charging me 27% APR on my card.

I sure as hell dont want to call them, wait  20 min while it moves  30% etc., just to put in an order - and THEY KNOW THIS OF COURSE.    They've found the magic cure for their retail trader woes - when they're front running you regardless of your brokerage and  able to  scalp your trade, they make money off that as well as plenty, I'm sure, when  it drops from 500 to 200, etc..

57,m4v2jm,"**Hello my dear Apes,**

Last night, I had a dream about¬†**reaching the moon**. Of course, this is not investment advice. Hear my dream out.

1. Mission

It started with a mission. We know APES like the stock, but at the end, they are here to put down to the greedy hedgies and get rich. This is the biggest poker game ever played on the planet. The winner is for sure the one that knows the hand of the other. So your mission APES, if you accept it, is to make the enemy shows their hands. Exciting dream, no? Starting like Mission impossible

2. Force surrender

Su Tzu teaches many things but not the most important. The best attack is the one that even if your enemy knows about it, he has no alternative to surrender. The character in my dream was of course Yoda! He said: ""Let‚Äôs make then surrender!""

3. The plan

The hedges are playing because nobody has a way to know what the Apes own versus the float. Let‚Äôs make it know by a simple way. The oracle told me: All APES will place a sell order at a moon price to discover how much they own together. The oracle knows is much more than the shares outstanding (69.75M). At this moment in my dream, I though if it is the case, they are so F‚Ä¶

4. The price

The current price is $267 USD at 18.45B market cap.

Morpheus then told me the plan. All APES did woke up on Monday and coincidentally place sell orders at $7,184. They have super power. Why this price I thought? Then Morpheus told me he did not know if it was the algo machine who decided but likely because it is 500B market cap and will be a¬†26x times¬†from where we are, which APES will agree could be the best pay day ever and a 480B lost for the hedgies. Morpheus then concluded ""Don‚Äôt worry they can find the money.""

Doing so, APES discovered the size of the APES' position. Don‚Äôt be surprise, in my dream it tooks a few days before everybody catch up on the trend, and APES expected 5-10 days to know the real position.

5. The attack

APES are slow, so they kept this price for the first 5 days, then they thought that they wanted more bananas and increased the price by 500$ per day. After 10 days, they increased by $1000 per day. By March 31st, they reached $12,684 and 884B market cap. They even thought going to the trillion pushed by the WBS community ;). But Elon was crying in the dream because it eclipsed his babies! Sorry Elon, I cannot control my dreams.

Are this dream completely crazy ? No, at the end, hedges had to balance the cost of surrender. The APES army was there and not ready to surrender. Was 500b better than 1T? For sure baby, game theory baby. They tried to call the FED to rescue but the FED was busy with interest rates.

At this time, I almost wake up but the oracle told to listen carefully.

6. The flaws

They had a few. And the oracle described them.

\- The main one was that the APES might had paper hands and a little portion of the float. If at the moment of the dream, I had to choose the right pill. Were they a bunch of complete retards dreamers with no game? Red or Blue?

\- Also, in parallel universe, Apes might have sold when they don‚Äôt see a large part of the float own by the APAES. They see no bananas and panic. Hopefully they were not as retarded as we say.

\- The hedges tried to play to create noise on the sell orders and add to it. Desperate moves of any losers in movies.

\- Apes could also play greedy and distort the game by placing sell order without owning the share. But YODA told them to NEVER do this.

\- In the dark part of the dream, GME could have still issue stock to save them all. I woke up for a minute and then thought impossible because they can shut down their business right away because I imagine all of us will be pissed off. I went back to sleep and resume the dream.

7. The counter move

At the beginning of the dream, nobody did believe it possible and hedges thought they have a way out. But APES discovered that they had the float or more than the actual float (impossible theoretically), APES were good and told the hedgies they would keep buying until the system collapse.

The hedges, in a desperate attempt, tried to place a master sell order at our target price to make the number so big that we don‚Äôt know what the apes have. At this point my dream went crazy and Neo should a secret counter move to this, I don't feel sharing it yet. I am still shaken by the dream. Let's wait next Thursday. We need to keep some suspens.

8. END GAME

Happy ending of course. No s... but so many retards getting rich. The hedgies had only this opportunity to buy it back the entire float and finish the story. They bought everybody at $7,184 on March 19.

Morpheus told me it was the story of the red pill. We would have choose the blue one, APES would have waited until their compounds interest on shorts kill the hedgies at slow death and he thought there is an alternative universe where the government rigs the game as they often do.

**Love this game, Pay day is coming APES and Check Mate Hedges.**

What a dream, no? It is of course a fantasy of two nights ago. I wanted to share with the community and this is not financial advise and any recommendations of any kind. Just a stupid dream. Proud GME shares owner.","GME, Master Plan for the END GAME. I had a dream!",1.0,1615728724,chrissingap
58,m4v2mw,"Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; ‚ÄúThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,‚Äù said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. ‚ÄúI think the message is going to be consistent.‚Äù
*****
&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% ‚Äî its highest level in more than a year.
*****
&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year ‚Äî deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,‚Äù said Peters of PGIM.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there‚Äôs going to be pressure on rates moving higher.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals
&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhen rates are very low, valuations don‚Äôt matter to people,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf rates are low, there‚Äôs no penalty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen here.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he‚Äôs found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe names that I‚Äôm in ‚Äî Visa, GM, Ford, Macy‚Äôs, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,‚Äù Redler said. ‚ÄúLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‚ÄòWas that it?‚Äô‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday‚Äôs lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Apple‚Äôs stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market‚Äôs gains last year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWatch Apple because it‚Äôs a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,‚Äù Redler said.
*****
&gt; # Bond volatility
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February‚Äôs retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank‚Äôs leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
&gt; The program expires March 31.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,‚Äù Peters of PGIM said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe markets are kind of divided on what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see these whippy moves.‚Äù

&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

&gt; March‚Äôs option expiration week performance is second only to December‚Äôs and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ‚Äôs track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March‚Äôs quarterly options expiration.

&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?

&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While we don‚Äôt think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. ‚ÄúWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.‚Äù

&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

&gt; We‚Äôve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market‚Äôs technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior ‚Äì and likely to do so for some time to come.

&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today‚Äôs stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week‚Äôs technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

&gt; # Versatile Outperformers

&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

# You may have come across Billy the Ape earlier with his post regarding prolonging the endgame orgasm?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1l2ac/dd\_how\_to\_best\_prolong\_the\_endgame\_orgasm\_hint\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1l2ac/dd_how_to_best_prolong_the_endgame_orgasm_hint_we/)

*Let Billy start by saying, this post is his own DD, and is \*NOT\* advice, you other apes can take or leave what you like from it. He provides it only so that smarter apes can weigh in and confirm what he thinks he already knows.*

&amp;#x200B;

*TL;DR - Numbers are ""unique"" (fucky) compared to other stocks. This will boom regardless of shorts, MOASS, etc etc. Billy wants to BUY &amp; HODL üíéüôå* 

&amp;#x200B;

So.. Billy has been looking at Fintel (paid service.. relatively up to date, super in depth), and also other websites, and he also witnessed one of the most blatant media manipulations he's ever seen recently.

So he did what any reasonable ape would do and raised the price on \*HIS\* personal strategy to get to the moon, andromeda.. or somewhere further out. Check Billys edits on the old post.

*Processing img 9ai19vxgyzm61...*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# So the weekend presents a time for us apes, to go do stuff, Billy did! He hung out with family, and now the weekend is almost over, he decided to dive into numbers, breakdowns, and see (with the limited information, and brainpower he has) what he could discover and throw at you apes in simple smooth brained chunks!

&amp;#x200B;

First.

The breakdown, below is interesting to Billy since he isn't a stonk guru - but still thinks it's incredibly odd that the amount of \*REAL\* üçåüçåüçå's pale in comparison to the amount that seem to ""exist"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Interesting story - GME breakdown:

# ~ 15mil held in ETFs

# ~ 16mil held in Mutual Funds

# ~ 110mil held by Institutional Investors

\~ 17mil Insider Shares (GME Employees)

# Retail Ownership .... ???

# 

&amp;#x200B;

So.. All up we have a grand stonk total of ...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wait for it...

# üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçåüçåüçåüçåüçå 158 MILLION SHARES OF GME üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçå üçåüçåüçå

&amp;#x200B;

# Out of a total of a 54mil float, that means there is a ball park figure of ~ 104mil out there in the hands of everyone but us apes! üçå

&amp;#x200B;

# And however many üçå the retail apes own.. We ACTUALLY own.. unlike some of the other fucky stuff going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Let that sink in for a minute. Billy will wait.

&amp;#x200B;

[ So.. when Apes HODL üíéüôå how does this work? Billy can't work it out.. All he knows is his stonks are worth a LOT.. ](https://preview.redd.it/db3mfvzqyzm61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eecbc720bef1104bda6ba2ca9c3f0f56d90e7301)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*As Billy mentioned, that's quite a LOT of outstanding shares... He's looked at other stonks to confirm this is a lot. See Billys Fintel dumps below:*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# As you can see.. Institutional Investors on 158% of the stonk.

WUUUUUUUUT??? Confused ü¶ç

&amp;#x200B;

[This is a real synthetic stock. Very unlike what these HF's seem to be holding in GME.. lol.](https://preview.redd.it/7353y60zyzm61.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59c562c3798858b275fe2b737a6a3cb5127c3f81)

&amp;#x200B;

# Anywho.. Billy thinks there's even more interesting stuff. Go check out [https://www.wallstreetzen.com/](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/) - In the Ownership section it shows a nice little ownership breakdown bar. Coloured, with percentages, and also amounts. Billy will chew crayons while you confirm this.Surprisingly enough... the entire 100% is taken up by Institutions and Insider shares.. Retail Apes don't even get a mention.

&amp;#x200B;

[Queue spoopy X-Files music!](https://preview.redd.it/w9zvyfz0zzm61.jpg?width=987&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a555b2c0724d25924ad482f3635ea97b4aa89a76)

# 

# So Billy, in your humble opinion, what exactly does this mean???

&amp;#x200B;

[Nothing new. Billy still thinks BUY &amp; HOLD. He likes the stock.](https://preview.redd.it/3xys9u13zzm61.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354803b3c317a6fb79f96cda7d39db58aef8d1bb)

&amp;#x200B;

# To Billy, it would mean in his smooth brain, that eventually... things will level out, the synthetic BS will have to be paid for, and at some point the apes will üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to another galaxy.

# You Apes own your shares. The other guys don't.

# Regardless of SI, SI%, the squeeze, timeframes - ANY - of it... Eventually GME will need to = 100% again instead of this fuckery. So in the meantime if your ape brain, and funds allow it, BUY &amp; HOLD üíéüôå

&amp;#x200B;

Billy has included a snappy Imagur Link to the screenshots from [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/)

These were pulled tonight (14/03/2021) - and yes, some stuff is out of date, but Billy is giving the most recent data he has, so that hopefully more big brain apes can pull this apart.

If anyone requires more from Fintel just drop Billy a DM.

See here: [https://imgur.com/a/8GRREZb](https://imgur.com/a/8GRREZb)

&amp;#x200B;

# Now for the end fluff.

Billy has ape friends he told the tales of GME to, and they have heard him and made their own decisions to buy the stock.

Billy thinks the limit is what YOU personally set it to.

Billy thinks that with the way they are scraping Reddit for what us apes value $GME at is lame. He also thinks that with tax etc. to pay, you're short selling yourself @ 1million / üçå

Billy wants his new floor price to be 5 million / üçå - They wanna talk bell curves, and price expectations. Get it in your monkey brains. 5 MILLION A üçå! (That way even the üìÑüôå apes among this place may still become millionaires!)

Billy can't wait for Monday.. and each Monday after this one, regardless of if a gamma squeeze, MOASS, or any other fortunate thing happens.

Billy doesn't believe in time frames.

Billy is still totally getting a üíé tattoo @ 1mil a üçå

87,m4v9bs,"A few months ago, I was in a state of abject despair. I had been through two horrible/extremely heartbreaking relationships back to back, lost my job due to COVID-19(was living on unemployment and savings), I had developed a neck beard nest, etc. I had no interest in anything but smoking weed, jacking off, and sleeping.

Then, in December, I started following the GME stuff(didn‚Äôt have much to invest myself sadly), which lead to a deeper interest in the stock market, etc. I would wake up every day pre market(I had no sleep schedule before so this was big for me) and just sit there and watch various stocks and read discussion. It got addictive and I would be reading for 8 hour long sessions at times. I got more and more into it, to the point where I was reading books about the market(I hadn‚Äôt read a book in two years before) and just generally having not depressing thoughts all the time. I got a job in January, but continued basically spending all my free time either stressing about bullshit or reading about the market/looking at charts. At this point, I had begun investing a little money which made it even more interesting. Eventually, around beginning February, I was started to feel back to my normal self somewhat. Still scarred, like not at all ready for love again and scared I will slip back into depression(still have some really low days), but also my interests were coming back, I was having energy again, I was wanting to see/make friends again. 

Now, in March, shit is pretty much back to normal. I now am maybe not as obsessed with the market(some of my other hobbies started to come back like philosophy, tv and movies...I seriously went 6 months without viewing a movie or tv show because I was that depressed lol) but still looking at it every day and actually working on my own SQL project for stock screening. But just wanted to thank this community for proving a catalyst to get me back to normal.
