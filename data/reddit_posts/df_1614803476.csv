55,lx3sbz,"So, i want to talk about Big Tech's unloved little brother (other than Facebook (aha!)), and that's obviously Salesforce.

Let's talk fundamentals, because fundamentals are what we should speak about and I am more of a fundamental player than a technical one. And fundamentally, Marc Benioff has kept to and maintained his 20% YoY revenue growth. The last three quarters, especially, have been gigantic in terms of earnings, as Salesforce has significantly beat Earnings due to the pandemic boost.

Furthermore, margin expansion also beat expectations. Furthermore, what that means is that when revenue growth inevitably dips below twenty percent sometime in the next few years, margin growth should keep earnings growth above 20 percent well in the future. Margin expansion should be helped by WFH after the pandemic, as Salesforce reduces workspace to accommodate (something it has mentioned it will be doing).

The acquisitions that Salesforce has made, while perhaps too generous, ensure that there is retention of top executives because they buy in. It also allows for upselling, and that's huge for us because like, like Microsoft, it can keep you within its ecosystem. As customer retention is above -90  percent-, this allows for sticky customers... And this will likely continue to grind higher.

Furthermore, Salesforce dominates the SFA space but only has 30 percent of the market in a highly fragmented and still growing space.

Salesforce's projected acquisition of Slack was a very large drag, and the general selloff of the tech sector has provided a huge downward push unto Salesforce. I think that critics have been proven wrong about Benioff's prior acquisitions, and that acquiring companies always suffer a short term drag to their stock before gaining upward momentum because of it. Slack's earnings are tomorrow, and should definitely beat last quarter's EPS which was positive. I expect that Slack will have an amazing quarter, much as other WFH companies have had, and that will prove to be a positive catalyst on Salesforce Stock.

Analysts have a consensus price target of 270.75. Morningstar has one at 265. The price right now is a touch under 206. That's huge upside, and a positive catalyst could cause an upward explosion in the stock. It doesn't even have to be micro, but macro, with passage of the stimulus bill which congress says it will pass mid march. Heck, even a  more micro focused easing of tension regarding interest rates would cause a significant upward momentum. Salesforce is oversold.

I bought 3 March 19 calls to allow them to print, and I also have 14 shares.
