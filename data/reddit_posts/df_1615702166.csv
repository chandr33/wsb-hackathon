10,m4pisy,"In order to truly outperform the average market’s measly 10-12% per year, one needs to think outside the box and invest in areas most people aren’t looking. We’ve seen this numerous times recently with investments such as GameStop, AMC, meme-based cryptocurrenies, the list goes on and on. Places that the big money and boomers haven’t latched on to yet.

Sears Corporation is down well over 99% from it’s all time high of ~144 to a measly 0.36, boasting a measly market cap of 38 million dollars. 

This came after they filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and began to close a number of stores. They will remain in Chapter 11 bankruptcy for only 1 more year. They currently own 72 stores. For comparison, JC penny, now a privately traded company owns 1100 stores and has an estimated valuation of 6.6 billion dollars, at 6 million per store. Sears stores are enormous, and with this valuation each store is less than one million dollars. The real estate alone attracts me.

I highly doubt such a famous company that had revenue of over 53 billion dollars in 2006 and over 16 billion in 2018 will leave their shareholders with nothing in return. 

This is not financial advice, but personally I am planning to take out a decent position in this on Monday and think it has some real potential. I would love to get any second opinions and see if anyone can find some interesting insights. SHLDQ to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀",Sears Holding Corporation (SHLDQ).

39,m4po23," Some people believe that the History that defines the world is that made by those in the books. For those who screamed loudest, for those who won. Those that history chooses to remember are those that make history. That is what they have made us believe, that is what they want us to believe. The reality is different and in these months I have seen it with my own eyes. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Years ago I was told that the age of heroes was over. That those who had changed the course of history were not necessary. That it was an era if they, without hope and without possibilities. Those words stuck into me like daggers in my back, unable to remove them being a reminder of the pain that this world brings. 

&amp;#x200B;

 And this is true, the era of heroes is over. A new era has begun, an era that has roared with all its brilliance these last few days. It is clear that the world is burning and those at the bottom do not care. It is clear that they do not care how many people they take ahead in order to get one more penny. He does not care about our future, an age of darkness seems to be looming where the value of souls can be achieved with pieces of paper. 

&amp;#x200B;

 But I have witnessed how there are also those who rise up against the darkness. Those willing to smile at the abyss and face it. They are not heroes, they are ordinary people. Every time I turn I see more people facing the approaching tsunami. I am happy to have witnessed the era of the death of heroes, I am happy that not there any more. For a new era is closing in on humanity. The age of the people, the age of the people. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Those who make history are ordinary people who, in the face of the imminent waves, remain. They are those who, despite the fact that the situation turns against them, remains firm against an endless onslaught. Those who without asking for anything do something with a smile on their face. History was never made by those we put on pedestals. Those who make history are the people. Because as long as the human will exists, there will be the will to do what is right. 

&amp;#x200B;

 The people in this forum have made history, they may never be mentioned, or remembered. Statues are probably not built or roads named, but don't forget that they have made history. They have restored hope to many people, they have faced what was thought impossible and have managed to change the course of history itself. Perhaps his actions will never be mentioned but his footprint has been marked in history itself. Those who resented, those who helped, and those who saw it. Today they can proudly say that they have made history, and that is something that no one can take away from them. That despite the blows they received, they stood upright before tyrants, they can see the sky and feel proud that they have done something to make a better tomorrow. You have made history.

56,m4ps52,"&gt;Come around you retarded apes and a story I will tell  
&gt;  
&gt;About the greatest autist, you all should know him well  
&gt;  
&gt;His name was Keith P. Gill and he held gamestock all his life  
&gt;  
&gt;He's had made twenty-seven million, yet he never stopped lovin’ his wife   
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;*Wherever you are holdin’ now*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Nobody knows*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, he said “I am not a cat” to The House and in his reddit posts  
&gt;  
&gt;Wherever there was short interest, there was Kitty and his calls  
&gt;  
&gt;He had the reputation as the autisticist man around  
&gt;  
&gt;Wives would keep their boyfriends home when Kitty came to town  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*And it's buy, Kitty, buy*

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Surfin’ down the Dippissippi to the sound of paper hands selling in despair   
&gt;  
&gt;They're still talkin' about his double down on that fifty-thousand shares  
&gt;  
&gt;""I've come to say I like the stock, "" Roarin’ Kitty says

&gt;Up goes the rocket ship to the sound of Melvin’s weep  
&gt;  
&gt;There was an all-out gamma squeeze, lasted longer than a week  
&gt;  
&gt;Nine million apes had laid their money down  
&gt;  
&gt;When Kitty finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town

&gt;*Wherever you are holdin’ now*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Nobody knows*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But Kitty had a heart of gold and this I know is true  
&gt;  
&gt;He supported all his children and all their mother too  
&gt;  
&gt;He wore no rings or fancy things like other retards wore  
&gt;  
&gt;He spread his tendies far and wide to help the sick and the poor  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*And it's buy, Kitty, buy*

&gt;*Nobody knows*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When you held your calls with Kitty, you never really knew  
&gt;  
&gt;Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true  
&gt;  
&gt;He won a headband as the hedgies folded in their chair  
&gt;  
&gt;The hedgies, they left a diamond oversold, Kitty didn't even have a care  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*And it's buy, Kitty, buy*

&gt;*Hold, Kitty, hold*

&gt;  
&gt;It was late one evenin' when the greedy lawyers came  
&gt;  
&gt;A retard lost all his money, he said, ""Kitty was to blame""  
&gt;  
&gt;He sued poor Kitty, though the case was dead, it was a tragic fate  
&gt;  
&gt;When Kitty's calls expired in the money, it was checkmate  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*And it's buy, Kitty, buy*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Hold, Kitty, hold*

&gt;So all you retarded apes, wherever you might be  
&gt;

&gt;Make your money while you can, before you have to stop  
&gt;  
&gt;For when you pull that diamond hand, your holdin’ days are up
