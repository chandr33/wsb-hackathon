36,m1xj6s,"After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my children, then watching the 1971 movie, the GME events were predicted 40+ years ago.  I included pictures to help guide you along.  I hope this is helpful for you apes.

Here is my analysis:

* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor 🦍.  
* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing ""Not-a-Cat"" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors 🦍 of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) 🍬, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. 🎫
* Large corporations 🏢 buy large amounts of candy (stock) 🍬 because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) 🏰  is going to fail. 
* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets 🎫 in the candy 🍬 they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.
* With candy supplies 🍬 being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs 🚀.  Not liking this, the corporations 🏢 restrict limits on the amount of candy 🍬 which can be purchased.
* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket 🎫 has been found.  This sends the price of candy 🍬 crashing.
* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. 🎫  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy 🍬 increases. 🚀  All this time, Charlie had 💎👐.

***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** 🏰 

* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.🍫  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. 
* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry 🔵, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.
* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels 🐿 opening the nuts 🌰, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut 🌰 opening squirrel 🐿 instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel 🐿, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut 🌰 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel 🐿.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.
* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room 📺, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High 📈, Sell Low 📉.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.

***Other Characters***

* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda 🍾.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda 🍾.  The soda 🍾 causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.
* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper 🍭.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?

***That Scary River Scene*** 👹

* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??

***Conclusion***

* In the end, Charlie held 💎👐 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon 🌚🌚🌚.



***TL:DR;***  Charlie 💎👐 crashed through the roof, 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon 🌚🌚🌚.  The others paper handed, tried to distract Charlie, and got roasted.

38,m1xjb7,"Apparently the degenerate version of Minecraft is being released. After carefully studying this company for about 15 minutes I have come to the following conclusions:

Only the dumbest children plays this however, this is amazing because of how their monetization works. You see if you’re stupid enough to play this game, then you’re probably dumb enough to spend money also. 

Another thing. Apparently this game has a massive grooming and pedophilia problem because again, since only the dumbest of kids play this, it’s no wonder they get in the van when they offer candy. This might be an issue down the line as it may require government interference in certain countries. Australia is notorious for fining and going after game companies that allow child abuse. All kidding aside, not cool, stay safe kids.

Back to something more serious. Monetizing. Kids that are autists or degenerates in the making (Future WSB users) are extremely likely to spend money on games. Especially when that money is their parents money. These people have no concept of value. To put this in perspective. The company is expected to make 250mill a year. Imagine if they bought gme with that money instead of “Robux”

They wanna launch at a price of $45 today however I find this might be low considering how much money the company makes. But also their future projects are actually not bad. They intend to support Roblox for as long as it is solvent, but they have some basic roadmap for future games including a possible Roblox 2 if the demand is there. This is good enough for me so I hope it’s good enough for you. Plus who wouldn’t wanna buy Roblox stoxk. I can’t think of a greater waste of my irl Robux.",So apparently Roblox goes Public today.

If anyone could help clarify the situation I am in that would be extremely beneficial.

I live in the Netherlands as an EU student. I invested most of my bank account into gme (&lt;10k euros). If I walk out of here with a really good amount of money given what the sentiment seems to be, what kind of tax am I looking at?

I saw income tax per investment is dependent on capital.

So assuming I walk out of here with a gross sum of 100k+ for example, it would be a flat 30% tax on a percentage of my profits? From what I understood they tax an assumed percentage of your capital (2-5%) assuming it is profits and apply the flat rate of 30%.

44,m1xjxm," 

First let me say we are in an excellent position we were before the 2/26 earnings call. The stock is trading at 26! I didn't expect to see this price to soon. Yes, I know we had fall from $41 (RKT even hit $46) and that could be discourage to some, since you ""lost"" 36%. Probably the surge to $41 was massive call options, some shorts covering, but the surge to $26 was due to the excellent results RKT showed in their earnings call.

Here I'm going to make a comparison between LDI and UWMC results with RKT. Let me start with an extract of their earnings calls:

""... **our incremental gain in 2020 alone, was nearly large enough to eclipse the entire all-in closed loan volume of the nation's second largest originator last year""**

UWMC close volume for 2020 was 182 billion (76% was due to refinance) an increase of 69% with respect to 2019. LDI was 100 billion (they don't disclose refinance vs purchase) an increase of 122%. RKT close volume was 320 billion, an increase of 175 billion (or 121%). RKT gains were 2.3 times UWMC gains or 3.1 LDI gains.

Margins: Rkt margins were 4.46% (4.41% Q4 2020), LDI were 4.27% (3.38% Q4 2020), UWMC were 3.05% in Q4 2020 (I couldn't find the metric for the full year)

**Rocket Auto ... results orchestrating more than $750 million in gross merchandise value of automotive e-commerce transactions**

I notice kind of a shift in this market call, they put Rocket Auto in front and Jay was excited of the possibilities of this business with Rocket Mortgage. Rocket has two agreements with Vroom 1) They are going to list used cars in the Rocket Auto platform in exchange of VRM [**stocks**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580864/000156459021010584/vrm-10k_20201231.htm) 2) They provide selling and customer servicing to Vroom, in other words, Rocket offers support and sales to Vrom, you should read the agreement [**here**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1580864/000119312520157158/d801274dex1011.htm)**.** The agreement is very interesting because Rkt has to literally collect all the documents needed and assist them in the transactions. So if anyone can call Vrom and ask how they do this process, are they fast? they had to fill the information twice? one in Vrom CRM and the other in Rkt platform?.. (I can't call myself because I'm not American, so the I call will cost me like 10 RKT shares)

The agreement started on April 2020. VRM [**sold**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580864/000156459021010584/vrm-10k_20201231.htm) 62,981 autos for 1,072 millions in 2020. The e-comerce segment of VRM sold 34,488 units and as stated in the call ""**This equates to just over 32,000 auto units in 2020""** This means (for me at least) Rocket Auto revenue comes entirely of Vrom ecommerce segment.

Edit:

Look at this beautiful peace in Vrom earnings call ""**we've also partnered with business process outsourcers to help us scale and manage our ever-increasing volumes. We believe that we will be substantially ahead of the customer service curve by the beginning of the second half** "" They are talking about RKT!","Comparison of RKT, UWMC and LDI (which of them looking best)",1.0,1615383219,SagaDoto

Now, what am I trying to say with this?   


It's so fucking easy to make a statement on an anonymous forum. You don't have to back it up, you don't have to provide credibility. And as always on the internet, everyone is a fucking expert.

If you look at the timestamp of the first screenshot, you see how opinions change during bearish movements. If you look at the second screenshot, you see how it changes during bullish behaviour. 

When the stock hits 500, 600, 700, 1k, 2k, 5k, 10k, 25k, 50k, 100k and so on, this type of individual will scream from the top of their lungs that ""THIS IS THE TOP"". 

Listen to your gut, your own instinct. Read up on the DD that has already been done, verify it, think about it and also take the time to do your own. 

Because there will always be ""experts"" trying to tell you what to do, and 95% of them will be wrong.

85,m1xpch,"Tldr; Norwegian oil-service company, oil prices rising, they just got a big contract from Equinor, its going to the moon.

PGS is a Norwegian oil-service company, using 4D-Seismic technology (No fucking clue what this means) to find oil and gass, mainly for the Norwegian Oil company Equinor. It is sold on the Norwegian stock exchange, so if you are not willing or able to trade on Norwegian stock exchange!      2 bad for you! Its free money! 

As some of you might know we fucking love oil in Norway, but it has been taking a beating the last years, as Eco-socialists try to save the planet or whatever. 

But it is time for a comeback!

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img wccpdau997m61...*

The share price fell from around NOK19 to a share price of NOK3.5 caused by the Covid, but never truly recovered because of a lack of contracts to find oil, and the way underpriced Oil. Making the recovery much slower for PGS then for the rest of the stock market. 

Now that the price of North-sea oil is again on the rise, with the prospect of maybe even hitting 100$, the $PGS recovery is picking up pace. 

Combine this with the news that today it was announced that Equinor was giving them a contract to find oil, together with Shearwater GeoServices, worth 700 million NOK. Making the stock rise 17% at the time of writing. But there is alot more room to grow back to what they were one year ago. 

There is a small short position at 3,6%, which will be forced to give up pretty soon, as this is not going down again! It wont have the biggest impact on the share price, but its always nice to fuck the shorters. 

Here is my position.

Im holding on for NOK20, as i think its pretty realistic that it gets back to its old value. 

But what do i know? I am a retard, and you should check up and do your own DD, i am definitely not a financial advisor. I just think its a good stock, i like it, with big potential, but as i have said... i am a retard.

My first DD post, so i dont know what the fuck i am doing. please ask questions in the comments if i have forgotten to add anything!
