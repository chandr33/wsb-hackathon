""I hope this is considered worthwhile to not ban me; please be kind WSB mods. I think this is a good talking point. ""  


  
Buying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental

Someone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd ""crash"" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.  


\-------------------------

I've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups. (These pickups have been the daily dips)

&amp;#x200B;

Averaging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB ""strategy"" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.

GME and this short situation makes this one of those situations w*here every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket,* so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point **is my priority.**  


I'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that &amp; 1 share of GME on Robinhood back when it was 80 bucks. ( i know i know) Robinhood is bad, no doubt, BUT The wife is handling robin hood. Its  smaller stakes but she is doing a good job &amp; to me rationalizes still using the platform until i can get her to fidelity  


That's why the fidelity account became our trading platform for main investments, Robinhood for light (math based - non-centralized) ( to avoid the C word) investment and more long term holdings.  Also we have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.

Thank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation.  


As a matter of disclosure {ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment (actually covers across all my trading platforms)} &amp; THE REST IS FUEL FOR THE ROCKET TO MARS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am diamond hand to the moon, but I want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 more full shares in the mean time so I don't have to touch my main shares.  


TLDR: So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough. Don't be afraid of a reasonable change in your price per share if quantity is your main asperation  


Avg per share was 75.55 for 9 ( buying fractionally it has increased to 81.56 for the gain of .39 shares)

A)  We purchase them ourselves, (the best option) 

B)  We sell them at market value (we don't technically lose too much but it hurts us trying to drive the stock to 1k or 10k or the worst option...

C)   We let the options expire useless where they're bought up at the lowest price.

Also comparing charts on Flowtrade. Looking at today we saw a down turn in the big banks in the morning to mid-day and a small recovery at end of day. This is a theory right now, but GME has significant shares held in Eee Tee Effs. In there the largest owners are you guessed it big banks. This may be correlation at best and not causation. I'd love for someone to poke holes in the data. It's still a work in progress and I update as often as I can. I've tried to gather as much applicable data about GME exposure as possible.

In my hightened state of mind, I thought about how $AMC deviated massively from GeeEmmEees action today.

There are a few explanations floating around on this sub about how there was some good news coverage on $AMC and the volume on GeeEmmEee was piss poor. While this explanation is potentially valid, it doesn't really get to the root of why it happened TODAY. AMC has been foreshadowing about reopening in select states for quite a few weeks, yet no dramatic shift between the two stonks happened. But today, this week leading up to Friday, March 19, is apparently the day everyone decides to pick up their bags from GeeEmmEee and jump ship? And the news outlets just happen to cover the rise of $AMC as a legitimate news piece? I don't buy it.

After chewing on the empty glue stick cap for a bit and realizing I actually need to swallow that thing whole, I was blessed with a theory. This may be the hedgies trying to lure us away from GeeEmmEee.

Here's what I know:
 - Stimmy rolling out last weekend and over the course of this week. This is dry powder for the retards to dump into the shit inferno that is GeeEmmEee or $AMC, whatever gets you your allowance.
 - Shitadel had to get a $600M bailout (I'm not gonna soften the term here).
 - Before le Squeeze 1.0, the hedgeies were way more exposed on GeeEmmEee than $AMC (~140%SI vs. ~30%SI).
 - There is a mixed demographic among the retail investors; as in there are people that believe both $AMC and GeeEmmEee are real plays (and that's perfectly fine).
 - The new DTCC margin rules are coming into effect as early as next week.

Here's what I speculate:
 - It doesn't matter too much what you believe the actual SI% is for either stonk, the hedgies are still way more exposed on GeeEmmEee than $AMC. 
 - Last week, some long whales got into the game and really started tightening the wringer on the hedgies. There's a good DD on this over at the other sub, but the ape put his real info in there so I'm not gonna link it.
 - The hedgies understand all of this and they're standing on their last leg of liquidity and strategies.

Here's what I theorize:
 - The rise in $AMC is either due neglect or delivberate pumping by the hedgies.
 - If neglect, the hedgies are really out of liquity and are focusing fire on GeeEmmEee as this would be a much higher risk to them going forward.
 - If deliberate pumping, the hedgies really are out of strategies and is using this as a ""sacrifice an arm to save the head"" approach, to try to lead the people who are on the fence about $AMC and GeeEmmEee to dump their GeeEmmEee position and jump to $AMC; or at least not put as much stimmy money into GeeEmmEee.

If my theory is correct on either counts, then the end really is nigh, for both stonks, and I may have finally earned a wrinkle on my polished brain. I suspect that, seeing the low volume today on GeeEmmEee, I think the apes held well and the hedgies are another day closer to that cardboard box behind the McDick's. So, here's to hoping what I think is a wrinkle on my brain isn't just another cramp.

What is the true intrinsic core value of a stock? Is it the price a stock is selling for on the market? sure if you want to sell it. But what about people holding a stock; what is the value of a stock to it's holders? The value of a stock you are holding is not it's perception by the general public or it's past performance - those things can change at any moment (technically everything can change but some change more than others). The true core intrinsic value of a stock is it's predictive value + the value of it's assets, patents and other transferable intellectual and materialistic property of a company. Always assume the predictive value to be zero. Then what you have left is the brick, gold, metal and cartoon characters like the Avengers and Batman. Marvel may go bankrupt one moment but may rise again in the future thanks to it's copyrighted characters and patents. The value left over is what someone is willing to pay for a hostile takeover or a merger.

If Disney goes bankrupt today then it's assets will still have value. If Microsoft goes bankrupt, if AAPL goes bankrupt. All these companies will have value to their stocks because not only are these guys the leaders in technology but they are also the inventors. These guys are the #1 authority in not just technology and communication; they also share a cozy relationships with governments around the world because they have all the knowledge and data. Netflix was chill when it was new as it was the leader and the inventor, but it's inventions could easily be copied - now everyone is doing what they were long ago. MSFT and AAPL will not go bankrupt that easily because too many powerful people are invested into it. We ourselves are invested into it's technology and above all they have the power to change their own perception and predictive value. They can morph the environment around them to make it adaptable for them to survive.

I already explained Disney and MSFT and AAPL. Verizon is very similar as it has towers and contracts throughout America. Those contracts alone amount to billions. What does TSLA have (an example with a very high PE ratio). TSLA has Elon Musk. Elon Musk is sending rockets into space to create a network for fast internet that anyone in the world can use. This internet may end up coordinating with and having a close relationship with TSLA; thus giving TSLA vehicles an edge in self-driving AI among other things. TSLA has and continues to work on patents that are revolutionizing battery tech. One can safely say that TSLA is not only a technology hub but it is also a ""creator"". So in short we can say that assets that are sellable and transferrable in the now and in the future define a stock's value. TSLA is an abnormal example because unlike MSFT or AAPL we don't know the true potential of it's future inventions. But it's predictive value must be higher than zero because it is not a company that is sitting around doing nothing. We do know that the guy behind it is a creator and he likes to hire engineers who feel the same way. This is why this stock can grow infinitely more. I am 5% into TSLA right now.

Now let's talk about the idea of Americans investing in Chinese companies. What happens if NIO goes bankrupt, can an American take over the company? No they cannot. Can NIO merge with another company if it wants to? no not without China's approval. Are NIO and XPENG #1 in creating technology that can be sold off or transferred? no not at all. They have a contract with Nvidia but Nvidia is a separate company. How reliable are their revenue figures? we have no idea because these companies make up things all the time - Americans cannot regulate or monitor them at all. Why are they selling shares in US then? because people make money off of it. Can the companies effect environment in America to make it more suitable for them? no but they can do it in China. Again, for the Chinese these might be good investments.

What happens if the thing in Myanmar ends up leading to a conflict between China and America? Chinese companies get sanctioned. Your stock hits rock bottom over night. Americans have about zero protection for their stock holdings in China. You can't own land or a company without a Chinese citizen in charge. These guys aren't creating anything so not like they have value beyond their assets or name. China isn't Afghanistan that will bend over backwards to please American shareholders.

What is happening right now is that these companies are being bumped up overnight by a select few hands and then just like your average pyramid scheme - people are throwing their money into them. Sure a stock can rise and get you profit in the long run but these stocks only have value because of hype and perception - which amounts to nothing at the core. China is already sanctioning BABA - it has not been hit by sanctions from America just yet. Look at what happened to Huawei. Tech is the future no doubt, but if you are looking for stable growth rather than a reverse-buffet then I suggest going into an ETF like QQQ.

You are walking on a thin rope when you invest in companies we are about to go to war with. These companies are riding along the TSLA hype train but they have nothing of their own to offer. They have bots spamming our forums convincing people to become future bag holders. Look at Lenovo's yearly net revenue; around 15 billion a year. NIO's net revenue is less than a billion. Lenovo is worth 15 billion in marketcap whereas NIO is worth 70 billion lol. How many people outside China use Lenovo laptops vs NIO cars? I wouldn't invest in either company but you get what I mean. This will probably be my last post. But once again I recommend investing in an ETF like QQQ. I expect big gains in the future. Don't become the lost generation. Especially us millennials; we have suffered a lot at the hands of manipulators and liars.

79,m6342t,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone will see this but I had to get this off my chest because it was bothering me. I‚Äôm sure Bruce is a nice guy but I am disturbed by his coverage of AMC and him putting down AMC shareholders by calling them amateur traders and pitting AMC against GME.

As a preface, **I want both AMC and GME to do well** whether one squeezes before the other or they both squeeze at the same time. However, I completely disagree with Bruce‚Äôs ‚Äúfundamental-based‚Äù analysis of AMC and think it is utterly misinformed, disingenuous, and reckless.

**A Few Things I find Sketch about Bruce (This is merely my opinion and I don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone)**

1.  He asks for donations on PayPal. He does this so that he does not have to pay taxes on that ‚Äúincome.‚Äù Since it is labeled as a donation, which he wants, he doesn‚Äôt declare that money but rather pockets the full amount. Other YouTubers do not do this unless I am missing something.

2.  (please let me know if I am wrong about this point) He claims to have no money in stocks, but I find this extremely hard to believe for a few reasons. First off, he said he used to be a stockbroker and people trust his advice because they believe he is a knowledgeable investor. If he is a good investor, he has to have some money in an appreciating asset class, whether that is real estate, commodities or some other alternative asset. I find it hard to believe he is storing all of his money in cash/savings, especially with ongoing fears of inflation. Being involved with the capital markets for many years now, I would expect that he has investments in the stock market. All I am saying is he never shows his screens, and we will never know the truth. I actually appreciate that the other Youtubers show their portfolio and even though there are biases, it is obvious, and they are upfront.

3.  Finally, call me a skeptic, but Bruce is a salesman by trade. That is what a stockbroker is. Just think about the Wolf of Wall Street and think does this man have your best interest at heart. Maybe he does but the entire PayPal donation and charging 400 dollars for a session sounds fishy to me. No offense, but there are very few people I would pay 400 dollars to talk to and Bruce certainly is not one of them.

**WHY HE IS SO WRONG ABOUT AMC FUNDAMENTALS (I respect those who believe in GME‚Äôs bull thesis but please do not put down AMC and its shareholders).**

1.  I don‚Äôt care what anyone says but Bruce has not done full DD on AMC and it shows. I don‚Äôt know if he believes he will make more money if he simply panders to one audience (GME) or if he genuinely believes what he says.

2.  From an asymmetrical risk to reward ratio, AMC makes more sense for me at this current valuation, whereas I find it much harder to justify GME‚Äôs valuation. I know people are in it for the squeeze/momentum, but Bruce likes to talk fundamentals.

3.  People like Bruce love to mention AMC‚Äôs debt, and I think it is important, but they fail to realize that it was strategic debt. AMC was investing heavily for the future. They by far have the best and most innovative movie theater experiences in the world with the dine-in setup where waiters take your order at your seat and bring the food to your seat, the incredible recliner seats, Dolby Cinema, etc. Additionally, they were acquiring theater chains in Europe and expanding into the Middle East. This strategic debt has allowed them to separate themselves from the competition and they were not expecting the pandemic to hit and cause such a strain.

4.  AMC is a business with a moat around it. They have 80 percent market share in the US, whereas Cinemark only has around 20 percent, yet analysts say invest in Cinemark because they do not have debt. This is stupidity. People that think AMC is going down simply believe movie theaters will go extinct, which again the numbers show that this is extremely misguided. From 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic, AMC was having its best years. The box office was in its golden age. AMC was bringing in over 5 billion dollars with growth year over year. People will say it was because of Avengers, but filmmaking is continuing to grow with technological advancements and certain films must be watched in theaters for the full experience. Across the board, we were seeing groundbreaking numbers whether it was horror (Get Out, Us, A Quiet Place, It), films like Crazy Rich Asians, A Star is Born, all of the Kevin Hart and Rock films, all the Disney movies, DC movies, and so much more.

5.  I believe GME has a much tougher road ahead of them. I hope they succeed but they are relying on a pivot into a whole new business model, which is e-commerce where they will face off against giants like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. I also understand that they are trying to become the social and cultural hub for gaming, but there is no guarantee for that as gamers like to be in the comforts of their homes and can interact through mics and chat.

6.  GME folks believe in Ryan Cohen, and we have just as much right to believe in Adam Aron, who is the trailblazer in this industry. He was the CEO of Royal Caribbean and of the 76ers. Also, he has been making deals with production companies/streaming services that everyone fails to mention. He made a first-of-its-kind deal with Universal where AMC will get a portion of their digital rental income. AMC did this by refusing to showcase Universal movies after they said they would simultaneously release films in theaters and on digital rental services. AMC has power as well; remember, the box office is the quickest way for production companies to make hundreds of millions and billions rather than relying on subscriber growth, and AMC charges for screens and takes a chunk of that box office.

7.  Finally, this thought that AMC is going to issue shares and screw us is blatantly false. Adam Aron is on our side and wants us to be successful and also knows if he issues shares, he will lose more money in the long run because he will lose all of this newfound support for AMC just to raise quick money by issuing shares and diluting existing shareholders. Furthermore, the retail investors have a huge say in this now, as we get to vote on any possible share issuance. I actually firmly believe Aron is doing this to screw the shorts as a share recount must be conducted to expose any synthetic and falsified shares. Also, Aron keeps saying they have plenty of cash in the bank and the upcoming movie slate is extremely strong, and also, we have that vote all the way in May, which is not even to issue shares but rather to simply expand the number of shares in the future if they want to issue shares. Bruce should know that there is a long process in order to issue shares. Companies need shareholder approval, as well as a prospectus, receiving an application of shares, allotment of shares, and a call on shares.  You cannot simply come out the next day and do so. AMC was lucky in February as they had the filings already prepared previously, but this supposed share issuance is not worrying any of us AMC shareholders. We can say the same thing about GME but we are not.

**SQUEEZE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH AMC AND GME**

1.  I believe that both are prime squeeze candidates but don‚Äôt take it from me. Ihor Dusaniwsky, who is the managing director at S3 Partners, one of the premier data reporting services with regards to short data gives both AMC and GME a score of 10 on his squeeze score metric. Keep in mind he has been doing this for decades now.

2.  Also, with regards to a gamma squeeze, when you look at the volume for the options on barchart, AMC actually has the most volume out of any stock only behind Apple (which is always #1). GME is nowhere to be found at the top of that list, but this can quickly change.

Again, I never do this kind of thing, but I felt it was necessary. There is so much more I could say but that is already a lot. No disrespect to Bruce but I hope he sees this and reconsiders his outlook on AMC or just the whole movement in general rather than pitting AMC and GME against one another.
