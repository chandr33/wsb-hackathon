9,lw8cmg,"I literally only joined Reddit to join this sub because I had serious FOMO about a month ago. I have been trading for a little over a year and the only thing I’ve learned that I am really good at is buying high and selling slightly higher. My gains have been so good, I’ve been able to order two hamburgers from Wendy’s rather than just one. (Basically I haven’t made much) but I always pick the long plays. That is until FOMO got the best of me with GME and man was holding tough during those dark weeks in February. Serious depression at times no doubt.

Regardless, I am going to present an analysis on the current situation. As I said - new to Reddit and no idea how to post a picture of what I am seeing but take a look at GME on your stock app and look at the little hill before the test launch. We are currently in a very similar spot, except that hill was around 80-85 and this one is around 125. My math is about as good as some of the high school freshman and sophomores on this sub, so I’ll be presenting my math to the best of my ability. Let’s go off 83 from the previous hill and compare to now. This hill is 150.06% higher than the previous hill before take off. We then got our test rocket up to $483. By that same analysis we are poised for this rocket to land on the moon somewhere around $742 (buying restrictions included). Once this rocket exits the atmosphere no one know what to expect from the space aliens (aka hedgies/trading institutions) so we could be met with resistance again which would put us on the moon somewhere around there, but my guess is that this rocket is primed for dodging interception and we will go higher. Citadel already said last time should have gone into the thousands if it weren’t for Vlad’s ED issues. 

Just remember apes. The moon is where we stock up for fuel and to grab some munchies before our next destination. Keep those 💎👐 steady and wave at the space aliens while smiling on your way to Pluto, knowing that your wife is in good hands with her boyfriend.

It appears RKT is delaying our departure today so go watch your wife and her BF perform acts of intimacy one more time before lift off and enjoy the last few hours on earth. 

Cheers Gents (and the lady)
