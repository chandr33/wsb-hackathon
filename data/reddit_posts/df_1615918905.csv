15,m6fpcv," Hey there fellow apes. I’ve been a longtime lurker here (and on reddit) and wanted to give my two cents on the GME situation and in specific relating it to the so called ‘Prisoner’s dilemma’.

For the ones who aren’t familiar with the prisoner’s dilemma here is a quick explanation:

The prisoner’s dilemma is a hypothetical scenario in which two criminal accomplices are arrested and are placed in separate chambers. The prosecuting officers don’t have enough evidence to convict each criminal. So, they propose an offer to the criminals to betray their accomplice. So the following situations could arise:

Situation 1: Criminal 1 and Criminal 2 betray each other and both end up in prison.

Situation 2: Criminal 1 rats on criminal 2. Criminal 1 gets set free, criminal 2 gets put in jail for 3 years. (and vice versa)

Situation 3: Both criminals stay silent and get released from police custody.

A lot of people (shills) are saying that we should sell, because we can’t trust all the retail retards who bought GME, thus being in a prisoner’s dilemma as retail GME holder. WRONG.

This is not true. Disregarding all the great DD that has already been done and all the odds that are stacked in our favor, I’ll sketch the following scenario:

Imagine you are a successful hedgefund manager, have around 20B in assets under your management. You shorted GME and are right now left holding your dick in your hand. Your fund is deep red in the losses. All the market manipulation amounted to nothing and you underestimated ‘dumb money apes’. Your hedgefund, without doubt, will bankrupt when GME inevitably squeezes. But, you have the options to take your losses, cover your shorts, eat the big loss, BUT survive. By covering, you essentially save your own career and ass, but fuck over your fellow GME short hedgefucks. THE ONES HAVING A PRISONER’S DILEMMA ISN’T US(RETAIL), IT’S THE BIG HEDGEFUNDS, SHITADEL etc. that have everything to lose when GME inevitably squeezes.

So do not fret. Fuck all the FUD. Retail investors will come out on top( we have nothing to lose and the world to gain) and just BUY AND HOLD and eventually you’ll be able to buy that lambo for your wife’s boyfriend.

Lesson of the day: 🎓
What is the utilization rate and what is AMC’s rate? What does it mean for AMC ?🎥🍿

So Amc is currently at 84.62% according to Ortex.

In Smart Ape language : it’s number of shares borrowed by hedgies/short sellers/market makers divided by total lendable shares by other institutional lenders/hedgies. 
——-
In Smooth Ape Language (the fun begins): 

Gorillas 🦍 = We the average retailers
Snakes 🐍 = Hedgies 
Lions 🦁 = Institutional Lenders that run the kingdom

*** STORY TIME***

The snakes 🐍 wanna take away the bananas from the gorillas and double, triple, 10x their own banana count.

But the snake 🐍 currently doesn’t have enough bananas in his own possession to make the strategic moves he and other snakes thought of, so he needs to borrow from someone he KNOWS has some. None other than the kingdom rulers themselves. The lions 🦁.

So the lion 🦁 says: I’ve got 100M bananas 🍌 total in my name that I’m willing to allow you to borrow. And I gave up 84.62% of them. So if you want the rest or some of my bananas, my interest has gone up because I have less availability. Might have more soon, might have less. Idk. But you snakes have been bombarding me for bananas the last 2 months. 

Snake 🐍 says “screw it, 😤 I’ll take them because my pride is too great and the gorillas are holding on to their bananas like diamond hands and its become harder to hoard them myself because they have been growing their bananas in the backyard each day. Ughhh, I even bet with other cobras and gorillas that their bananas production will go down. And its doing the opposite!!! 🐍😬 So I need to show them who’s boss!” 

Lion 🦁 says:”go for it! Here take another 20M  but i want them back.” 💸💰

**SO WHAT DO THE GORILLAS DO TO BE AHEAD OF THEM?✊**

Gorilla 🦍 says to Gorilla Kingdom: “haha, look at these 1000 smart snakes trying to out think 10 million smooth apes...i may eat crayons when im alone but when it’s me and the boys/girls we eat snakes.....! Alright boys 🦍and gorilla gals🦧, if you see other apes selling for low price. Buy!!! If not, do Nothing else but keep holding the bananas and continue to grow them in the backyard. Eventually their time will run out, there won’t be enough bananas to be passed around amongst lions. And they’ll have lost on other tactics (options) and be forced to buy up all the bananas they promised to give back and never did because they sold them all to us. But we like our bananas ripe. And we don’t wanna give them back. Well, not unless they pay me $1000 per banana. So... yeah”

Fin. Thanks for reading! 

A thumbs up and share with people to spread knowledge ! 👍

Ps: Friday will be fun 🙂 LOTS of bananas going to be made available for purchase on Monday cuz if not. Snakes are gonna be tied up and Lions gonna be very mad.",(STORY TIME) “What is the Utilization rate for AMC?” as explained by an Ape for other Apes.,1.0,1615920140,supahotfiiire

The actual likelihood of it happening is very slim and hinges on so many different factors, but say the millions of shares owned by retail investors actually pay out billions in total, billions that were essentially being hoarded by the hedge funds and the ultra rich, and now that wealth is distributed between thousands, of not millions of average Joes and Jolenes! We’re products of capitalism and we do what we do best; spend, spend, spend! Our money gets taxed and filtered back through the economy, reinvigorating small business and public spending on a real and novel way! 

This growth in public spending may even highlight the need for wealth redistribution on a larger scale and we might even see higher taxes for the top percentile of earners!

94,m6g56j,"GameStop Stock Tumbles, but Analyst Still Sees Squeeze Potential

Gamestop stock dropped again shortly after the market opened on Tuesday. While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.
Shares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock’s one-year low of $2.57.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron’s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.
Dusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.
“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky added.

1. Can this, or a modified version of this, work?

So less exciting but possibly profitable, good for stock market.

Here's why I think about investment (am ape):

* I've worked from home for 10 years and know how fatiguing it gets. About 3 years in I started splitting my time between home and Starbucks's.
* However, SBUX sucks for extended WFH and the vibe sucks. Traditional offices are gross and stuffy.
* Coworking spaces are generally better and WeWork is easily the best, albeit expensive. Proof? Go to Santa Monica. I toured 10 coworking spaces in SM a few years ago and they all were TERRIBLE except for 3- WeWork, ROC, and this spot Obama spoke at once. I chose ROC. They evicted all their tenants after not paying their sublease bill.
* Most WFHers have started to experience this kind of fatigue, but I think they're still early on the fatigue and we'll see that more.
* If post-pandemic, we see a net bump in permanent WFH and remote workers, there will be a greater need for good coworking spaces. And WeWork wins. Especially if most of these permanent WFHers are not in the same city as their employer, where WeWork gets their customers in company hubs in multiple cities.
* If post-pandemic, we instead see any net increase WFH coming from people living in the city, aka partial WFH, they'll probably just come into the office to get out of the house instead of a coworking space.

So (more responsible WeWork + to-be-seen WFH fatigue) \* (probability of post-pandemic WFH) = buy

No clue about the specifics of these numbers or evidence that WeWork got their head out their ass.
