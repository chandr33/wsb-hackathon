76,m4j5s5,"# DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE OR 100% BASED ON FACT(S). THIS IS SIMPLY EDUCATIONAL AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION.

# TL;DR: Capital gains tax, easing and even erasing debt, financial stimulus to peoples all over the world, a happier and more compliant population, tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters, and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster.

We all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes, and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money.

However, when looking at the bigger picture, there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run.

Let's take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning;

# 1.) Capital Gains Tax

When people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur, governments will attain taxes off these investments. Considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money, that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy.

This is especially considering how 40% of America's money has been printed in the last year due to COVID-19. Instead of raising taxes on the American people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run, the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary.

Also, with more money gained from stocks, many will likely re-invest some (or even most) of their money back into the stock market; leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped.

# 2.) People being more willing and able to spend, further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population

It's no surprise that when times are tougher economically, people tend to spend less and save more. Yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable, this makes economic times rougher, which in turn...

Leads to a potentially endless economic recession/depression.

We've seen this in Japan in the late 1990's and early 2000's, and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980. They've gone backwards in terms of their financial progression.

With the general population in possession of large sums of money, however, this allows the economy to be stimulated; which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes, but also creates a happier population overall.

Imagine it; after a year of prolonged quarantine, job loss, future inflation and economic instability, all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes...

Suddenly get served justice...

Then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them, fought the fight to the end, and helped make the world a better place.

This is practically the script to Endgame; heck, most action/heroic movies. And the American people get to be a part of it.

Speaking of ""bad guys"";

# 3.) The gains also won't be in the hands of large tax dodgers

We all know that tax dodging is practiced by many, especially those in large positions of power and wealth. 

So is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big Wall Street players are dodging taxes?

For the U.S. government, this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt, fortifying infrastructure, improving medical and educational institutions, and many more benefits for Americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individual's bank accounts filled with zero's. 

With the money in the hands of the average citizen, however, the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud (if at all) on a massive level. 

Of course, they won't go out quietly when the squeezes happen, yet that can still be a good thing because;

# 4.) The stock market needs a correction

Many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the American economy, and that a correction is inevitable.

When the squeezes happen for meme stocks, however, after the new DTCC rule comes into effect, that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions.

They'll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes; causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market.

Yet once the dust settles, people can finally reassess the market(s) and determine where everything should be.

Stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again, while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down.

Then, the economy can become stabilized again, and everything can continue as it should.

# Whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me, and only based on the information I currently know. 

# There's far more that could and could not happen based on if/when meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices.

# But most importantly, I wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon, and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community.

# So what do you think?",How the United States government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon,0.89,1615680554,fortifier22
