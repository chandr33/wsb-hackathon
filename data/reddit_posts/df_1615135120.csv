10,lzucev,"Premier African Minerals (LON:PREM) EPO application to expand it's Zulu lithium project by 20,200 hectares when granted, could potentially make it one the biggest lithium projects in the world

Most genuine shareholders believe that Zulu is huge and could be good. But just how good isn't easy to visualise. Zulu's Scoping Study or PEA if you prefer to call it that prepared by BARA Consulting helps. In that we‚Äôre given some reference pointers that are extremely useful. But although the PEA lays a marker in sand it gives very little guidance on scale and therefore potential which is what investors are keen to see and are understandably very interested in.

What BARA have done is prepared a statement of fact on a fully SAMREC compliant but relatively very short length of just one of the known lithium strikes on the existing license area. That's all they're allowed and were remitted to do. Consultants like BARA aren‚Äôt given to speculation. They have to be ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù and deal with what they're asked to do. So BARA put together their Scoping Study and designed a business model for a small mine around what the Scoping Study covers and no more. That's the extent of it!

But as I say BARA‚Äôs appraisal and models were based upon just 15% of one known strike which is just a small fraction of what's been identified so far through subsequent drilling just on the current licensed area. It follows therefore that BARA‚Äôs business models must be minimalist and it should be read in that light. In just about every case mining reserves and resources increase over the Life Of Mine and mining plans change accordingly. That will apply nevermore so than in Zulu‚Äôs case.

So Prem used the Scoping Study as a basis and from it estimated an overall resource. Prem made their estimate known to shareholders saying it was an estimate and should be used for guidance only. But what Prems estimate did is give an indication of scale much better than the Scoping Study. It was based upon drill results and shouldn't be considered as simply as Prems guess. It‚Äôs much more accurate and scientific than that.

If anything, Prems' estimate was more likely to be conservative than not. Later in the drilling campaign Prem undertook further drilling to delineate newly discovered strikes that appeared to run on to the site boundaries and beyond. I believe those findings are just drillers notes and assays so far and are neither disclosed or included in Prems estimate. To get a better idea of the effect of scale here's some benchmarking and calculations of my own. If I'm near anywhere near right the results are simply breathtaking!

If the licensed area stays unaltered and we take Prems highest target resource we have a resource of 160mt's @ 1.06% Li2O. Prem derived that from the known and measured strike used in the SS and extrapolated it on a straightforward pro-rata basis. There were further strikes subsequently discovered after the SS but they weren‚Äôt counted in the estimate.

The drilling was carried out purposely to delineate those strikes up to the boundaries and perhaps helped to justify Prems EPO application.

So if we assume the 160mt's is about right. LCE prices are currently about $12k/t and rising under improving market conditions is much much stronger than the last rally that saw the LCE price top $20k/t.

The conversion factor from Li2O to LCE is x 2.473. So for ease of maths let's say the current Li2O price is $30k/t. That would give Zulu an ‚Äúin-ground‚Äù value of 160m x 1.06% x $30k which is $51bn. It‚Äôs worth reiterating as I've used it later. $51bn!

The largest hard rock lithium resource in the world is owned by AVZ Minerals in the DRC and it‚Äôs resource there was increased to over 400mt's @ 1.66% Li2O giving it an ‚Äùin ground‚Äù value of $200bn on the same [basis.So](https://basis.so/) some 4x higher in value than Zulu‚Äôs estimate. But Zulu‚Äôs has only been based on the current licensed area.

Zulu is also often benchmarked against Pilbara's mine in Australia too given it's of a similar size with similar grades. But Pilbara‚Äôs development is ahead of Zulu and it‚Äôs in production now. It's resource is 216mt's @ 1.13% Li2O or something like that. So it's ‚Äúin ground‚Äù value is $70 bn just less than 50% higher in value than Zulu.

All very interesting. As is the fact that Zulu‚Äôs Lithium is very high quality much higher than that of AVZ and Pilbaras . It has a very low iron content which sets it‚Äôs above most of its piers in the space. For that reason it‚Äôs sure to be much more highly sought after by battery manufacturers come the day.

These mines are massive and highly profitable at today's LCE price by any measure. Pilbara's original mining plan was to produce over 300kt‚Äôs of battery grade Spodumene from a Run Of Mine of 2mt's/annum giving the mine a LOM of over 20 years. That‚Äôs short ccompared to Zulus potential.

But that changed. Pilbara has doubled its ROM capacity to 5mt's/annum . It‚Äôs Market Cap from producing 300kt‚Äôs of Concentrate per year is $1.2bn with it‚Äôs All in Costs likely to be higher than Zulus which bodes well for Prem.

Now here's the sting in the tail. Well for other miners at least. Prem's EPO application increases Zulu's mining area from 350ha currently under license to over 20,020ha. That‚Äôs 57 x bigger!

So if you imagine the resource continues at the same density across the EPO area that would give Zulu an ‚Äúin ground‚Äù value of over $2.4 trillion. That‚Äôs fifteen times higher in value than the largest mine of it's kind in the world and forty times higher in value than Pilbara. All of a sudden Pilbara starts to take the size of a minnow such is the potential of Zulu!

Some like to value mines based on the value ‚Äúin-ground‚Äú. It‚Äôs a quick and easy way and it‚Äôs a method adopted quite often. We saw GR do it in one of his Webinars.

I'm not a fan of this valuation method to be honest. There are better ways to value Zulu such as benchmarking, discounted cash flows and using an earning metric which I think is most common.Far better. However now I've mentioned the ‚Äúin ground ‚Äú values it's just worth saying that using a factor of 1.5% to calculate Zulu's Market Cap. Based on the current licenced area and LCE at $12k/t would be around $750m. However if LCE were to be more like $20k/t which I think is more realistic Zulu's Market Cap would be around $1.25bn

However in its larger area Zulus value would be multiples of that . But whether it would be 57 times more is questionable in my mind.

As you're probably aware, increasing the resource and/or extending the LOM has little impact on the Market Cap of a mine and its Share Price in most cases. That's understandable given profitability usually remains largely unchanged. If the production level is unaltered it simply means the mine stays operational longer. So no big deal really especially when the LOM is reasonably long anyway. However I believe Zulu's situation couldn't be more different.

As I see it if the licence area remains unchanged we're unlikely to see Zulu plan to produce Lithium Carbonate from a chemical plant on site. Due to current site area constraints if Zulu wants to produce Lithium Carbonate we may have to opt for using the shared facility in Bulawayo.

On the other hand if the licence area increases by a reasonable margin in the current EPO it may be possible for Zulu to have its own dedicated chemical plant adjacent to produce Lithium in Carbonate form.

For the purposes here I'm going to ignore the Carbonate option but wear my positive hat and assume Prems EPO application is successful. I'm going to predict Lithium prices at the point of production three years out in 2024/5.

So please bear those two things in mind. As I say I‚Äôve tried to be conservative in other areas but in my view they‚Äôre factors that shouldn't be ignored and left unconsidered

Battery grade Spodumene was selling for around $900/t &amp; $1000/t during the last bull run when the market price for Lithium Carbonate Equivalent was around $10,500/t.That‚Äôs reflected in the BARA report too. So projected off takers prices then say $1500/t for Zulus Spodumene and $20k/t for LCE seems reasonable.

If I count the Petalite and Tantalum I'll ramble on forever and it's going to make the maths quite difficult to follow. So I've assumed they cancel each other out and ignored them. I think it's a reasonable assumption and conservative too.

I've also used Zulu‚Äôs PEA and Prospects Arcadia Mine in Zimbabwe where I can for references to make my statements and calculations more factual and less ‚Äúdreamy‚Äù. There are some key non-disclosures on their offtake agreements in Prospects presentations which is a shame but understandable for confidentiality.

Prospect haven't long entered into a seven year offtake agreement with Sinomine a Chinese offtaker on a build and transfer basis. Sinomine have agreed to design and build the mine but then transfer ownership of it to Prospect in a share swap arrangement of $10m for 10% stake and an offtake agreement for 70% of the lithium Concentrate produced for the next six years.

Prospect has a say in the mine's design and takes ownership of it when it's built. They pay for it‚Äôs cost then over a three year payback period I believe. It sounds a good arrangement but Sinomines payment rates under the agreement are undisclosed so I can‚Äôt be entirely sure.

Now here's an interesting part. Prospect has the right under the agreement to divert up to 50% of their Concentrate at any time to an owned Carbonate plant. That is step change for them given they've got the room on site. Their licensed area is 4 x the size of Zulu‚Äôs current license area.

Arcadia managed to start production within a year from a ‚Äúspade in the ground‚Äù which is very quick especially considering the climatic conditions. Their plan was to produce 200 kt's/annum of lithium Petalite Concentrate and over 150kt‚Äôs of Spodumene Concentrate initially and whilst those targets may have been met they‚Äôve just opened a chemical plant and are now producing Carbonate too.

The Arcadia mine in Zimbabwe is said to one of a group of mines that are the largest hard rock lithium mines in the world. At 0.2% cut off I think they have a resource of about 75mt's at similar grades to Prem. To put that into perspective Zulu has an assessed but well estimated target of twice that on just its current licensed area. Like all appraisals logistics must be considered. It will be the pinch point for Zulu in my view. I doubt we will be able to ship much more than 300kt's/annum by road.

So with my positive hat on I like to imagine Zulu in 3 phases. Viz:-

PHASE1 DFS - I think Zulu could command a $200m to $300m Market Cap at this stage or more subject to reasonable fundamentals which I'm confident we'll see given the market outlook. If there are offers from suitors at this point Zulu‚Äôs value could be more. Substantially more and I see that as a real possibility.

I've derived the basic value from Prospects' deal with Sinomine where it was given a similar value in the same time &amp; space. So if we say Prem has 25bn shares in issue then we get to a share price contribution of around 1p to Prem. Fairly straightforward.

PHASE 2 in 2021 Zulu should be producing Lithium Concentrate. $120m Capex or thereabouts will be needed to build a Concentrate facility. So we should expect something like a 25% dilution to raise Capex finance in a 50/50 debt to equity fundraise.

Zulu should achieve a rate of 2m/t ROM/annum [u/1](https://www.reddit.com/u/1/).06% Li2O grade quite easily and similar to it‚Äôs industry peers. That would produce 300 kts &gt;6% Spodumene at a quality better than battery grade. With a $1.5k/t offtake agreement that would give Zulu a $450m/annum revenue. C3 costs or All In Costs if you prefer from the BARA report should be no more than $550/t or $165m annualised. So the Tantalum credit at 60 ppm grade should cover most of those . ""Earnings‚Äù therefore would be in the region of $375m giving Zulu's notional Market Cap of $3.75bn using a P/E ratio of 10 in an earrings metric calculation. In turn a contribution then to Prems Market Cap of $2.8bn. Prem having retained 75% ownership. This is very much in line with Pilbara‚Äôs appraisal.

Even if Prem had say 30bn shares in issue by then Zulu would contribute roughly 7p to it's SP at current exchange rates.

PHASE 3 beyond 2028 - Zulu could be one of the largest producing Lithium Carbonate mines from a hard rock source in the world. At least $500m Capex is going to be needed to build a chemical plant capable of producing 80kt's to 100kt's of Carbonate. I see most of that being funded out off WIP though with very little or no dilution or debt.

Projected revenue from the sale of 80kt's Carbonate should be near $1.6bn/annum and projected All In Costs should be around $5k/t so perhaps $400m/annum. The cost figures have come from benchmarking against Zulu's piers.

With earnings then of $1.1bn the maths tells us we're looking at a Market Cap of $10bn and therefore a contribution to Prems SP of 33p or thereabouts. I said at the beginning of this the figures would be breathtaking and I think that one certainly is! Whilst Prem's notional Market Cap wouldn‚Äôt be the highest in the Lithium space most but not all of the others are miners processing the metal from solution rather than hard rock.

It's worth reiterating that the figures I‚Äôve arrived at for the Concentrate alternative are projected three years out and those for the Carbonate alternative are projected six years out. We could well be looking at a huge mining operation in Zulu. Quite possibly the largest of its kind in the world.

The ratios of value to cost have been derived from Zulu‚Äôs PEA and there‚Äôs some rounding for ease of maths.

It's not too difficult to imagine Zulu and/or Prem coming under pressure from hostile takeover offers at or even before the point of DFS. Especially if the licenced area is increased. I've made Prem‚Äôs management aware of my concerns and asked them to do whatever they can to protect Prems shareholders as much as possible and to take steps to mitigate this risk.

AIMHO &amp; GLA genuine shareholders.

Current short interest on FUBO has been seemingly removed from popular outlets, and i think i know why - but unfortunately for shorts I can stitch their fuck-up together myself.

Get ready to laugh, look at what these dipshits did.

\*The Float is **54mm** shares\* - *same as you-know-who.*

Late February the short interest on FUBO was **27% = 14.5mm shares**

Early March, ahead of earnings, shorts added another **5mm = 19.5mm**

Now were up to 36% - large but nothing to write home about

***Ok.. get ready***

Earnings come out and show a wide EPS miss **( wait for it )**

For the rest of the week, shorts add 21 MILLION more shares short. **76% OF THE FLOAT.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Over 21mm shares added short last week](https://preview.redd.it/ge644tkixml61.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3b4a1582ac0304d28770d9a163a1d8e52db80e)

**41 MILLION SHARES CURRENTLY SHORT.**

There are currently only 1.2mm shares left to borrow.

Quick recap before we move forward:

Shorts added approx. **26 MILLION shares short** over the last **2 weeks.**

Based on a reporting error, they now have a dogshit entry and have completed fucked themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d4em4lhlxml61.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa01620fe985bada47d8b52843c16391a9e0ac6

**There's roughly 26 million shares short over the last 2 weeks, at an estimated avg of $35.**

Shorts thought they had it in the bag, market was fuk - FUBO EPS miss was huge, so why was this one of the biggest fuck ups ive ever seen, second only to GME?

Because FUBO actually beat earnings. No, fucking destroyed them. The same way **RKT** did.

The numbers were picked up by algos and reported via media outlets *AHEAD of the company's earnings call where they revised GAAP.*

( added the details of this in first comment below to keep this short for the retards )

I can see how this reporting error was overlooked, the entire market was bleeding this week. HF‚Äôs probably saw EPS miss, ‚Äúok short it‚Äù, and then moved on to other tickers.

This has created a ticking time bomb. They might be unaware that they've just shorted one of the most aggressive growth stocks on the market today. FUBO is the #1 sports streaming service out there, by far. Now they've partnered with MLB, NBA, and Caesars Entertainment to bring to life **SPORTS BETTING** via Fubo Sportsbook.

Not only that - but management is on a media run **3.8 thru 3.15 ( remember this part )**

Its **VERY LIKELY** that management will clear up the ER reporting issue, and that HF/Shorts will realize their mistake, and this is where the fun starts.

We've all seen what happened to **RKT**, when a company crushes earnings and shorts are sent scrambling.

We all watched what happened at **GME** when HFs were forced to buy almost the entire float of a stock.

I.M.O $FUBO is positioned to have an eerily similar move, its got the same float as GameStop ( 54mm ) and 75% short - and it just crushed earnings, the way RKT did.

With stimmy passing yesterday, the market is gonna be on a green, pussy-grippin rip mission and FUBO is going with it.

Add in the 76% short interest, and 2 media conferences where management will clear up the reporting issue - we got ourselves a live one over the next 2 weeks.

Its difficult to set price targets when you have such a squeeze potential, you don't know how much retail will get involved, etc - but ill base these on market cap:

* Conservative - $60-$65 ( $6B Market Cap )
* Median $85-90 ( $10B Market Cap )
* Full on Squizz Party - $100-$120 ( $12-$13B Market Cap )

Considering the market caps of ROKU ( $45B ) and DKNG ( $24B ) i think the above is actually pretty reasonable. FUBO i.m.o will reach $200 ( $21B ) when they launch the sportsbook in Q4.

39,m039gr,"The early lockup period on DASH ends on Tuesday, and DASH is going to fall like a stone. To understand why, first you have to understand (1) how massively over-valued DoorDash is, (2) the factors that have led to this valuation, and (3) why these factors are all going away this week.

&amp;#x200B;

**DASH is massively over-valued, even by meme stock standards**

We all know that many stocks are currently ""over-valued"" according to traditional value metrics. This is especially true of emerging technology stocks, and has been fueled by historically low interest rates and rampant speculation. However, you don't even have to believe that this bubble is going to burst in order to see that DoorDash will fall; ***DASH is massively over-valued even just comparing it to its peers.***

Let's look at DASH's public peers, namely Uber, Lyft, and GrubHub. Now, ride-hailing services are a different business than food delivery, but the technology involved it similar so I believe we can expect similar revenue multiples.

&amp;#x200B;

*Uber:* [\[1\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=uber)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $16.2B*

*Current market cap: $103.21B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 6.37*

&amp;#x200B;

*Lyft:* [\[2\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=lyft)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.1B*

*Current market cap: $21.09B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 6.8*

&amp;#x200B;

*GrubHub:* [\[3\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=grub)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $2.2B*

*Current market cap: $5.61B*

*Forward P/S forecast: 2.25*

&amp;#x200B;

*GrubHub:* [\[4\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=dash)

*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.7B*

*Current market cap: $48.11B*

*Forward P/S forecast:* ***13.01***

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, DASH is trading at a **200% higher forward P/S compared to Uber and Lyft!** And a 600% higher forward P/S compared to GrubHub! This is in spite of the fact that Uber and Lyft will still be experiencing a Covid headwind for the first half of 2021, while DoorDash will no longer benefit from the Covid-driven demand surge in the second half of 2021. So 2022 should favor Uber and Lyft even more over DASH.

For DASH to simply come back down to valuation multiples similar to Uber and Lyft, it would need to drop from its current price of \~$150, down to \~**$75.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Covid, a small float, Covid, low interest rates, Covid, and IPO mania have led to this valuation**

The first factor is that DASH currently has a very small float, due to the lockup agreement from the IPO. DoorDash has a total of 286.34M shares outstanding, with only 97.61M currently available for trading [\[6\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dash). 114M more of those shares will be unlocked for trading on Tuesday, as the first of two lockup periods ends (the other lockup period ends in May).

A small float makes it very easy for a stock to be moved up on small volume. DASH only has an average volume of 3.75M. This means that on Tuesday, ***30x the daily volume will be available for sale.***

In addition, DASH IPO'd at the exact right time to fetch an insane valuation. DoorDash raised $400 in a venture capital round in June 2020, at a value of $16B. This would give DASH a share price today of **\~$50.** But Covid caused insane (and temporary) growth in DoorDash's revenue, which drove up excitement in the company. In addition, the IPO markets reached dot-com-bubble levels of froth (the last time IPOs would pop 100% on their first day of trading) this past year. That's why ***DoorDash rushed to IPO at the end of this year*** [\[7\]](https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/the-rush-to-ipo-before-2020-ends/97862).

&amp;#x200B;

**The bubble is ready to burst**

Life will return to relative normalcy sometime this year. Demand for food delivery services will plummet. At the same time, interest rates are surging higher, which will continue to kill emerging tech growth stocks. The rampant speculation we've seen over the past year will die down soon. I believe DoorDash employees and insiders know (or at least fear) this, and will sell massive quantities of their shares this week as the lockup period expires. 

Keep in mind that this early lockup period only releases **40%** of employees' shares. If you joined DoorDash in 2018 when it was worth only **$1.4B(!)** [\[8\]](https://craft.co/doordash/funding-rounds) and became a multi-multi-millionaire as you saw the market cap of a company that pretty much everybody hates grow **30x** in 2 years, wouldn't you sell 40% of your shares the first time you got the chance?

So if you're a FuboTV enthusiast like myself, you know that in the last week or so, Yahoo Finance has been bombarding their FuboTV news with a shareholder's alert of a class action lawsuit. The timing and length seemed very odd to me, because it happened right after Fubo's earnings call as well as intent on expanding their business to the sports betting market.

So, I started to do a little digging, and found that Yahoo Inc. is owned by Verizon Media (CEO of Verizon named Guru Gowrappan). When I searched for Verizon, what was one of the top searches that I find?:

""**Verizon Media plans virtual reality sports betting app**""

[https://www.fiercevideo.com/tech/verizon-media-plans-virtual-reality-sports-betting-app](https://www.fiercevideo.com/tech/verizon-media-plans-virtual-reality-sports-betting-app)

This scummy CEO is abusing his platform to destroy the reputation of his future competition, so that he can try and promote a Verizon Sports Betting App! This is the most blatant libel case I have ever seen, and I really hope FuboTV plans to counter-sue.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are just a few of the class action notifications that Yahoo Finance has been spamming the last week:

But what if we instead of citing a company name or ticker we used images or used a random code that added noise. Example

[Use image instead of text](https://preview.redd.it/90m9xffibpl61.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1087d5d9dbfb71d966bef46edc066525c9ccf03b)

We don't need everyone to adopt that practice, if a few do, the signal is already noised enough. For example, saying GM3 randomly or using an image, or adding random characters already mess with many of the scrappers and auto-collectors.

RBLX is going public on Wednesday 3.10.21. The price is expected to be roughly $45 a share. Even though that is completely overvalued I'm in! I've seen the numbers, I've done my research, and it's a terrible investment... so I'm buying. 

Recently my wife discovered that most of the discretionary spending goes directly into the pockets of Only Fans e-girls. She made me swear off of them so now I'm stuck with all this cash I can't help but waste. With Casinos closed because of something called ""coronavirus"" I'm going all-in on $RBLX.

I recently discovered that Roblox garners more attention from its audience than any other platform or website online. This was shocking because I literally only watch YouTube while I'm at work. I don't even do work. So I figure if kids are doing the same with school and spending even more time than I do on YouTube playing this blox game, this company is bound to be successful. It also turns out they have $1.5 bil cash on hand. That's like ... a thousand psa 10 Charizards. Maybe more, I can't do math so Idk but it's definitely a lot.

83,m040bu,"First off, I want to say that the following post is utter nonsense. In fact, I don't recommend reading it. I may have eaten too many yellow crayons I thought were bananas this week (Or was I trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas? Idr) but I think I stumbled onto something.

Most people on this sub are Millenials (speculation). Most Millenials grew up playing video games. We have a passion for them. But we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games. *Until now*.

As we all know, Robinhood and similar apps **game-ified** investing. They made cool colors to show us how we did. It's not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on. So we could say ""Ohhhh green good red bad."" It's like the slot machine except, unlike slots, investing odds can be changed by doing work. Nobody used to do the work, but now that all the work is on the phone--the same device we have been using to play the game--it still feels like part of the game. 

So we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game. It's like when you play StarCraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at StarCraft. Well, we read posts on GME and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock. 

Why are video games even fun? None of it is real. But it's a **shared** experience that you can have with your friends and peers, or, at the very least, discuss with them. It's the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level, even though it's all fake. Well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real. Sure, it's all documented, but it's still virtual. Nobody's going to your bank and moving cash into RH's bank. This all works because we all agree that it works.

Now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even, for some of us, practicing, and you've got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing.
