I was bored and curious as to how the dot com bubble popped so I looked into it and found this way too correlated to right now

&gt;In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

So the fed hasnt came out and raised rates but mortgage companies are already raising rates and the broader repo market refusal to buy bonds are a bad sign. Smart money isnt dumb enough to buy inflation is only at 2.9% and it is showing in equities and real estate. Many analysts/fund managers have came out and said they expect repo rates to spike as high as 3% by the end of the year.


On tope of this even though its not rate hikes, they just fucking rekt any corporations paying execs over 1M and made sure to put into the stimmy 60B worth of tax hikes removing deductions for large corporations and the CNBC/Bloomberg channels havent said a fucking word even though this is kind of significant.

[Tax hikes snuck into stimulus bill](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/10/covid-relief-bill-tax-hikes-475051)

&gt;On March 13, 2000, news that Japan had once again entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.

Another china article for shits and gigs;[China stocks in correction on policy tightening, valuations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-stocks-idUKKBN2B117U)

&gt;On March 15, 2000, Yahoo! and eBay ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.

The Daq is current down 6% on the month and the S&amp;p is close to flat. Another extremely odd similarity, I mean the time frames are almost the same too not that it really matters.

&gt; On April 3, 2000, judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his conclusions of law in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001) and ruled that Microsoft was guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

I mean what the absolute fuck. The writing is seems to be on the wall. Like this is so eerily similar to what happened in 2000.

I’ve talked to a lot of hedge funds in my day, and this used to be a top holding for one of China’s best funds called Prime Capital. They sold out but wouldn’t be surprised to see them come back in, which would juice the upside even further.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

I decided to check out palantir and this is what I like:

&amp;#x200B;

1. 120 billion TAM
2. Impressive DEMO day showcasing Gotham and Foundry
3. Recent partnership with AWS 
4. great Q4 earnings and they projected the revenue will grow to 4 billion by 2025
5. they are basically in the big data business which i do not see much competition, nobody is close to what they are doing
6. stamp of approval by Cathie Wood with the given massive buying. PLTR has 1.16% weightage in their portfolio

I've taken matters into my own hands and made a simple valuation model. My goal is to get a feel for how big palantir will be in 2025 and their share price target. 

* Alex karp said projected revenue will be 4b by 2025, which is a 30% growth rate.
* I think they will confidently hit 45% compounded annual growth rate, giving them revenue of 7 billion.
* what im stuck now is applying a PS ratio. assuming PS of 20, the market cap would be 105 billion. 
* at the time of writing, PLTR market cap is 43b, so we are expecting a 2.4 x increase? i think its quite impressive but maybe a bit overhyped? maybe my valuation is totally wrong and too pessimistic.
* im still excited about PLTR but just doing my due diligence. I'm open for any criticism or feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

[a simple valuation i made](https://preview.redd.it/rvliundd7cm61.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1176eeeab29f026e2a4fdb8fa4c460c10c6319b3)

Trying to decipher today's activity through options

We can see lot of PUT buying mostly before that dump started at 12:15 EST. afternoon. Definitely few bear made good money on this bets assuming few would have closed those positions.

Funny part is most of heavy call buyers pitched in after stock has stabilized(after 3:30 PM EST) or just before close, this only indicates that it was a deliberate shakeup by market forces to flush weak hands, while make money from both ways at expense of retail trader. In coming weeks as I said earlier many times with my previous posts that this stock is going up ( Check here [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvg4q3/15_milliion_dollar_bet_on_upside_for_gme_look/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw4k8v/bullish_momentum_continues_gme_judge_yourself/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxvfjo/bullish_calls_last_hour_gme_biggest_trade_is_for/)).

In end market forces put huge bets either to cover upcoming shots or either make money on gamma squeeze/swarm.

84,m2j85w,"TL;DR- mother of god the options volume. Price is set to explode.  


So I decided to comb through the entire [options chain information](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain) provided by Nasdaq, looking at only volume. March 12th starts on page 5 if you sort only calls, all moneyness, and all types.  


Now, this looks pretty typical... only slightly elevated. But I expected  more speculation on a highly volatile stock. Then I click on page 6 and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. Hundreds of contracts at every single strike price, thousands on typical prices. And if you've been following along one depths style gaping dragon of a volume. 35,561 contracts @ 300. That represents a total of 3,556,100 shares.  


If the stock closes on Friday at $350, then those contracts print at a combined immediate loss to the market makers of 175 million dollars. That's without exercising the options, that's just the baseline loss  to buy the stock and sell it back at a loss to the investor.   


But what if the entire block of options is exercised? Well that would mean that the 3.5 million shares would need to be purchased. And if they are trading at $350 each (and through some mystic shaman bullshit the cost doesn't go up while purchasing 3.5 million shares) that would cost 1.225 billion dollars to purchase.  


But wait, there's over 22,300 contracts leading up to $350. They all print too. That's another purchase of 2,230,000 shares costing another 780 million. Again, somehow without magically increasing the price.   


Then there's 14,400 contracts @ 350. In gambling terms that strike price would be a wash. But the market makers MUST deliver those shares. Forced to purchase, that would be another 1,440,000 shares, costing another 504 million dollars.  


We total that up, and just between 300-350 strike price there are just over 7 million shares that need to be delivered on Friday.

Lets think about that for a second. If HF's sold 7 million shares today in a 20 minute window and the price of the stock only halved (followed by an immediate recovery)... What would buying 7 million shares do? Double? Price to infinity? More importantly who do they intend to buy the shares from in order to be able to deliver? Diamond hands own all the stock.  


Not a financial advisor, just a guy looking at a spreadsheet online. You should 100% not pay any attention to me.

Final note from my developmentally disabled self:  


There are (by comparison) not as many options after the 350 mark, but there are tens of thousands at each of the ""$50 increments"". But, the market makers are likely just trying to prevent a gamma squeeze to $800. Why 800? Because there are almost 44,000 contracts on 800 alone. If forced to print that would cost 3.5 billion dollars just by itself.",Why is 350 so important that the market price not be met or exceed?,1.0,1615442421,sputler

87,m2j96z,"Gather 'round and grab a tinfoil hat. I'd like to start by letting you know I'm quite retarded and this is not financial advice. That said, let me tell you why I think GameStop has 3 potential outcomes.. actually 2 since going down isn't possible because stonks only go up, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1: Laying the Groundwork**

I've read through an unhealthy amount of posts since early January invoking what I can only summarize as ape-ish behavior. Lots of laughing, crying, but most importantly tons of masturbating to gain and loss porn, which reminds me I need to find something for tonight. Any way here's what I've taken from the vast array of posts I've read through.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Short Interest -** No one really knows where the SI figure actually lies, but we can all agree it is excessive. According to the latest Finra report GameStop has a float of 54m shares and SI of 52%. I know horseshit when I smell it and fuck this stinks! Shorts losing nearly a billion dollars in one day off of low SI numbers doesn't add up (low for GME's lofty standards).

[Finra Markets GME Quote - 3\/9 Update](https://preview.redd.it/wh4vuedk9cm61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72090736c1213b6746af413db7db196566187b5c)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Current Ownership -** The GameStop saga is global and there are currently 9.5m degenerates in this sub alone. It's not hard to imagine that there are 10m people holding 5 shares out of the hundreds of millions of eyes that have been on this worldwide. That alone is the entire float. Now we need to look at institutional ownership. Institutional ownership accounts for another 200% of the float! Fintel also seems to be retarded so I finished their graph for today's close. From my understanding some of this institutional ownership does include a degree of double counts on shorts. Whether or not the short interest is captured by the institutional ownership figures doesn't matter at this point, I can't read between the lines anyway. All of the above considered let's call the total ownership 150m or 300% float.

[Fintel.io GME Institutional Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/mkfgxveo9cm61.png?width=2184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ca1bfc6fa3a6a169a3ea712f41fcd278a6001e)

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Trading History and Pushes to $400 Threshold**

&amp;#x200B;

1. On January 27th GME peaked at 380, fell to 249, and recovered closing at 347.
2. On January 28th GME roared to over 500 premarket before sharply falling, opening at 265. Then climbing again to reach a peak of 483 before unraveling during a time we'd all like to forget about while multiple brokerages deliberately and drastically removed demand from the equation.
3. Today, March 10th GME continued it's week long print sesh of endless brr steadily climbing to 348 before having it's legs cut off and falling to an intraday low of 172 and recovering to close at 265.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Connecting the Dots**

&amp;#x200B;

Ask yourself what do the 3 days above have in common? All 3 days shares of GME approached and/or hovered in the $400 threshold. All 3 days shares of GME experienced sudden and drastic losses during huge buying momentum.. fuck loss porn I'll just masturbate to today's red candle.

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm.. looks to me as if GME getting past the $400 threshold is bad news for someone, can't imagine who? So I pulled out my crayons and after connecting a few dots it dawned on me that $400 had to be the margin call threshold for enough of the total short position to ignite the **M.O.A.S.S.** simultaneously fueled by gamma squeezing. Have you guys seen the outrageous amount of open interest on the casino board?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4: Galaxy Brain \*\*\*Tinfoil Hat Required\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

It's not far fetched for the total ownership including short interest to be 3-10x the total float. This could spell possible market-wide chaos if large entities are forced to liquidate assets to cover their positions at astronomical prices as they're squeezed dry for delicious tendies. Mutual funds, endowments, 401K's and personal retirement funds, etc. possibly wiped out as their irresponsible managing firms sell off because they were too greedy, twisted, and pulled the lever so hard it got stuck down.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the Plunge Protection Team. Essentially a deep state group called on once or twice a decade to play god with our beloved stonks. Shrouded in the shadows the Plunge Protection Team could have been acting in the broader American market's best interest by correcting the price of certain securities as they reached potentially dangerous levels. Not once or twice but three times GME was a speeding bullet train that had it's track pulled out from under, keeping it from ripping past the moon or Valhalla and straight to the fucking tendie vaults. Here's an Investopedia article on the matter:  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 5: What You Impatient Fucks Have Been Waiting For**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Scenario 1 -** The size of the short position and number of naked shorts amongst other fuckery is so big a **M.O.A.S.S.** would unravel the American markets. GameStop continues to be decapitated anytime it is in or around the $400 threshold. Tomorrow GME will be on the short sale restricted list and any daft drops similar to the ones we've seen would not be the actions of very large short sales but rather divine intervention commonly referred to as **Deep State Fuckery**. Improvise, adapt, overcome. Start playing the casino board with this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Scenario 2 -** The powers that be decide 3 times is enough and they can't delay launch sequences any longer, they'll have to learn from the shady activity of large players in the market and the mistakes made. GameStop flies 4.367 light years to Alpha Centauri.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I hope to see familiar faces in Alpha Centauri. I heard it's nice this time of year.

Goldman Sachs gave a PT of $31 BEFORE the partnership with NBC’s The Profit Nascar enthusiast, Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis’s 200+ locations 24/7 service and sales leverage.  

Don’t you love how everything acquired from Lordstown is done so efficiently?  Meanwhile,

JPMORGAN gave a bearish hit piece out right AT the moment Lordstown’s stock was at the tripple top on the chart.  EXACTLY AT IT : 
They bought the dip.

Biden slipped in one of his first economic going electric announcements regarding the “retooling” loan him and Obama did to bail out auto... ... when that loan was themed around WAGEs not tooling.  
—- Just so happens, Lordstown has applied for a tooling loan, “the same kind tesla got”.. putting the project “on steroids”... Burns said.

unit economics should be ridiculous with 15000 less parts, costing less to buy &amp; own..

The hub motors is the only thing all the EV’s don’t have and IS IT not interesting how ARK invest is diamond handing Workhorse as they are the one who made the deal with Lordstown to use that technology for a percentage of the co and 1% of each endurance profit?  
I feel like if WKHS gets the bid (ya that’s still a thing actually) Lordstown might just merge with them and those 250+ patents on Drones.
done editing this rant...

The 6 CEO’s that we’re once listed on Ride’s site have since been taken off the site, are globally ready to fight the good fight and GM must have known it.. here you go let’s help set up all our equipment with you and give you a loan you already paid off for the 2nd biggest factory in the automotive industry.. 
They’re going to need more factories... aside from 2nd biggest battery plant there too.. tesla being 1st.  There’s much to the story we don’t know.
Like in Jack Spencer’s interview where Burns was talking about the 100k preorders foreshadowing it does not include municipalities, gov, Fed, police, town, state vehicle orders.. ya know the ones Biden says he’ll be replacing their vehicles with.. 
The race mid April.  (They can make the batteries go as long as they want it to) 
Safety ratings coming.
The started from the bottom now we here story line.  Pandemic born Endurance..
The Q2/Q3 van/Camping World RV prototype ... the Solar Panels powering the factory even..
The clear lane of all EV work trucks untapped.

It’s performance .. doesn’t even belong in the segment it’s going to be compared with its advantages and is 17k less.. the wheel technology can move sideways.. but no one is talking about that yet also.

Oshkosh bid has been halted. 
Good thing the Dems really hammered down postmaster during the pre vote setting the stage for what we all already knew.. no not just Workhorse, they‘re going to need to do something to make them look good.  
And Has any other EV’s visited the White House?
It’s had and always will be about the money, so don’t get political, it’s a waste of everyone’s energy and is racist.
Why is JPMORGAN bashing Lordstown and pumping Fisker and Goldman doing vise-versa?? 
Look at the Short interest on the closest 1st to Market all EV 0 emissions fleet Truck..  
Buy that dip.
“Work for it” that’ll be a fine narrative to the unemployed after getting our country highjacked on a super flu and the media is going to need to start shouting something positive after all the garbage they’ve been feeding for so long... and to be honest Steve Burn (co founder of Workhorse, CEO of Lordstown) earns it.  These are good people, in a good community, working on a worthy project, and they love what they do and work hard on doing it.  Like.. the DD you’re welcome to do, it’s all there.
