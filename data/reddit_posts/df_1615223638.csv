2.9 billion * 8.8% = ~ 255 million

What I'm seeing here is that the people that started this SPAC are fucking over everyone that bought into the SPAC by agreeing to value the shares below $10 and by agreeing to a merger where the other company maintains 86% of control over the stock. Looks like an investor scam.

5,m0kk7x,"Okay so I’m going to give it to you all straight, GameStop has been moving very nicely lately. But there is a small concern I want people to know.

Last week it peaked at roughly 185 then dropped and remained around 100-140 the whole week, still over double what it has been at (at 40).

This is not an advisement, but if you see it drop this week please don’t sell. If people haven’t noticed sometimes stocks cool off before they shoot up again. 

If you bought at 185, sold at 130 last week instead of holding, you would be down 55 bucks instead of breaking even today with what it was last week.

I’m a retard so I am not always correct, there might not be a cool off. I think it is will be very easy for GameStop to go over 250 within March.

In other words, if you own any shares keep holding you fucking apes love you all. I don’t care if you got in at 40 or 330, hold the line 💎🙌🏼. I hate seeing people sell and lose their asses cuz of a lil volatility and fear

I know most of you know this too but I keep seeing people get angry when they sell and blaming us for it. GameStop to the moon 🚀🚀just show some damn patience and don’t paper hand.

Looking at the option chain for 3/12, you can see that below 550 MMs would be forced to chase price lower as they become more and more underhedged. Below 500 shit gets exciting with 11:1 PCR and below 450 we get 200:1 PCR.

https://i.imgur.com/mEdhhaG.png

This should set off a gigantic chain reaction that will crater ARKK's portfolio and force mass liquidation across the rest of the tech names. This will most certainly feedback into SPX/NDX because of the tech heavy nature.

Not the same, but share some similar characteristics

* Both stock have been beaten down into oblivion (See comparison chart below)
* Before DFV, who the fuck invests in GME? Now, who the fuck invests in GE?
* Both stock have HIGH upside when it is consolidating at the bottom
* Both stock have special external conditions that make it an interesting R / R play
* GME was over shorted and had fresh talent take over from CHEWY
* GE is in a special moment in US history when an Infrastructure Bill by the Gov could pave the way for a turnaround for General Electric (more on that later)

# TECHNICALS

My primary reasoning for this bet is in the charts, which are self-explanatory with pretty crayon coloring. I’ve simplified it tremendously and only highlighted important stuff.

# (SPECULATIVE) FUNDAMENTALS

Aside from the technical, I’m also BETTING that the Post Pandemic era is going to send this stock back up to test previous highs.

1. Pandemic - For obvious reasons, people getting sick and dying increases demand in the entire healthcare sector.
2. Post Pandemic – Travel industry will recover, which means GE Aviation demand will rise
3. US Power grid issues – GE is the OG in this space (remember Edison General Electric Company? I don't). They laid the foundation for America’s power grid back before our great grandparents were hipsters.

`SPECULATION ON INFRASTRUCTURE BILL` –JPOW and his goons are on a printing spree. With California fires the last 6 years and Texas power grid chaos this year, it is OBVIOUS (to me) we need to UPGRADE OUR POWER GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. What better way to do that than to pump TRILLIONS into the sector through an INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, which not only addresses our power problem but generate jobs and get America back on it’s feet? This means an upgrade to our power grid to provide more reliable power when we need it the most (i.e weather extremities) with an emphasis on sustainability and being more eco friendly (Greta probably approves) . GE is poised to be the biggest player for this task as they have the capacity and experience to do the job. On a side note, if an infrastructure bill passes, it’ll be more than GE that benefits from the bill.

I am a Finance PhD student, and I found a very interesting trading system that can correctly predict stock movement around earnings announcements. I backtested the idea and it works very well. The system picks stocks with about 80% winrate.

I will be publishing my picks in this subreddit and hopefully, I can get some feedback.

For this week my system predicts that Oracle and Campbell's are going to go up. My system says that it is better to buy the stock today right before close and keep them until tomorrow before close. If the stocks go up they should be sold, but if they will not go up then it is better to keep them until the next day after the earnings announcement and sell them right before close.

I do not expect that you invest in this stock based on my first recommendation. Moreover, I do not recommend doing it. But I suggest adding my recommendation to your calendar and see what happens.

94,m0kvoj,So buying and selling shares isn't good at all since it gets you +5% on a good day and +1% on a regular day. Options tend to be a bit better but they don't do anything when it's a weekly option and it's monday/tuesday/wednesday. The only options that either get me rich or broke really fast are at thursday or friday with 0DTE options which I love. But for monday through wednesday I really need lose my money faster. Why don't brokers implement the casino function? Why don't they implement roulette? It's such a really good way of getting that money from impatient investors like me.,My broker should implement roulette and blackjack for days when I'm too impatient,1.0,1615224510,spincerss
