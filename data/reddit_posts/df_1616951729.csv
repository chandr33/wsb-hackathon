I'm the biggest window licker I know, my wife isn't home right now she's probably with her boyfriend and I'm typing this message to who fuckin knows. I dropped a months pay on gme in the middle of February and didn't budge. From what I'm seeing and learning is we have fun on other trades just to love our $GME. But would it be traded to put a months pay into $MAC? They're completely debt free, they're in the same position as $GME and the divs are dope. As I beat my head on this window, I just need a little guidance as my DD isn't as strong as yours but I feel in the guts this might be right... ü¶çü¶çü¶ç",Trying to get wrinkles,1.0,1616952117,Physics_Senior
6,mf5c1e,"$Root is a disruptive fintech in the insurance world. 

Traditional insurance uses different correlations to gauge riskiness of customers to determine pricing, with credit score being the biggest determinant but also gender, age, and make/model of the car.

$Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers. Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user's driving behavior. Every 9 months the data collected allows $Root to reiterate their pricing models. Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions.

To highlight the effectiveness of using telematics in seasoned states with just one 9 month iteration of collecting data $ROOT was able to deliver a 15% improvement in their loss ratio. That is a substantial cost savings that will grow even further overtime with each reiteration. 

Thier IPO last year during a pandemic had some of the biggest tech names including snowflake investor Dragoneer at an IPO price of $27. 

During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37%. Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics. Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models. Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models. $Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies.

Bear Arguments.
Insurance is a nongrowth mature industry with big players to compete against. 
Covid-19- less people driving and nobody knows how driving behavior will be in the future with wfh.
Shorts are also not understanding the potential tech with telematics and how it could revolutionize insurance with fairer pricing and lead to SaaS to those who use driving info.


Short Squeeze Potential
Currently a lot of the shares outstanding are locked up until 4/26. 13 million float. 68-74% short interest.

Gamma Squeeze Potential.
Call Volume was over 50,000 on Friday for 4/16

Catalyst for short squeeze and potential price targets.
There is a lot of DD on here. If you type Root in the search bar and DD multiple posts come up in the past two months. Citron Research posted on Twitter Friday the potential for a short squeeze. Volume on Friday with citron posts was 3.5x the average.. This is really a wsb thing and looking at the DD on here it might be possible citron stole the idea from here. 

The insurance industry although mature is huge and Root could offer SaaS in the future to major insurance carriers. Most of the shorts probably entered at the 22 mark, the gamma ramp goes up to 40, I could see this from a short squeeze with the low float and the twitter pump going to 60+ by 4/16.

Positions: 2,000 shares 10 10c 4/16 10 7.5c 4/16 adding more tomorrow thinking 20c. 

Further readings: there's tons of DD on here if you look in the search bar. Also if you look up citron research on Twitter. Idk I think he stole the idea from us. Tendies should be ours.",$Root why I like this stock.,1.0,1616952152,darksoulmakehappy

Yes everyone knows and everyone agrees you should back up your data frequently.

I did at least most of it.. This morning my desk top kind a died and I had to restore it.

Wasn't able to keep the data cause it was F-------d up.

So clean install and I am back!!!

Thanks to a external hard drive that has most of my data including login pass and links.

&amp;#x200B;

So If you do not have a recent back up ..

You might consider to make one and also a back up schedule so that in case of SHTF you still have your data.

There is some fundamental analysis that could be discussed but I wanted to see what people thought about these points or any points I am missing for either case.

&amp;#x200B;

In the bullish case:

\- Sports equipment: More demand in the spring to summer as people gather together more.

\- Guns and Ammo (Not to be politically spicy): ammo is scarce and they keep selling out

\- Existing Rising Revenue

\- 48% short interest on the float (compared to 44.6% on float for GME) as of March 15th

\- Lol people love to spend stimulus on hobbies

&amp;#x200B;

In the bearish case:

\- Recent shootings could spook current investors with low sales after potential gun reform

\- Other online or retail competitors

\- Low volume can create massive price swings; may not have attention for a long time

\- Sports and leisure may not be priority with unemployment and inflation

&amp;#x200B;

We're gonna make this uncharacteristically me and go short and sweet but all the links so you can read more as you want.

[TL;DR After 25 years making the series, Brent Maddock, Nancy Roberts, Ron Underwood and S.S. Wilson were kicked out so Universal Studios could make more money off the merchandising before the Tremors copyright expires in 2025.](https://stampede-entertainment.com/site/fan-extras/tremors-faq/?include_category=miscellaneous)

Soooooo, [ever since I sidetracked a post about David Fincher's Queen Biopic with Sacha Baron Cohen as Freddie Mercury, I've done some more research.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/llwbpb/david_fincher_says_sacha_baron_cohen_looked/)

[Michael Gross didn't want it and Universal even killed off any ambiguity that he fought for.](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/tremors-shrieker-island-michael-gross-on-burt-gummer-death/) That's after he planned for [Travis Bertram Welker to come back]( https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/michael-gross-comments-on-jamie-kennedys-tremors-7-absence) and [Jamie Kennedy tried to but they wouldn't let him.](https://mobile.twitter.com/JamieKennedy/status/1188981479973347329) After 7 movies and a TV show, nothing more than a spit in the face for the man who carried a franchise. 

Same with the original creators. Did you know they were working on Tremors for 25 years and [even had the 5th one written, ""Thunder/Gummer Down Under"",](https://monsterlegacy.net/2017/06/13/subterranean-terror-tremors-5-bloodlines/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) and sat on it for 10 years before [Universal eventually told them to eat dirt?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tremors/comments/ly4sos/universal_hates_tremors/) For no reason. Well not exactly....

[Universal wants](https://imgur.com/HL4WLGz.jpg) the [merchandising money](https://imgur.com/dh0WbK2.jpg) that would come from Tremors. Don't believe me? [See Universal pull some Hollywood Accounting with Tremors already.](http://imgur.com/gallery/mFNIHV3) Half a billion dollars... completely untraceable. I've tried. Emailed the numbers people and they can't tell me anything unless you pay $50 a film to see the numbers. Which makes me ask, who paid for the numbers on 1,5, 6, &amp; 7? And why only what they made? Not their cost. Same for the numbers on 2, 3, &amp; 4. Why numbers on the cost, but nothing on what it made? 

Then when you find out that [the copyright to Tremors will revert to its creators](https://imgur.com/ldMfTiY.jpg) after the [35 year mark,](https://imgur.com/9VBCgLj.jpg) which makes that date 2024-2025 (since Tremors was filmed in '88-'89 but released in '90).... [wellllll](https://imgur.com/AzzfOx3.jpg) some things start [to add up.](https://imgur.com/MyAjHxe.jpg)

Like did you know you can't find ANY official Tremors merch? But you CAN find tons of fan-made creations. Give it a Google. Nada. [They don't even list Tremors on the Universal website](https://www.universalpictures.com/about) even with a [longer history, more money made, and amount of sequel potential in comparison.](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZnXEsI3)

[Hell, you could watch the TV show for free on the NBC site but the episodes were so jumbled it would ruin people's enjoyment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tremors/comments/m0wvwu/tremors_episode_9_graboid_rights_is_back_on_nbc/)

What about how they made a Tremors series pilot with Kevin Bacon that Universal/NBC/SyFy has proceeded to [hide deeper than a Graboid burrows](https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/tremors-star-kevin-bacon-confused-sequel-series-picked/) despite [no one knowing why.](https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/tremors-part-1) Read the script for yourself if you don't believe me. [They've already hidden it for two years.](https://imgur.com/gallery/UbtTvyf) 

Same as the original script for Tremors 2: Aftershocks. The creators have wanted it seen for 20 years but it took a crazy Larry like me to get it out there. [It's got Val, Earl, Burt and Heather in it too.](http://imgur.com/gallery/8QaHPRy) 

All these things swirl together and make me wonder more and more. For the plethora of Tremors fandom goes deeper than even me...

Like Imgur user @BabyFarkMcGeeZax. [They created Burt Gummer Day five years ago through sweat and love alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tremors/comments/mb2rtz/babyfarkmcgeezax_created_burt_gummer_day_and/) yet what does Universal do? Take the day, plaster it over the end of their hero's death, and not even give a line credit to @BabyFarkMcGeeZax or a mention on Twitter as they blurb it everywhere. 

[Ever seen the gif battles](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifTournament/comments/luvt39/giftournament_battle_13_round_3/) [about Tremors at r/HighQualityGifs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/dtz11k/battle_178_tremors/)

[How about the Everything Sequel Podcast where they discuss how amazing all of The¬†Tremors Saga is after discovering it for the first time?](https://share.transistor.fm/s/6b6572f9)

If you think I'm crazy too, just see and know how I've been in this position before. [I'm well aware of how this ""story"" plays out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ex5szm/fast_furious_two_years_ago_i_called_hans/)

[So let's make Tremors 8: Ouroboros with the OG creators back on board.](http://imgur.com/gallery/o2kCFLu) Then we restart the TV show and end the movies. Just like The Librarians. If Marvel can switch between movies and TV, Tremors can too. 

After all this time, and all this love, and all this greed, it's time we break Hollywood tradition and give power back to the people.
