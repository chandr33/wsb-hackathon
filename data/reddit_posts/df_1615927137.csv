&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS INSANE. Let me highlight the above. If you buy a share today, there's a 50% chance the share you end up with has been sold short. Not only that, it's VERY OBVIOUS this is happening. One way we know this is true is an increase in Failure to Deliver (FTD). Check out this graph provided by THE SEC ITSELF.

[Failures to Deliver for TRIT \(https:\/\/sec.report\/fails.php?tc=TRIT \)](https://preview.redd.it/1l9jxq3vpfn61.png?width=1614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dacdfa81928d6ff846f1361417a77c1f480ecc7e)

Not only that - a ton of shorted shares were sold at the bottom (Shares traded at $6.84/share on close at the arrow). Shorts could not have picked a worse time and are already underwater.

[A majority of short shares were sold at the bottom \(data from https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/TRIT \)](https://preview.redd.it/qp8ceq7lnfn61.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=823acc6c02670a04bb909d89ff19dc8697cf8301)

If that wasn't enough, check out the interest shorts are currently paying A LOT for the privilege of getting fucked in the ass. **The current borrow rate is OVER 30%!!**

[TRIT borrow rate \&gt;30&amp;#37; \(https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/TRIT\) ](https://preview.redd.it/jpmlc1vhqfn61.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a59afc261c8ba9b0d990362ecaf09df07c74add)

NASDAQ reported volume for the stock has been dropping like a rock as more shares are being bought and held. [Looking at historic volume](https://nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/trit/short-interest), ADV has gone from almost 8M/day to 2.7M in less than a month. If you look at the past week in trading, this number has gone down even further (even less than 1M for some days). The longer shorts hold off on buying back shares the worse it will be as there won't be enough volume for them to buy back. 

# Company Background:

Triterras owns a platform that brokers deals for trade financing. They are trying to make it easy and transparent to get financing in an area that is getting continually more complex. I think they're doing an ok job and it seems that they are continually improving the platform and working to get more customers to achieve network affect. Additionally, they're one of the only fintechs that have turned a profit since inception. But I digress - I don't really give a shit about the company. 

You might be wondering how they got into this position.  Phase 2 Partners released an absolutely GARBAGE short report on the company. How do I know it's shitty? A bunch of ambulance-chasing law firms tried to get class action suits together. None are proceeding that I'm aware and I've seen multiple suit announcements ""withdrawn"". I also read the report and most of items are ""the CEO is doing business with his former acquaintances"" - like that's not a common thing that happens.

87,m6jh5g,"Team RKT reporting in. We were humming along this week quite nicely with all signs pointing to a strong gamma ramp that would push the price well beyond $30, cause massive buying and likely push even higher than last time. 

However, a hedge fund(Melvin, is that you?) or other big player with heavy puts or sold calls against RKT didn't want that to happen.

This afternoon there was a 400k share (~$10M) short bet. That likely trigged stop limits and de-hedging by market makers causing the price to drop even further. It was timed during low volume for maximum effect(wiping out the bid side). It was meant to control the price. There was also heavy put activity today holding it back(possibly by the same entity). Shorts are trying to take back control before the 03/19 expiry happens.

The 03/19 expiry has huge open interest, especially at the $28.89 level. If Rocket had continued the 3% daily from Monday, we'd have hit $28.99 on Friday(and likely sooner as the gamma ramp kicked in). This short bet today was pure manipulation. Timed for maximum effect to ensure RKT doesn't have time to recover before Friday.

The gamma squeeze is still possible, but not without heavy retail buy-in. If RKT breaks $27 for a sustained time period with the $25.89 and $26.89 open interest going in the money, breaking the $29 barrier that would kick-off a gamma squeeze becomes a real possibility.

I truly believe RKT is worth far more than it's trading at. I like this stock.
