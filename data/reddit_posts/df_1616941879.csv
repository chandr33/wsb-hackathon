- Not trying to draw attention away from GME right before take off. Pos: 200 @ $80 avg 🚀🚀 and 💎✋
- I realize that not every play or high short interest is a squeeze...

But serious question:

- Biden will be proposing an infrastructure plan next Wednesday, March 31 and there seems to be speculation that a significant portion of the 3 to 4 trillion dollar plan will be devoted to clean energy initiatives, including the electrical grid, charging stations etc. I realize this could take months if not longer to pass and the final results could be quite different but could this create some potential for companies like BLNK?

- BLNK exhibits conditions that are similar to GME in the sense that short interest is quite high (Short % of Float is 37.99% as of March 15) and the float is relatively low 30.87 M. Again, I realize it is not the same situation as GME as there may be other variables at play but just curious as to  any opinions and thoughts on this?

&amp;#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&amp;#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.  


**Analysis:**

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",Coursera: A DD Introduction,0.67,1616943865,babablacksheep904

62,mf2t5a,"Blackberry as a third-party software provider has the best shot at building an industry-standard vehicle software platform because they do not compete directly with the automakers. 

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS or Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will hopefully become the industry-standard vehicle data platform.",Blackberry QNX + IVY might be the next Android + Google Mobile Services,0.67,1616944762,Character-Cup-2263

72,mf30uw,"BLUF: Both of these stocks are knee deep in the streaming wars. They both fell sharply last week due to a hedge fund liquidation. Read more about that in the link below. Over the past 5 days, DISCA fell 46%, and VIAC fell 51%. Both have a bullish sentiment, along with their pros and cons.

&gt;[ViacomCBS, Discovery plunge due in part to forced liquidation of Archegos Capital positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html)

Below is a 3 month snapshot of both stocks, along with SPY just for comparison purposes.

[3 Month view of VIAC, DISCA, and SPY](https://preview.redd.it/8qhzft9xesp61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4e655fb4a233038e41f0122327e3f763f9a3601)

Both VIAC and DISCA followed each other rather closely in terms of percentage gained. Even with the recent drop, had the stock been held, both would come out beating the market.

**Profile Overview:**

[VIAC is approx. 18&amp;#37; larger than DISCA.](https://preview.redd.it/u0xhj70yesp61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5124890c20f75a651950f10fd820578eb93f8c50)

**Profitability:**

https://preview.redd.it/dmmkpgy3fsp61.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a735ab5a2608ec4ba38c11429c06cd2d3e8cb47

DISCA comes out ahead here. They both have a rather decent profit margin, but DISCA has a whopping 24% advantage over VIAC.

**Momentum:**

https://preview.redd.it/lm5e6jq4fsp61.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e245da1875ed75731ddc6fed5d8a64aae9a3b25

Let's skip over the 1 month price performance, as this has been explained via the first link provided at the top.

DISCA comes out ahead in the less than 6 months, and the greater than 1 year price performance. Meanwhile, VIAC is the clear winner in the 9 month to 1 year price performance. Overall, both performed well recently, but DISCA has been consistently in the green.

**Income Statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/638r7ng5fsp61.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67ae40ae70845b7ba971bdc1c6699017eb8684d

VIAC's revenue is the clear winner here. They pull in more than double DISCA's revenue. They also come out ahead in every other faucet.

**Balance Sheet:**

https://preview.redd.it/t17gusa6fsp61.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c86a682e7a11bf08a3500f886aec5a323cc8c36b

Now, their balance sheets. Both have a nice chunk of cash on hand, which should give investors confidence. VIAC does hold more debt, however, they also recently announced that they are going to issue more shares, which should give them a boost of approx. $3B. DISCA, as of writing this and to my knowledge, has not released any statement concerning the issuance of more shares.

**Short Interest:**

[VIAC Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/2sdrhb27fsp61.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ac8eac76c2537f90575b9a6719148d29550f919)

[VIAC Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/) \- VIAC, as of 15 March, has 18.9%, a decrease of .5% since February 26th.

[DISCA Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/) \- DISCA, as of 15 March, has 29.7%, an increase of .6% since February 26th.

Overall, both of these companies have provided growth to their investors, even after the drastically sharp decline. With the recent decline of the NASDAQ over the past month, it's a bit of a toss-up on which one will be better in the long-term (imo that is.)

84,mf39ss,"Currently, any modern vehicle on the road already has a lot of sensors and cameras that are generating tonnes of data. The automakers have had no means to extract value from that data until the advent of Blackberry IVY. 

Unlike Tesla, most automakers are not technology companies located in Silicon Valley with access to an abundance of software talents to build the software infrastructure to fully make use of all that data (like training a self driving system). While in Silicon Valley/China, there are lots of high-tech self-driving software companies lacking access to real-world driving data because they are not an automotive company, unlike Tesla.

On one side, we have a huge supply of vehicle sensor data. On the other, we have a huge demand for vehicle sensor data. So, what's missing?

This is where Blackberry IVY + AWS comes in as the interface and marketplace between automotive and tech industries. This is not easy to do as it requires defining an industry-standard data abstraction layer that both sides agree on and ironing out all the inconsistencies across a wide variety of vehicle platforms, sensor suites, RTOS-es, ECU, Domain controllers etc. I think Blackberry has also built out the APIs, analytics tools and cloud infrastructure that help automakers store and share data to software developers.

To extract value from the vehicle data the traditional automakers own, the easiest way is to just pay Blackberry to use IVY. The immediate application can be to collect and sell vehicle sensor data to self-driving car companies. But as IVY opens up this gold mine of vehicle Big Data to software developers, there will definitely be more innovative software products that use vehicle sensor and localization data in creative ways that we have never imagined before. Kinda like how smartphones enabled new kinds of applications with interesting business models that were unheard of like Uber/Lyft, AirBnB, Instagram, TikTok, mobile games,  mobile payment etc. 

Blackberry just announced a $50 million IVY innovation fund with AWS throwing in $100k AWS credits for each participant through AWS Activate. They are serious about building a vehicle data-driven app ecosystem that will be a HUGE industry by itself in the future.",The vehicle data marketplace that Blackberry IVY + AWS enables will be HUGE,1.0,1616946144,Character-Cup-2263

99,mf3jc9,"Hello apes, quick question that has been bugging me. So as I understand it the shorts have to buy x number of shares at some point to cover their position. What is stopping them from buying it back slowly let’s say at price points of 150, 160, 170, 180, and 190, and then selling those shares at 200 thereby making money and getting out of their short position? And then just repeating for weeks and weeks until they are completely out of their short position.",Short position.,1.0,1616946951,Xx_Bundy_xX
