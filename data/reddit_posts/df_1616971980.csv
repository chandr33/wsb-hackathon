**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&amp;D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20*** 

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions. 

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health &amp; Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor &amp; Fragrance. Within Health &amp; Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor &amp; Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages

$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

[John Doerr Ownership \/ Other Investments](https://preview.redd.it/zq3bts856up61.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ac19937f3e728e1761e8b26a513ce6b35f0138)

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more

47,mfcz79,"So, imagine you are the world. The Suez Canal is your asshole. This ship the Ever Given is the 4th largest dildo man kind has ever created.  This dildo is now in your asshole. You’ve been eating lots of tendies recently and you need to take an epic shit.  If you don’t do something about this Empire State Building size dildo in your ass you might have problems.

1. The media story of a gust of wind is a factor but something f'd up big. 

2. Ship was going 13 knots, when usually ships go around 8 knots. Whatever happened, happened quick and hard.

3. Look at the red paint at the bottom of the ship at the bow- that should be underwater. Just think about how much weight just was raised by about a one story house. There are 20,000 of those big containers on the ship. 

4. Let’s talk about tides, for the apes who live in trees.  This planet we live on has “tides”, because it spins commonly called day and night. Tides are caused by the moon. The moon is one out of two really big things we see in the sky. It’s also where rocket ships live. 

Everyday the tide goes up and down, twice to be exact. but if you look day to day, high tides get higher, then peak, then come back down again, just like your bank account. The peak happens on March 31 and again two weeks later.  This peak is also special( but not like you), it’s called a neap tide. The water level will be the highest it will be until April 25th. The 31st is the best chance of getting her off. (That’s what she said)

https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest

5. Potential for an even bigger fuck up is not unthinkable.  To build these huge ships they make them just able the handle rough seas. Since the ship is aground front and back though they are going to need to pull one or both ends out kinda sideways. It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.  

So, you’ve eaten at Taco Bell, you understand.  This is a problem, you are starting to sweat, but it’s not a disaster yet. How do we fix this ass problem: Dig her out, pull her out, or float her.

I think we’ve all seen that poor crane, one bulldozer and 4 dudes trying their best, but something tells me this might not be the answer.  It can help, and what I hope happens is that dredging can help, but I know nothing on the topic.

Some basic maths: let’s say one third of the ship is aground. The Least Fucks Ever Given weighs about 200,000 metric tons.  This is a friction problem.  You need 50% of the weight that is aground to pull her off, that’s around 30,000 tons of force. Another ship, the Far Samson, is the most powerful tug boat in the world and can pull 420(woot woot) tons.   You would need more than 15 of these but there is only one. 

Siapem 3000 to the rescue?  Another way to fix this is to make the ship lighter, they are already doing this, ballast is being removed and fuel is being taken out, but the best way to make her float is to take off the containers.  This is not easy to do, because the ship is so tall. There are only a few crane ships that can off load containers 40 meters up.  One of these the Saipem 3000 is in the Red Sea and in transit. Shout out: u/parsimonyBase

So Saipem 3000, I hope you get the Ever Given so high that you literally save the global economy. 

Cheers to all of those working the problem! Thanks to all the merchant sailors out there, you are our only hope!

P.S. hope you are having a good day!",Suez Newbie DD #2,1.0,1616975004,NaticusN

Stay up all night jackin it? I already do that.

But the thought of not having to deal with going to work and choosing how I spend my time it extremely interesting to me.

But I just want to have options. 

Did I spend the night partying too hard? No problem, I can spend the day recovering without having to get approval from anyone.

I also want to help my family get the things they deserve AND watch them enjoy it.
