0,m6p8fl,"Some pairings are as logical as they are inevitable. Shares of Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH) are moving sharply higher after the company announced plans to pursue a partnership with Flow Payments that will ultimately lead to a delivery and payment solution for cannabis dispensaries in a compliant marketplace.

It's perfect when you think about it. Waitr -- through its namesake platform and its Bite Squad delivery platform -- is already serving more than 700 rural and underserved cities with online ordering and takeout delivery solutions. Why not just have the same fleet of drivers also deliver legalized marijuana where federal and state directives make it available? You turn to Waitr for your food. You order cannabis. You may very well be hungry again, so you order more food through Waitr Holdings.

There's a good chance that you have never heard of Waitr Holdings. When it comes to the third-party delivery apps for restaurants (and in some cases, grocery stores), you probably think of recent IPO DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). Uber (NYSE:UBER) with its Uber Eats platform and its acquisition of Postmates is the other leading player in this space.

DoorDash commands a nearly $50 billion market cap. Uber is roughly twice as large in terms of market valuation, but its biggest contributor is its flagship personal mobility service. Waitr Holdings is a much smaller player, with a market cap of just $330 million as of Thursday's close.",Is Waitr Holdings the Next Hot Cannabis Stock?,1.0,1615945893,thalobby

Ofc, I’m a newbie and that’s why I need your help. Yes I invested my money in GME and I have a small percentage of a stock of it. But I want to learn more about investing. Like how to do my own research and how to read the graphs and look for patterns or how to spot a squeeze before it occurs or make predictions on set growth of the stock.

The thing is I’m a very fast learner, I get told that so much that it’s annoying. All it takes is to just give me one little push and I’ll take off to the moon. Whether you believe, idc. But, right now I need a basic foundation of investing, that’s all I need. I don’t need any advice on which stocks to buy Bc of what research you done. I want to learn to do it by myself so I can invest more in GME.

First and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips. I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.

Have you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.

Think about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?

The little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair ""stock"" market and that anyone can become rich.

I'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.

The thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.

But seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?

Hint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING

No matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.

**Next my fellow retards,**

HDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.

No time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever 🙌🙌🙌

Remember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.

My blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.

I can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.

TO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO. GAMESTOP WILL BE THERE.

70,m6pso5,"So I see a lot of people citing the fact that institutional ownership is currently over 100%. I’m just a retard but I know some stuff, and not all of it is banana related.

Any stock ownership over 100% indicates that the stock is being shorted heavily. That is because fake shares were somewhat created and sold by a short seller to another buyer. Now both the original owner and the new buyer of the stock can claim ownership of the same shares, which effectively doubled the amount of shares being held.

For example, I buy 1 GME share. Melvin Capital borrows my one share to short sell and sells it to my friend Bob. Now both Bob and I can claim that we each own one share when in fact one of those shares is fake.

If I remember correctly the current institutional ownership of GME is 118% and the estimated retail ownership sits around 30%+. This means lots of fake shares exist.

All of this being said, I have no idea what this means for anyone who is holding a fake share if the short position closes. In theory for the overall ownership of the stock to drop below 100% and become a realistic number again, shorts have to cover and return their borrowed shares. There have been plenty of failures to deliver lately but no one seems to be doing anything about it.

My guess is that while short sellers have not increased their positions, that have been diamond handing their short shares, going as far as borrowing money to continue paying the hefty interest rates (a brokerage likely would not margin call a short seller to buy back the position if they can keep coming up with interest money). At this point it seems as if the only way for this to be over is if one side folds and closes its position. Whether the short sellers fold and buy their shorts first or the retail investors sell their shares is to be seen.

More specifically, this sub has turned into a literal zoo for all you smooth brained apes and I feel there is a strong and common sentiment shared where you all feel as if it’s “retail traders uniting to take down Melvin et al., and exposing market manipulation”. 

The reality is, there are a lot of fake actors among you smooth brained apes spreading misinformation, confirmation bias, false hope, one sided views &amp; opinions, and down playing what’s really happening with GME on a day to day basis.

Heck, I’ve just seen a post where someone tried to use the Elliot Wave Theory to time the squeeze. I’ve seen another post today where so called “veteran diamond hands” are telling everyone this is a war and to not be a paper handed bitch.

96,m6q1v9,"Note: dd below I wrote to some buddies pre-ER on the 9th or so.

Appeal to authority: I bought up $GME from $15 to $3.50ish all while the world told me I was an idiot. I put 60% of my net worth into it. I turned that $200k into &gt;$2m selling on my 32nd bday, the day before trade halts. 
Similar with $bbby at $12 and $8 (she has $80 in her!).
Other 2-4xers but I'll mention my biggest loss, $tlrd. Scumbag management sold-out the company to get their options put on easy street.
I say this to say, I know ugly. I LOVE ugly. Ugly is what made me wealthy and its where the market is wrong. 

Dd:

Not a right now thing, it's been a buy for like 1.5 years. I see this as potentially the last chance to get in though.  Earnings come on the 11th. Maybe earnings are bad (idk), that could intro a dip for a few days worth buying on.  But otherwise all the catalysts are aligned to go up.

As a refresh on what those are, they have $3b in hotel real estate but $1.1b in debt.  They are selling $1b in real estate to remove all debt (maybe buybacks follow), but that leaves you with $2b in realestate at a $0 ev. Or in other words $500m market cap should revaluation to the $2b in assets (eventually), i.e. 3-4x. Alternate valuation would be $100-150m normalized ebitda from the remaining assets at a p/e of 15 = $1.5-$2b market cap equating to the same.

How we got here?
Spinoffs result in forced selling which started the thing, then covid murdered hotels and dividend had to be killed which forces more selling.

They realized hotel sales would resolve this right before covid but covid killed the underlying businesses and the ability for buyers to finance, so the catalyst is effectively hidden while still active. I believe that the last quarter risk is back on and financing became available as hotel transactions (selling the buildings) came back. So even though hotel stays suck (Google trends) they may have liquidated about $135m in hotels. If they can't hide that with accounting, it might explode.   If they can hide it, last buy opportunity.

Now that covid has a clear end in sight, it should be a fast recover of the business, finance, and transactions that will all pull this up.  While interest rates scare the overall market and would seem to contribute to this, it's relatively a non event that provides temporary cover.

It's my only sizable position and currently sits just south of 25% of portfolio.

Update on dd from ER:
""Don't risk money you need for money that you have and need"" or something like that. It means that I earned my freedom this year and now my most concentrated position can no longer be 60% of my portfolio in its accumulation phase... so 25% position now is a big deal.

Reason I didn't go over 25% is that covid effect on hotel transactions was unknown.  I could predict consumer use / demand for them but not the buying and selling of hotels. Given somewhat tight liquidity for the company and loan covenants that have potential for hot water, I couldn't risk more than 25% despite whatever valuations tell me as far as upside.

ER revealed great news though. Hotel disposals did $48m is offloading in q4 and stated another $38m occurred in jan/Feb period. An additional $185m is under contract for completion through q3. That's $271M in viable debt reduction. I expect sales to pick up greatly from here and we could see that 2021 number approach $500m by the end. 


As a repeat, take $1.2b EV ($700m debt), with book value of real estate at $2.6/7b. Sell assets on about $700m 'noncore' remaining. Ev changes to $500m on 1.9/2b book. Either market cap relates to those more attractive assets or covid conclusion resurfaces the $150m ebitda/yr value on that $500m market cap and valuation relates on FFO (cashflows). Either way it's a very secure and safe 2-3x in my book and worth of substantial concentration.
