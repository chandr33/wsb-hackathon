**The cash raise will give Aurora “maximum flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives, which may include acquisitions or partnerships pursuant to the company’s previously stated global growth strategy,” Aurora said in a news release issued Wednesday.** 

Let's start piecing some things together. Aurora has drastically reduced their cash burn, they have right sized production and trimmed the run rates. They have raised over 500M on the books, Aurora Sun is now up for sale, 1B self prospectus, not yet announced US brand extension ""KG7"" 

IMO we have a big fish ready to partner with us. A US pharmaceutical/medical company like Pfizer. Financially we are no longer a liability, and we are asset heavy. But what do i know, I'm just a dumb diamond handed ape holding until we hit $100

Fast forward to 2020, I spent quarantine learning how to invest, because I'm actual dumb ape, and got introduced to this community around xmas by a coworker. All I want at this point in life is to stick it to the hedge fund manipulators who have been partially responsible for, not just mine, but a lot of people's hard times over the years. And the fact that I see the real possibility to be a part of that and potentially be able to provide a better life for my tiny apes is a beautiful karma dream. I see so much potential in this community and wish you all the best. Some of you stand to become millionaires or even billionaires which is truly awesome.
