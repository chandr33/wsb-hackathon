CTXR is working on a cure or a way to help people who have problems after covid, I read a few posts who thought this products was somthing that people use during covid, its not, its to treat long term ill people, Millions (Like 117 million) of people have had covid, Around 76% have symbtom after for atleast 6 months and alot of those have problems for life , problems like respiratory conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

"" New research has found that 76 percent of people who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 experienced at least one lingering symptom 6 months after recovering.

Am betting this treament will be fast tracked. This product will be a cash cow for the company for a very long time once its out...This + Mino-Lok will launch the stock price to all new highs over the next year

58,m5r7im,"As most of you can probably see, GME and AMC have VERY low borrow fee rates on iborrowdesk. I called TDAmeritrade this morning and their rates were the same as iborrowdesk, so we can assume that they are correct. 

when a stock is heavily shorted, the borrow fee rate is sky-high (as GME was in January) because it is more difficult to borrow (high demand, low supply). A low borrow fee rate implies that short interest is very low. However, as we all know, GME's short interest is high. There are various DDs saying that the short interest is over 100%. At the very least, we can assume that it's at least 50% (from FINRA report). 50% is still sky-high short interest, which makes me wonder why the borrow fee is so low. If brokerages thought that GME was grossly overvalued and would soon drop, the borrow fee should be higher. Maybe the brokerages, because they have more data than us, can easily see the short squeeze coming, so they are allowing lower fees because they don't think the stock will go down. So I'm wondering what do people think about the borrow fee rate considering short interest is so high. The same goes for AMC as well.",Borrow fee rates for GME,1.0,1615832554,HomeDepotHank69
