27,lx5epa,"Hopefully you made money from the weed stock bump last month and RKT this week. The following is ASO DD and why it could take GME to the next level based on reinvesting gains. Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO) beat last quarters earnings by 2.X times predictions. My thesis involves a run up to the Q4 earnings report March 31. Besides the company consistently outperforming market expectations it currently sits as the third most shorted stock (under GME and Tanger).

Since the pandemic began gun and ammo sales have been going through the roof. You may think this would be a negative factor going forward as things calm down but January 2021 had the 3rd highest gun sales record in history. Ammo stocks have seen a boost but then a drop as they report they cannot keep up with supply.

Hunting, fishing, camping, kayaking and other outdoor hobbies have seen a huge increase since the pandemic began, this shit ain't over fokes and we know how much autists spend on new hobbies.

Texas is ""opening back up"" and eliminating the mask mandate. Texas has almost 10% of the US population and they love guns, ammo and the outdoors. ASO is going to be absolutely packed. On top of that, they're all about to receive that sweet stimey money and it sure isn't going into investments. This will undoubtably create positive sentiment articles. 

So this all sounds like a long term bull case right? Wrong. ASO has seen huge spikes in 2021, as have most of the most heavily shorted stocks. This one has the financials and positive momentum to keep it going. If it garners enough interest, as RKT did, a pop is bound to happen as people see the value.

How does this affect GME? Have you seen the posts of people reinvesting gains from RKT and weed stocks? This is the next stop on the road to the moon. P.S. I'm drunk on tendies so excuse misspellings, grammar and lack of charts.",DD: ASO 🚀🚀🚀GME fuel,0.8,1614808582,USAG1748

That being said, the general hype around UWMC has got my balls tingling. I paper handed out of GME when it dipped to 50 and lost a cool £600 (newb), but bought back in and now looking to fuel the tendies from RKT and UWMC. Looks like it’s a great hold short/mid/long term. What are peoples thoughts?

Oh and before any mouth breathers comment saying I’m a shill from a hedgie, meet me on the moon for a fist fight you cucks.

71,lx5kkw,"\[*Started as a comment but I think it's worth a wider read if it doesn't end up buried or deleted. Thanks to those who responded positively there.*\] 

Since I'm in the mood to cultivate downvotes, I figured I would toss out a bit of cold water to soak up all the salt:

Monday I watched some guy get absolutely reamed for selling his $17 positions at $170 because he was ""betraying the cause."" Because stonk holding is supposed to be about fucking over the hedgies. I'm for this. No one should get to fuck over 300 million people without getting their turn over the barrel.

But you know what fucks over hedgies *more*?? Not being in debt. A $200k payday to someone who's never had more than $15k in their savings account means no more car loan at 9%. No more mortgage at 2-4%. No more un-bankruptable college debt.

Not having underwater loans to boost A/R assets means less financing for hedge funds that trade in credit securities.

It also means more cash in that person's pocket, every single paycheck, to spend, invest, or save. Money that - instead of going into the black hole of credit management - will be used to make that person's life better and (hopefully) build generational wealth that makes them less susceptible to the whims of billionaires.

So, hate if you want, hold if you want, or sell if it will make your life better to do so. Don't ever live in pain because of peer pressure or FOMO.

You may proceed with your ""sir, this is a gamblers anonymous meeting"" shitposts. I'll see you on the other side of the noise.",Money should make your life better. The power of signal-to-noise.,0.93,1614809048,killians1978
