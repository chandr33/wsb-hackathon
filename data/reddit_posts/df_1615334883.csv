46,m1kjtv,"Hello fellow Apes.

Got here late. @290, but falling. Didn't care. I heard that if I hold, two Hedge Funds would fall. And I bought more @105. I'm nearly broke and God knows I barely though to sell when it hit 40€. But I am so broke that couldn't buy that dip. Had to buy noodles to eat, but I still hold. Because I heard that it's not a loss if you don't sell.

Now I'm posting my first post. Thinking in Spanish and writing in English. Pure Ape. Sorry if I kept you busy from seeing your wife mating with her boyfriend. But here is my sincere question:

If the stock I really like hits 800 then 1200... Then entire USA market would fall. I would love to see that because of the Hedgefunds, but if you know how this works, we all know that it would affect mostly to the lower class people. And I don't want that. So I would prefer to the USA market not to collapse.

But I want the Hedgefunds to bleed. So I would not sell till 800, but if the market is cracking at 1200$ share. I'll sell at 1069,42. Not for the profit, for the workers.

And what If this goes back again? Can anyone explain me at that point, how much money the Hedgefunds would loose if I hold forever?

You read so far wow.
You are so desperate. 
I love you

49,m1kk6w,"I know this is more of a boomer play but hear me out on this one. As everyone is well aware, the market has been a wild ride for the past couple weeks, with tech being crushed while ""re-opening"" and other value plays have mostly performed well. We've seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those. 

KO is trading at just under $51 as of today's close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.

With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings. 

Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:

[https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT\_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208\_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D](https://equisolve-private.s3.amazonaws.com/cocacolacompany/db/764/7664/file/CORRECTED%20TRANSCRIPT_%20The%20Coca-Cola%20Co.%28KO-US%29%2C%20Q4%202020%20Earnings%20Call%2C%2010-February-2021%208_30%20AM%20ET.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVOH5SHIJOSUYOLRZ&amp;Expires=1615332187&amp;Signature=oPMiBI1hM9jbiC2m%2FNpNed8vwfU%3D)

Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called ""reopening plays,"" I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I'm not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I'm just surprised that more people don't seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There's a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning. 

With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (\~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I've been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.

I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I'm not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I'm obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank  50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I'd hate to miss out on those gains.

Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

76,m1kngy,"5 days ago I posted DD on Academy Sports, where I believe that its earnings report this month will be a catalyst for a short squeeze. I didn't post this DD as an experiment in manipulation but it ended up being just that. My first two attempts to post were unsuccessful, for my third I added in a GME thesis based on RKT gains and reinvestment. Once I put in GME the post went through successfully. The post then received 118 likes and 10 awards. All of the awards came from accounts with ""double names"" e.g. rujwal\_rujwal, ujjwal\_ujjwal. These accounts were formed the same day and are now deactivated. I intend to retry this experiment, again with fire ASO data and graphs both with and without a GME mention. 

My concern is that, to the opposite of what many on the forum believe, that bots are being used to pump GME. One of the top posts currently is a DD stating that short interest has increased to 1000% that completely misunderstands almost everything it uses as a data point. It's a fact that GME is the most heavily shorted stock, it's also a fact that liking a stock and buying it wouldn't lead to prosecution for participating in a pump and dump. But these factually incorrect, and lengthy posts, pumping GME recently absolutely fall within 77q and 10b-5.

I believe tons of retail investors will make money on GME, and it is as good a speculative play as any, but I have a feeling that this time around there will be even more retail bag holders. There is absolutely a pump and dump scheme revolving around GME and WSB. Try it yourself, post a GME DD and look at the awards/likes. 

Getting off of the GME pump, and sounding too close to a schizophrenic for my liking, there appears to be institutional manipulation of ASO. ASO is currently the third most shorted stock and had a blow out last earnings and looks to do even better when it reports this month. The only OTM options for near term are $25, $30 and $35. If you look at Friday's close you will see that it closed just under $25 for purposes of options expiry, despite being above the prior two days, and then returned above just after market close. Yesterday saw it rise over 10%, which was immediately reversed today on much less volume. I have no doubt that it will close under $25 again this week despite any wild rides on the way there. You can also see something similar happening almost every morning, with a high volume buy up and then less volume carrying it down throughout the day.","ASO Manipulation, GME bot activity",1.0,1615335972,USAG1748
77,m1knli,"Hello fellow Ape,

I've been seeing a bunch of DD saying that the launchpad is prepped for GME, and rocket is t-minus 1-6 days to Uranus.

just reminding you that Robinhood WILL limit buying more GME just like they did last time. Remember to use a broker with a larger balance sheet, just like fellow monke Mark Cuban said. 

Schwab, Fidelity, E\*Trade, etc.

I up like 5k the last two days and it is blowing my mind. I was an executive chef. I have worked 100 hours in a week. I almost feel like I am taking back those hours I was never compensated for. It all trickles down right? Anyways, this community is the tightest and kindest I have ever experienced on Reddit and I have been on this site for over 10 years. (acct is only 9 years.) I have seen movements come and go, but holy tits this community is wholesome. It goes to show how effective income inequality is at fucking with our heads. We are all about to feel relief we could have never imagined. We are going to be able to take care of our loved ones, chase our dreams, and take a fucking deep breath for once. I know some folks are already there, but man financial stability is something foreign to me. My mom is almost 60 and is working 60 hours a week because my Dad has a chronic disease and had to go on disability at 50. We lost our house in 08.

u/Deepfuckingvalue, so far, is the only person I've ever met who absolutely 💯 without a doubt DESERVES every single dollar he has coming to him. He is the reason why many of you apes are here following some dumb trend you think is cool because you think it's FREE &amp; EASY MONEY.

News flash, it's not. Not even remotely close. If you really think you're ready for what *could* happen, you're gonna go for the ride of your life and you are statistically guaranteed to fall off before the ride is over. 

Why? Because of 1 thing. This 1 thing is LITERALLY the reason 90% of you are even here touting ""GME"" everyday... and it's the 1 thing many of you fail to do, and why those of you will never see 100k. 

This post doesn't apply to everyone. It only applies to the following people.. those who: 

• Joined Reddit &amp; WSB after January 27th
• Are investing for the first time, ever
• Who bought GME at &gt;$300 because of FOMO
• Posts  💎🤚 without ever doing a single DD on GME or any stock, or on ANY SUBJECT WHATSOEVER for that matter.

If this does not apply to you, you are among the very few who WILL see 100k (or more). 

For those of you who took the time to write your own lengthy DD post or article or video... my hat's off to you. You're my heroes and you are why I'm here every single day. Seriously, If I was gay, I'd let you all give me a raise. 

YOU WANT TO KNOW THE SECRET TO 100K??? 

It's RESEARCH! The #1 thing you learn more about in those first 12 years of school than Anything Else! 

R.E.S.E.A.R.C.H. 

Reading, bookmarking, more reading, taking notes, organizing, asking questions, verifying information, studying it...


These are the key fundamentals that will allow you to sit on your 💎🤚 like DFV while that asking price on GME blows waaayyyyyy beyond 1k, wayyyy past 10k, and even beyond 100k!
