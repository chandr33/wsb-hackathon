0,lwybmb,"Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO) is criminally undervalued and flying under the radar right now. It beat last quarter’s earnings by 2.4x predictions, and upcoming earnings will be the catalyst needed to make ASO skyrocket. Guns are a major part of their sales, and January 2021 had the 3rd highest single-month gun sales recorded in US history.

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**Fundamental Analysis:**

**Gun Sales**

Academy Sports and Outdoors is focused on selling hunting, fishing, and camping equipment. A major point of interest in this company is its gun sales. So long as ASO continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns, they will continue to grow, especially in todays climate. Gun sales are up in January from previous months, with the third-highest monthly total of gun sales on record ([Gun sales surged 80 percent in January, data shows - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)). On top of that, the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks is up 30.53% from last year’s monthly average, from 3,307,943 background checks per month in 2020 to 4,317,804 in January 2021 ([NICS Firearm Checks: Month/Year — FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)).

CEO Ken Hicks claims that many people picked up new hobbies such as hunting, fishing, and camping, which has helped drive sales. And if only 20-30% of those people continue with those hobbies, it will greatly help their sales ([Academy Sports CEO says hobbies acquired during COVID will continue to drive sales in 2021 - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-ceo-says-hobbies-acquired-during-covid-will-continue-to-drive-sales-in-2021-11608054715)). Especially if many are scared of future potential gun restrictions created by the Democrat-controlled Congress, now could be a time where we see a surge of gun purchases before any restrictions are made, which would drive ASO sales.

Location-wise, ASO is in the perfect position to continue making sales year-round. Located in the South, people can continue their outdoor activities throughout the winter, providing ASO with sales when it may not otherwise have been able to if it were located further north.

&amp;#x200B;

**IPO and Leadership**

In 2011, KKR bought out ASO, however, ASO recently went public on October 2, 2020. Led by CEO Ken Hicks, ASO is well-positioned to continue boosting its sales. As CEO at Foot Locker, Hicks helped reverse three years of negative same-store sales, and he brings his experience in other executive positions to the table ([Academy Sports + Outdoors Announces Ken C. Hicks as Chairman and CEO - ASO](http://corporate.academy.com/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-ken-c-hicks-as-chairman-and-ceo/index.html)).

ASO is clearly focused on growth, rather than maintenance. Effective Jan 29, 2021, ASO eliminated the COO position at ASO “in order to create a more efficient operating structure and focus on key strategic priorities” ([Academy Sports eliminates COO role - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-eliminates-coo-role-2021-01-21)). It is focused on increasing its efficiency and sales. This is also indicated by the fact that it just went public, meaning it intends to use the money gained from its public offering to help grow the company.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stimulus Bill**

The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that was passed by the House on Feb 2, 2021, would be a huge boost to the company if it were to pass the Senate. This is not exclusive to ASO, but it would help the overall economy, and give more disposable income for people to spend, and help boost sales.

&amp;#x200B;

[Financials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d-1TgdKxr_Bz1f3yDdQ6Uclt04MxzXJivPQmDEUirw/edit?usp=sharing) **(obtained from Yahoo Finance; click title for link to spreadsheet)**

This is a key part of my valuation of ASO. It displays how criminally undervalued ASO is a company relative to the market as a whole, as well as its competitors. I have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why ASO is undervalued relative to its competitors. I will compare ASO’s financials to Dick’s Sporting Goods, as they are the most similar competitor.

ASO’s trailing P/E ratio is currently 10.82, as compared to DKS’ 17.56

ASO’s forward P/E is 9.78, as compared to DKS’ 14.9

ASO’s P/S (ttm) is 0.41, as compared to DKS’ 0.74

ASO’s P/B (mrq) is 2.29, as compared to DKS’ 3.15

Additionally, its most recent actual earnings (0.91 eps) were 2.4x its predicted earnings (0.39 eps), and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 0.48 eps, still well below last quarters earnings ([ASO 23.96 -0.78 -3.13% : Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO?p=ASO)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt**

ASO’s debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators. They have a great deal of debt, with their debt to equity ratio sitting at 272.59 (as compared to DKS’ 150.66). However, ASO has already designated around $200 million obtained from their IPO to help pay off some debt ([Is This Retail IPO a Winner? | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/17/is-this-retail-ipo-a-winner/)). They also have the ability to pay off short-term debt, so I do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt. Their current ratio (mrq) is 1.61 and although this is significantly lower than many other gun-related companies, it is actually lower than DKS’ 1.4, which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their short-term debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Interest**

While I am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock, it can still be a helpful tool. According to [S3 Research](https://www.shortsight.com/category/s3-research/), ASO’s short interest as a percentage of its float is 28.18%, as compared to DKS’ 14.97%. Both of these are fairly high, and show that there is great short interest against both these companies. Although I strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze, over time I believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions, and will definitely help fuel ASO’s stock price growth.

**Technical Analysis:**

ASO has been following a strict channel since its IPO in October as seen below. It has bounced off support and resistance multiple times, but still remains in this channel. ASO is currently hitting the bottom of the channel, and I believe it will soon bounce back. This is a perfect stock for MMs to manipulate and keep in this channel, with small volume and sizeable bid-ask spread:

https://preview.redd.it/lf1ye790duk61.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408a12894490a9040f3a6a095b6cc96caa354cf2

&amp;#x200B;

This channel has major support. At the end of January 2020, ASO announced its secondary offering, and the stock price plummeted, only to hit support and bounce right back:

https://preview.redd.it/wpq6m5v1duk61.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3578e028b55e3d721fa36273148b3872d113a9e

This channel has some retard support, and ASO is the perfect stock for MMs. It has a low volume, high bid-ask spread, and high institutional ownership (sitting at about 75%).

I am not a financial advisor, and none of you retards should construe what I say as financial advice. These are simply my beliefs based on the research that I have personally conducted.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to link ""Financials"" section to my spreadsheet

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: AutoMod is deleting my comments because I don't have enough karma for some reason, so I will try to respond to some of your questions here:

1.) For charting, I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim.

2.) I have noticed multiple people questioning ASO because it is nearing its ATH. Just because it is nearing its ATH does not mean that it cannot go higher. I do not believe that its old ATH is an accurate valuation of the company, and so I believe it will break through that price. As u/uncowisdo pointed out in the comments, Amazon's ATH was $70 at one point. 

3.) Someone also asked why I have 3/19 and 4/16 calls if my target price of $30 is dated 5/1. This is because I bought them before I knew the earnings report date (and I still don't believe they have officially announced it as 4/8 yet). Also, their costs were relatively low compared to the potential upside. And being the retard that I am, I only know how to buy and not sell, so I will be holding onto them.",$ASO DD Criminally Undervalued,0.83,1614789923,XionTG

Luckily Reddit management was willing to address it which was big on their part and a lot of the mod team has been brought back. That being said, the strain on our mods and their bots being reconfigured, replaced, and abandoned slows down the abilities of the team.

I picture a literal Game-Stop, a place where people stop the grind of life and come and game together.

- What if Game Stop hosted game night for groups of people and if D&amp;D is too complicated, staff would teach players how to play the game?

- What about PC and console games being released before market sale to play only at Game Stop ""arcades"" where only prerelease games are available to be played before becoming available for the home, like movies at a theater before being released on video?

- Or small scale hosting of ""deck games"" where people can get together and play together or have tournaments? 

- Hey waiter, I'll have a burger and drink please; players ordering food that is brought directly to their gaming table!

78,lwyjf4,"**TL;DR UNFI is going to bull run all the way to March 10 as there are 7 days to cover before pandemic earnings drop a nuke on the shorts.**

Inspired by the RKT earnings events last week, here’s the DD on a similar situation with UNFI upcoming earnings. Where do we start with this stock. It is basically trading at the same price as it did in late 2018 and 65% off its highs in 2015. Being in the grocery business during a pandemic, last earnings were amazing as it reported 6% increase in net sales, 31% increase in EBITDA, and 1,175% increase in EPS.

[Strong Start to Fiscal 2021](https://preview.redd.it/c939za9eeuk61.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf609c0fbb9f23dad7154bd08888a77544a0ea79)

UNFI is strong financially, with about $21 per share on the books (P/B ratio 1.3), current PE ratio of about 13 and expected to go even lower as they keep reporting pandemic earnings. Using those earnings to pay off debt way ahead of schedule and strengthening their financial position further.

So what’s the short interest? The answer - around 22%. If you look at the low trading volume, 12.5M shares short with 7 days to cover, average volume is about 1.5M. As of posting this volume is **201,857**. Low float of 52M shares. Since 90% of the float is locked away by institutions, shares for trade are even fewer. And what’s 7 days from now? Another pandemic earnings call. There’s not enough volume during the day to cover all those shares. The last earnings time this happened, the stock doubled and now in 2021 short interest is at all time highs. Hate to say it, but COVID has been very good to UNFI.

[UNFI Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/gwiq16skeuk61.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8610a098dab6413d2bbd1eced4dcac176113be58)

I could talk about how inflation is rising and how that impacts the price of groceries, but that’s not why I think the stock will rise in the next 7 days.

Earnings scheduled for the **morning of  March 10** and there is a good chance for fatal blows to the shorts. Be it the announcement of:

* **Amazon Deal** – to be the exclusive supplier to all Whole Foods locations
* **Property Sales** – their retail business (Cub Foods) or unused real estate (underutilized distribution centers) to strengthen balance sheet and pay off more debt
* **New CEO Replacement**  –  last year confirmed that current CEO will be retiring in July 2021 and a new CEO will be announced early 2021

A large short interest with 7 days to cover right on earnings day would give an insane rise. I would anticipate 60%+ to mid 40s or even higher. This would make the market cap only 2.5B (up from 1.5B) for a company that has sales of 27B. **No other company has a revenue to market cap ratio that high!** UNFI used to be in the 40s in 2018 and hit an all-time-high of $80 back when its revenue was only 8B in 2015. Now revenues are 3x higher, but the stock is 3x lower.

UNFI is recruiting diamond hands. Shorts don't want to see the army of autists and apes gunning for 100%.

**I like the stock. Buy shares, squeeze shorts, and make money.**
