19,m6eojo,"I bought 100 shares of AMC @ 12.60 and sold a call @ 13.50 $1.16 March 19th. I could not find any indicator in my Fidelity app or website, but I do not have enough to be considered a day trader. I would like to possibly grab another 100 shares and sell another call as I think stimmy checks may just bump AMC $14+ and would be easy in and out profit (I guess I could always just hold 100 shares, as well).

My question is, is it considered a ""day trade"" only if the call is exercised today or is it a day trade since I bought 100 shares today and immediately sold a covered call against it? Since I technically still have the stock, it is not a complete transaction. I want to ensure I am not going over the 3 a day limit.

 (Context) Avery informing Captain Gibson of the *Duke* (who was a notorious drunkard) that he was taking over the ship and going pirate.

*""Come, don't be in a fright, but put on your clothes, and I'll let you into a secret. You must know that I am Captain of this ship now, and this is my cabin, therefore you must walk out. I am bound to Madagascar, with a design of making my own fortune, and that of all the brave fellows joined with me...if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you, and if you'll turn sober, and mind your business, perhaps in time I may make you one of my Lieutenants, if not, here's a boat alongside and you shall be set ashore.""*

33,m6er2t,"I was doing some DD after being called out for thinking 10k+ a share is not feasible. After crunching some numbers, I came to realize it *could* be, but the entire argument boiled down to ""where are our tendies coming from?"" in this situation. 

@ $10k a share, market cap of $GME would be 697,500,000,000 which is around a third of $AAPL's market cap. Now, Melvin and Citadel couldn't cover all of this which helped me understand just *why* we are so pissed off at them. Someone else would have to cover their short positions, which would be the DTCC if I am not mistaken. 

The DTCC says, ""Its depository provides custody and asset servicing for securities issues from 131 countries and territories valued at U.S. $57.4 trillion."" which *I think* means they can insure up to that amount. But they only have $49 billion in assets, so *they* couldn't insure the shares with their own balance sheet. 

*So who's money would it be that is being used to insure our shares if we moon?* 

The only entity I can think of is the Fed's, which would mean taxpayer dollars would be used *yet again* for a bailout bigger than the 2008 crisis by almost $200 billion @ $10k a share. If this is the case, wouldn't we be losing in this situation as the average American citizen considering how bad 2008 fucked us?

Either way though, I want my motherfuckin' tendies. 42 shares @ 180 average and holding.",Who insures our shares if we moon?,1.0,1615916595,doubleknottedlaces

I want you to understand these people in this sub do not give a single shit about you or what happens to your livelihood.
