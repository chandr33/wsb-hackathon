17,m13byb,"Am I the only one seeing the potential for this new tactic by the HFs?

Instead of trying to push the price down, which coagulates more people in the battle (and eventually attracts even more retail investors), they could momentarily try to control the rise to 300-500$, so to give the (false) impression that the peak has been reached.

Transforming lots of people's hands in paper?

It would be risky and probably cost millions, but it would also save TRILLIONS and - in the process of going up - the HFs will find a way to make money in any case.

I am not implying any conspiracy but I wanted to warn people that yesterday and today the Revolut app has been very unreliable reporting GME price.

Yesterday it seemed that force closing the app on my android phone helped, but that could be coincidence.

All I'm saying is check another source, don't rely on it.
