3,m5jk71,"I spoke to Moody's CCO today on Zoom. 

He told me indirectly that variable rates on credit is not accounted for/weighted heavily in their rating assignment , nor has it become a more significant part of their rating model process since the pandemic - citing that interest between the 0-2% bound is a structural certainty over the next 3 years and reaffirmed by the FED.

I have a problem with this. Because corporate credit in the US alone ballooned more than 10% last year, and those on variable rates will get crushed if yields continue to move higher DESPITE the fact that they're still being rated top notch investment grade (BECAUSE THEY DONT TAKE VARIABLE SQUEEZES INTO ACCOUNT!) 

In my opinion this missrating then of corporate credit is why CDX index is positioned exactly where it was July Pre-COVID and you can't use the inflation argument because so much of this debt is variable rate. 

So if yields keep moving higher, despite what Mr Moody might think about the 0-2% bound, then the credit ratings this corporate credit has been assigned is going to look awfully difficult to justify, and more often than not, the market follows the rating agency downgrades. With that, if we see Moodys hand forced to downgrade a cascade of debt, then the CDX is going to explode. ESPECIALLY if we see yields move higher before debt lined brick and mortar businesses are allowed to open their doors to customers again.

What the hell is going on...am I crazy or are we literally seeing a repeat of 2007. 

Like it or not, I think this could be a deep value play on inflation.

6,m5jl46,"Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what’s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next…

So, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.

For example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn’t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.

These past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.

But guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.

Given that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks. 

NIO’s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company’s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.

Investors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO’s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.

I still have a mixed opinion about NIO’s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption 🚀🚀

The other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.

I really like Zoom’s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.

[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.

You can see, even the company doesn’t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.

Zoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.

Guys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well 🚀🚀

We can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%

So, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it’s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don’t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.

Moving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn’t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.

One other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.

Friends, you shouldn’t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it’s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days. 

You should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.

I also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.

**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!🚀**

I don’t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don’t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops 🚀🚀🚀

8,m5jlem,"Ok so I've outlined a majority of things in my DDs, ranging from what the new rules mean, the margin and the matrix etc (please go back and read my previous DD if you think I'm not making sense). 

In this DD, I'm setting out what I think they all might mean for this trading week, as we all know it's a biggie. Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.

A lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.

So this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. 

Further, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short affiliates as time progresses. 

I'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

**Catalyst 1**
So first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. 

Remember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. 

Therefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.

This in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.

**Catalyst 2*""
The new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.

This alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.

As we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.

**Catalyst 3**
If the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.

This means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.

This is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. 

Which in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?

**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**

This is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. 

Sorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go 🚀.

Therefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.",Simplifying Law DD series Part III - the vicious cycle of margin and SLD,1.0,1615811259,Leaglese

# Lets fucking Go.

**The Thesis**

1 - Canoo Inc. has /u/deepfuckingvalue which is unrecognized by its current SP.

2 - Shorts pressed GOEV from an average share price of 17-18 dollars down to 10.

3 - There is a recent sudden catalyst of macro market conditions and sudden revelations about the product line which has caused a sudden revaluation of the company.

4 - There is a tactical and benevolent long who constructed a GAMMA ramp and is pushing the SI into it. The past week we have seen strategic gap openings to utilize the gamma ramp. 16 is our next prize.

5. At a certain point the short interest will be untenable and margins will get called.

6. One may Profit.

**If any of that has changed the thesis must be updated and expectations adjusted.**

# The numbers.

# Ortex - [Shows us that](https://u.teknik.io/H9JPX.png)

* Short Interest dropped to 8.7M
* DTC - Dropped to 1.23 - I( think this is a function of our absolutely gigantic high-volume day
* 3/19 Options Ladder - [Psycho Tier](https://u.teknik.io/3hsac.PNG)

/u/pennyether might drop us a charm stat soon.  Ill put it up here.

# This is by far a done deal.

As we saw Friday a large player on the short side initiate a gamma attack by purchasing a metric fuck ton of Puts which altered the buy/sell orders coming from MM to maintain their delta neutral stance to move to the sell side.  Essentially temporarily cut off from their supply lines of support, Longs struck a retreat, pulled the backstops and ran with the price down to what it opened at.  While the prices of options cratered, someone bought a fuckton of hyper cheap 15$ calls and closed them out.  This is either

* A - A market maker looking for a good deal on hedging some short positions
* B - A Ronin slipping in to scalp the fruits of war.
* C - The short interest essentially turning states witness and hedging their outstanding short interest at a price 90 cents higher than the current share price.

There was some theory as to a Long taking down the Gamma Ramp but its still there, Loud and Proud.

The SP stabilized, the longs forced the Shorts to begin to spend short interest at lower prices and we closed higher than we started the day.

We are now in an active fight.  Expect it to get messy.  This isn't just spend money and win 8 million shares at a sp of 17 is **136 million dollars** they stand to lose at the very least. People have been murdered for way less.  Don't expect them to go down without a fight.  You wouldn't just walk away either.

Listen, the 16 is a magic number. I am not going to tell you what to do but after friday, that portion of the gamma ramp is done.  If we are not over 16 sooner rather than later, I feel differently about my 3/19 options than I did last week.

That isn't to say that I am highly fucking bullish about this play.  The amount of gambling tier call options being purchased at open will be astounding and I think in the end we will be victorious.

I ate too many crayons this morning and had an idea:
If 🦍 are strong together, why don't  🦍  have a proper say in what's happening at GME? Because 🦍 just buy together - so far don't vote together.


What if  🦍  had a platform to unite shareholder interest and get a WSB board representation at GME?
By simple 🦍 math I estimate that 🦍 hold about 15% of the stock (~10mm shares). That puts us at the top of the shareholder list:

I repeat if  🦍  vote together we have enough power to place board seats and steer the direction of the company.

TL;DR we like the stock. we own enough of the stock. we are GameStop.

See link for attached 2022 price estimates, the YOLO, and supplementary information.  This is not financial advise and do your own research prior to any investments. 

Link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF\_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**For those of you word-readers:** 

It appears that Bloomberg is trying to push a narrative that WSB is super interested in alternative miners based on one of their more recent articles.  I haven't seen any DD on this topic on WSB personally, so I figure let's help them out and discuss why alternative miners are not being evaluated properly by the market as a whole!  

**What is an ""Alternative Miner?""**

An alternative miner is a company that owns a large number of specialized computers, referred to as ""miners"".  These miners are used to create markets and verify transactions for digital currencies, and are rewarded set amounts of digital currencies for a successful verification in addition to any fees or spread in a purchase.  The primary costs for any alternative miner is the cost to purchase the mining computers, the cost to power the mining computers, and to pay for employees to monitor and repair any equipment.  

**How have alt miner stocks been trading and why?**

https://preview.redd.it/sqy6j0fox2n61.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2f3fca2fbc41ee45478ae61524e7465f71b6bd

https://preview.redd.it/hs7ydrh7y2n61.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9a78d3f7ee4d33890cb034b43683623b148ba09

As shown by the charts above, miners have had a hell of a run starting in November of 2020 all the way to now.  However, the share prices have been highly volatile, with companies in this space seeing drawdowns of 40% or more multiple times during this bull run.  Overall, the prices have been following the cost of the underlying asset they are mining, with large spikes when the asset it up and declines when it is down.  While the miners are following the asset, they have significantly outperformed thus far this year, shown by the table below.  Thus, my thought is that the market is viewing these miners as beta plays for the underlying assets and not evaluating the potential profitability and cash flows of these businesses. 

*Processing img eh9hmbdo53n61...*

&amp;#x200B;

**Getting into the numbers - Marathon Digital ($MARA):**

(Note - all tables below are shown in the following link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF\_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Now, I am a bit of an old school guy, and I still think the best way to value businesses is to see the amount of earnings or cash the firm produces and compare it to similar companies to see if it is under or overvalued.  I'll be going over the numbers for Marathon Digital, as it is the company in the space I have the most experience with.  For this walkthrough, I'm going to be looking at 2022 earnings, as the company is still in the process of receiving and installing a large number of miners.

https://preview.redd.it/u2rremv6f3n61.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d14c84426b7473c30daa0498565a5636dee5ac53

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok - where did you come up with these numbers and what do they mean?**

In the table above, I have put down my estimates for the company in 2021 based upon a number of assumptions:

* Revenues:  At the start of 2022, Marathon will have 103,000 s19 Antminers that will be mining the  digital currency that it supports.  The revenue number anticipates the dollar value of the assets it mines based upon the anticipated average price of the digital currency in 2022.  However, knowing the industry is  competitive, I have reduced the efficiency of Marathon's miners by 33% to account for the miners of competitors coming online during 2021 and 2022.
* Energy Costs:  Marathon is in an agreement with Beowulf Energy to purchase all 105 megawatts from the Hardin facility to power the 103k miners.  An agreed price of 2.8 cents per kilowatt hour allows Marathon to have some of the cheapest power for miners while competitors commonly pay 4-5 cents KWh and works itself out to energy costs to Marathon of $96M annually.
* G&amp;A - As this company is computers mining, there are very limited G&amp;A expenses.  The 12M per year anticipates 2M in security costs, total salaries paid increasing by 100%, and other expenses of 4M each year.  Compared to 2019 G&amp;A of 3M, this is a very conservative outlook for the company.
* Depreciation: The average life of a mining computer is 2 to 3 years depending on the amount of ventilation and temperature of the computers surroundings.  Marathon itself discounts the life of its computers at 2 years, which is slightly more pessimistic than the 2.5 expected years.
* Thus boiling these numbers down, the company is extremely profitable and showcases a net margin (profit margin) of 43.5% and a P/E of 21 even if the digital asset falls to 30K.

**That's cool, but why do I give a shit?  Aren't there a lot of profitable companies?**

Not this profitable.  There are four companies that are in the market making / payment verification market that have this high of net margins: Visa, Mastercard, CME Group, and MarketAxess.  Current P/Es of all four companies have been pull and discounted by 8% to simulate the P/E ratios of these firms in 2022, which is done in order to compare Marathon in 2022 to these companies in 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/wva9gcucg3n61.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df10255d0fd0d6f635bfae7818c9342ee947d980

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now each of these companies trade at a premium to Marathon, with the lowest PE of the three (CME Group) still priced at a 50% premium to the digital miner.   This indicates to me that MARA would be significantly underpriced, even if the underlying were to fall 50% to the 30k range. 

**So then, what do you think this company should be valued at?** 

https://preview.redd.it/2kndnpesg3n61.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f850571ed15066ebc4a2eef4a58e400d664ae089

First off, the value of this company is going to be heavily dependent on the price of the underlying asset, so I've been showing results when it is at a variety of different prices.  I'll go with the result that is closest to current price levels which is 50k.  Using this level, a market value of Marathon was calculated using a P/E ratio equal to the average of the four peers (48.17x) and using the P/E of the cheapest firm (32.99x).  These two market caps are then averaged and discounted back to 2021 and a price estimate for Marathon of $162.94, indicating a possible 300% upside for the name from the current price of $40.70.  

**So you like the stock and you created a nice story for it - how big are you in?**

https://preview.redd.it/f48msucyi3n61.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be92f4131113832e5899b48363854434ac7ab868

**EVERYTHING.**  98% of all my investments (retirement &amp; personal investments) are in alternative miner equity or calls on alternative miners.  I'm confident in my research - alternative miners are cash cows and Wall Street hasn't realized it yet.  The miners I'm invested in have no debt on their books, and once the big boy financers realize that these are not gimmick companies, these shares are going to be primed to skyrocket.  Feel free to hop on the train!
