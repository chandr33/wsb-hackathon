Archegos Capital, a prop trading firm run by Bill Hwang (apparently not a smart man), managed to completely blow up his $80 billion portfolio in true WSB fashion, the sheer idiocy and magnitude of this blowup makes us all look like mormon choir boys. This fucking guy had 5:1 leverage on $16 billion of capital invested in china growth/tech *at the peak of the fucking tech surge*, and *didn't fucking de-leverage* during the most obvious sector rotation ever 6 weeks ago. It's all gone now. Liquidated. To zero. He was heavy into china tech / growth stocks on 5x margin, $80 billion portfolio. Poof. 

Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place. Rumor has it, all of the different PB's this guy borrowed margin from agreed to an orderly selloff during the forced liquidation, but some unknown PB front ran them like a total cocksucking wench and liquidated all at once, causing a violent crash in BIDU and Viacom.

Martinrea International is a stock that designs, develops and manufactures automotive parts. With the pandemic unwinding, demand for vehicles is likely to go up in the future, and this could spur demand for automotive manufacturing. This is on top of the fact the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels.

The stock is a major bargain at the moment, trading at just $12.54CAD, while analysts give price targets of $17.00, an average of $18.94 and a high of $22.00. If any of the analysts currently looking at the stock are correct, the stock is poised for a gain of 35-76%. The stock recently suffered a poor Q4 result, which was followed by quite a large dip. They suffered a 12% decrease in profit even though their sales grew. However, it was noted that if you take adjusted profit that excludes most one time items, profits actually grew by 31%. Effectively the market may be underestimating the value of MRE.

In terms of statistics, the stock has a P/S ratio of 0.3 and a P/B ratio of 0.86. MRE is currently trading even below its book value. This compares favourably to competitors like Magna International, which has a P/S of 1.01 and a P/B of 2.89 or Linamar which has a P/S of 0.83 and a P/B of 1.12.

From a technical perspective, the stock is quite solid. The daily price has just formed a tweezer bottom pattern, suggesting the stock is likely to move upwards. Moreover, the stock is sitting right above a major trendline that has been touched 4-6 times in the past. Thus it could be predicted that the stock will bounce off this trendline once again. Third, the most recent peak sits at a price level of around $12.20, so if the other resistance levels were to fail, this would likely pose another resistance level for the stock. Finally, the 14 day RSI currently sits at 30.26. This is the lowest RSI since the start of the pandemic and could be indicative of an oversold condition. This could provide additional evidence for a reversal in trend in the near future. Each time when the stock moves from peak to trough it appears to take approximately 2-4 months. If this trend continues, this could potentially be the time horizon in which to anticipate the stock returning from a bottom to a top in the future, although this is an assumption that will not necessarily hold true.

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart of MRE stock price. Recent peak that presents resistance is circled. RSI value that is the lowest since the pandemic start is circled in the purple pane. Tweezer bottom at current price is circled, although not readily visible unless you zoom in. Some projected trendlines are included.](https://preview.redd.it/zs09qrkpfwp61.png?width=1646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66fec66fdd354fa56fe7ffbf41eed1b957a17bf1)

A relatively safe play might be to wait for reasonable confirmation of a reversal in the stock price and to take a conservative sell target at the most recent high, which was at about 16.21. If one were to buy at the current closing price and sell at that high, this would represent a gain of about 29.3% with an expected time horizon of approximately 2-4 months. However, it is possible the stock will exceed that level based on analyst estimates.

TLDR; MRE appears to be an undervalued stock ripe for a reversal in the future. Potential gains may exceed 30% based on analyst estimates and technical analysis. The anticipated time horizon for the trade is approximately 2-4 months based on previous movements in the stock's price.

*Mainly for the boomer apes, but important for all. 

I don‚Äôt think this aspect is getting enough attention, but I think it‚Äôs important. 

Since most of us, aren‚Äôt conducting trades by calling up our brokers, I think it goes without saying that your brokerage account username and password are the only things preventing someone else from accessing your shares. The boom in online trading resulted in a parallel boom of hacking on those very same online brokerages. Some brokerages have extra protection measures that will protect you in case someone has your tried logging into your account like 2F authentication, which I recommend using, but DO NOT RELY ON THIS. You have to take your security in to your own hands. You WILL be responsible for the money you lose, Your brokerage WILL NOT reimburse you if your money is wired elsewhere and the FDIC insurance DOES NOT cover you. With that being said here are a couple of tips:

-Do not use the same password for anything. Data breaches happen frequently and I know most of you boomers use the same password for everything. Do not compromise yourself and leave yourself vulnerable this way.

-Make LONG passwords, or better yet use the strong passwords generated by Google or Apple. Write them down and keep them in a safe or something.

-Enable 2 factor authentication

-Beware of any link that you click. Don‚Äôt fall pray to any PHISHING links. Do not enter any personal information on any website that you are not familiar with. And tell than Nigerian prince pen pal who wants to send you  1 million to fuck off.

Don‚Äôt get stripped of your hard earned tendies $$$

I‚Äôve been laid off from my job of 3 years after covid, I‚Äôm struggling to make ends meet, catch up on rent, and feed my family
I‚Äôve been doordashing and doing what I can to make income, I even tried investing when I can in stocks and had to pull it all out
I‚Äôm just trying to find the littlest act of generosity and get back in a good place and on my feet again. I know it‚Äôs not a good idea to post in this sub and ask, but figured it was worth the try
Anything would help
Much love to everyone, and god bless
