8,m2gw3n,"Let me start by saying my main language is not english, so if my way of writing is weird or nonsense, please excuse me; I'm trying my best.  
Also, I NEED to post this or my mind will explode so, please, be kind; I might delete it soon just so it doesn't bother anybody here.

I found out about WSB and GME around early January. A friend of mine talked to me about investing in cryptos, so I made a little research and found this awesome reddit. Immediately noticed all this was a battle WE HAD to fight. For the people. For the poor ones. For us, to prove them WE WILL NOT stand allowing them to laugh and steal from us, so I told my friend about GME and what it will become, talking about DFV and how accurate this play was, and he trusted me, so he spent 800 @ 250... and then the short ladder attack the (¿28th of January?) got him out and took all that money away. Lost it all.  


I thought that was it and felt guilty, because I convinced him to invest, but then...

He didn't tell me untill today, but he tried a super crazy thing: he asked for a 5k loan and tried to recover that money by investing it again in GME @ 230+ this week. Just because of all the faith he saw I had in you apes and got inspired.  
Again, with today's short ladder attack, he LOST IT ALL for a second time... 5000 all gone because he didn't have enough funds to endure that freaking unreal drop...  
He didn't tell his parents, his girlfriend nor any other friend; just me. And he was completely destroyed. It's the actual first time I saw him crying and absolutely depressed, and it's shocking because he is one of the happiest people I've ever met.  
Now he has a debt he might be unable to pay anytime soon, a debt he will be struggling with every month from now, and his GF will find out in a month or two and might leave him. I'm scared that he'll do something REALLY STUPID if that happens.  
I have no idea what to do or how to help, because I have no money to borrow from anybody (hell, I don't even have enough to live on my own; I still live with my family thanks to COVID), but I feel completely responsible for this. I was the one that told him about GME. I was the one that convinced him to invest. If it wasn't for me, he would be fine!  I've been selfish and I've made a dear friend of mine suffer for it...  


Guilt is killing me. I don't know what I can do for him. And it also hurts me that I failed you retards. I really wanted to be a part of this movement. I really wanted to fight for what we deserve! To help the people! And all I ended up achieving is failing.  
I failed my friend.  
I failed you guys.  
I failed my ideals.  
I'm so sorry, everyone... Please, forgive me...

**Quote from Forbes Article, Wednesday evening 3/10**

&gt;Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in ***GME $270 call options for Friday March 12.*** The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt; ***A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share***. It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk. They would have covered, hedged, by purchasing shares – adding to the surge.

33,m2h0bj,"Hello, typically I'd make about 200-300 dollar monthly deposit in my trading account to buy stocks, but I want to take full advantage of this stimulus check. I'm trying to map out my options here. Here are some of the things im thinking I wanna do with the 1400.

Buy 100 ZNGA shares at around 10 bucks a share, assuming it doesn't move much in the next week or so, and then use the other 400 to purchase debit spreads on RKT. 3 months til expiration, strike 53.89-58.89 at 20 cents a pop. So roughly 18 contracts with a max profit of 500 a contract if RKT goes above the strike of course. Not a bad play. 

The other plan would be to buy RKT shares, about 50 for 1250, and buy ZNGA leaps, 2 years til expiration for cheap. I just don't know which direction I wanna go. I'm trying to stick with those two stocks because they have been on my radar and I don't wanna think about any other plays just to not complicate shit. 

100 shares on Zynga I feel wouldn't necessarily make me a ton of profits for a while, probably til the next earnings, but I do like the stock a lot. And it's cheap. But the RKT debit spreads could make me a decent amount of money and RKT is a stock that's being watched and talked about a lot. 

On the other hand, I wanna buy RKT while it's in this range, and the stock has held up pretty decently, hopefully ready to run soon. Still decent money to be made if it can hit 40 in the next couple months.

53,m2h3yu,"I am smooth brained but here is my logic for why the hedges havent covered, the squeeze hasnt begun and I am more bullish than ever.

1. Even by conservative estimations of how fucked they are, $325 peak wouldnt be anywhere close to them being able to cover all their shorts.

2. If the price rise was from them covering, who the fuck was erecting sell walls? Seems very counterintuitive to cuck your own plan if that were the case.

3. The CEO of interactive brokers let slip live on air that GME was running into the thousands before buying was halted in January. Since then the hedge funds have dug themselves into a much, much deeper hole. 4 figures is now a very conservative amount per share.

4. This is speculation but you'd imagine there would be dialogue between the DTCC and Shitadel. If they had it under control (either they had a convincing means to stop the squeeze or eat the peak) then I doubt the DTCC would have been concerned enough to try push through the new rules. Shitadel and co. Could eat up a $325 peak and not go bankrupt.

5. The fuckery and data shows they are petrified of us passing $350-$400. I think we could be nearing a price where they could be margin called (be north of those numbers) 

6. Why are they still weaponising the media to convince us GME is dead? They are DESPERATE for us to know it is over. If they had it under control they would just short it down without much fuss to the price they can close their positions at.

7. The HFs arent stupid and wouldnt have shorted it so much to get us on the SSR, there are definitely big players on our side who know what they are doing

8. I think we were ahead of a lot of people's price estimates and we still have so many catalysts to come (quad witching, stimmies, Cohen becoming CEO) all of these will spike interest and the price
Yes the bear trap seemed to come out of nowhere after such a steady rise but diamond hands are formed under pressure and it was never going to be a smooth journey. I believe the German market will boost us back up to $280s for a fresh run at $300 today.

65,m2h4zy,"While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, ""Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower."" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  🚀🚀🚀.",Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k,0.79,1615434598,zilliput

Very simple analysis here... Ape with some money, yes, invest. Now Ape with free $1400 casino play credits, invest all $1400 and also some of wife's boyfriend's $1400 too. Plus new apes appear out of the jungle reading about tendies from this week and also decide they like the stock and want tendies too, they invest.

Therefore GME go moon.


If too many words then try simple version below:

After stimulus: 🦍+💵💵💵 + 💎🙌🏼 = 🚀🚀🚀


To me, seems like a safe bet to hodl no matter what until at least after the stimmy. But this is not financial advice, I am eat crayon.

75,m2h6fg,"Fellow tards, gather round and hear a tale from your old retarded uncle. I have 4 kids aged from 8 y/o to 15 y/o and all of them are seriously and awfully addicted to the drug known as Roblox. How can this “game” attract such a wide age band? And how is my son, who is now 15, still playing the game after nearly 5 years?

So I did something completely out of character yesterday and actually spent a few minutes with my kids to find out why my wife’s boyfriend is spending real money on this “game”. 

I learned some shit I am not sure all of you autists actually realize. Here goes. 

**Roblox is a gaming platform.** Yes, you heard that right. Its not just a game but a vast gaming platform with hundreds of games catering to various age groups.

My 8 y/o plays something called Adopt
Me. She goes around breeding pets, making neons (whatever the fugg that is) and riding pets around like a crazy farmville zookeeper. 

My 10 y/o plays some fashion show game (Royale High or something) where they buy clothes and walk down a runway look its Ru Pauls drag race for kids. 

My 13 y/o plays something called Jailbreak where they pick between police or criminals and chase each other, driving around lambos and maclarens and shit (I actually really like this one). 

And my 15 y/o was showing me this auto racing game kinda like Project Cars. Like the cars actually looks decent and is fun to play for older kids. 

This platform actually seems to have staying power folks and I truly think its going to be something huge. Consoles will pick it up more broadly and new games will get created using the Roblox engine that cater to more and more demographics. 

Anyway that’s my $0.02. 

Tl;dr - Roblox is kiddie crack but actually more addictive and useful.
