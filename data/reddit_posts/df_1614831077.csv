13,lxcflg,"Lately, I've been seeing a lot of short attacks on FuboTV, after their earnings call a few days ago. This is extremely frustrating to see for this company, because I believe this company has huge growth potential, and I think the institutional investors knows it, too. My belief is that they are trying to reduce the value of this stock so that they can take advantage of cheaper prices, while fooling the retail investors into believing that this stock has no value. Please read below.

**“fuboTV Secures Market Access Agreements for Forthcoming fubo Sportsbook in Indiana, New Jersey Through Caesars Entertainment Inc.”**

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210303005944/en/fuboTV-Secures-Market-Access-Agreements-for-Forthcoming-fubo-Sportsbook-in-Indiana-New-Jersey-Through-Caesars-Entertainment-Inc](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210303005944/en/fuboTV-Secures-Market-Access-Agreements-for-Forthcoming-fubo-Sportsbook-in-Indiana-New-Jersey-Through-Caesars-Entertainment-Inc).

This news is so god damn juicy, and the institutional investors knows it. But I believe they are currently trying to downplay this to drop the share price of this stock, so that they can buy in large amounts at a much cheaper price.

Now why is this news so big?

(1) **Sports Betting Revenue Totals for each state (across all top betting platforms)**

a. **Indiana** – Approx. $209M (Draftkings accounts for $83M, Fanduel accounts for $51M)

b. **New Jersey** – Approx. $874M (Couldn’t find amount per platform, but I would estimate approx. $200M for Draftkings, going by their annual report figures)

New Jersey is the largest state (2nd being Nevada at 834M) where sports betting occurs. If we compare Draftkings to FuboTv – currently, Draftkings has about 1 million active monthly users on their platform, whereas FuboTV currently has approximately 540k, with an estimated growth to over 700k by end of 2021. If even just half of those users were to bet on the platform, we’re looking at approximately $100M in additional revenue generated for the company, and I think this is being conservative.

Also, these are just the initial states that fuboTV has secured market access with. We should expect more to come soon.

(2) **The company reported a major loss to earnings in their annual report due to approx. $200M in asset/goodwill impairment.**

Why is this important? Currently, the company is reporting approximately $400M of net losses for 2020, with half of those losses coming from asset/goodwill impairment. This impairment occurs due to an overvaluation of assets by the company and they are essentially correcting this asset value. We should not expect these large asset impairments YOY because impairment only occurred due to the company overvaluation of intangible assets after the merger with Facebank. With that said, I’m surprised at how low the analyst’s earning projections for the company was, even though everyone knew about the asset impairment losses prior to the earnings call. I think this low analyst projection hurt this company more because it caused a huge net loss surprise to investors.

(3) **Customer base doubled, Ad Revenue doubled, and revenue doubled from 2019-2020.**

The fact that this is being overlooked by so many investors is crazy to me. Based on these current projections, FuboTV should see approx. $500M+ of total revenue generation by end of 2021. By the time they start generating sports betting revenue, we’re looking at potentially a $1B+ revenue generating company by the end of 2022. When we factor in that asset impairments will be much lower by the end of this year, I am expecting that the company will start seeing huge net gains by end of 2022.

(4) **According to the Grand View Research (source below) The gambling market size was valued at $53.7B in 2019, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2020-2027**.

Meaning, by 2027, the gambling market is expected to be nearly double that of 2019.

This is a huge and rapidly growing market with plenty of revenue to share across multiple different platforms. Just because other betting companies may hold a larger share of the market doesn’t mean FuboTV will not greatly benefit from participating in this market.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These are just the few catalysts that I found from doing a little bit of research. There is plenty more, but I’m too lazy to write it out, and I believe just these few factors alone makes FuboTV an extremely valuable stock with exponential growth in the near future.

**EDIT:** FuboTV affiliates (if you're listening) - I think this company can greatly benefit from associating with Palantir's predictive Data Analytics software programs. Their tool can analyze the activity of this company and identify areas of excess cost burdens. This only makes sense for a company that is hoping to generate greater profits. As an investor, I plan to advocate this position to this company because I think it will stray a lot of the negative sentiment away (caused by the net losses this company has incurred).",FuboTV DD: Why I'm bullish on FuboTV,0.77,1614831506,Dantheweener

57,lxcnle,"Markets are correcting harder than your 6th grade math teacher on the first algebra test of the year because the yield on 10 year bonds has been shooting up. JPow loves all bulls and wants to see them prosper, and so the Fed will need to do something soon to get 10 year yield under control.

There's been a bunch of speculation about what tools the Fed might use to reduce yield - Yield Curve Control, Operation Twist etc. You can look up all that shit yourself. But no matter the strategy 10 year yields will need to fall for JPow to save his beloved bull children.

So what do we do? It's simple - bet on the Fed. $IEF is an ETF that tracks 7-10 year treasuries. I know it's confusing, but when yields go _up_, $IEF and other bond ETFs go _down_. When yields go _down_, where does $IEF go? I have nary a wrinkle on my brain and even I can figure it out - they go _up_.

When the Fed first announced infinite QE in March, the 10 year yield dropped to the 0.5% - 0.6% range. IEF reached $123 based on that drop in yield. If the Fed announces yield curve control in particular and targets a rate in that range, we'd expect to see IEF trade up to $123 again. You can see the price history [here](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/IEF/overview), and compare it to the yields on the 10 year [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countryCode=BX)

Why put even a half of a half of a percent into $IEF over any of your meme stocks? Why buy into this boomer crap? _IV on IEF options is super super low_. For the smoothest of brains sitting in the last row, that means you pay very little money per contract, and _any_ increase in volatility makes the price shoot up, possibly without your option even getting ITM. Today you could have bought the bond version of an FD and gotten a 3/19 123c for _3 cents_. If IEF goes up by $2, that option will be worth _at least_  13 cents, and that's assuming IV doesn't increase at all. If we go to that $123 level quickly due to YCC being announced this week and IV jumps to 30%, that option is worth almost $3 - _a 100x gain_.

Additionally, it seems someone else had this idea first. The open interest on some of these strikes is already pretty high for 3/19, as you can see here: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IEF/options?p=IEF&amp;date=1616112000

There's a downside here - if the Fed does nothing, or the Fed does something and markets refuse to react to it, these calls will 100% expire worthless - there's no chance of a gamma squeeze, short squeeze, squeeze bottle, catalysts or any of that shit. This play is 100% based on fundamentals and Fed action. 

**TLDR** - If you think the Fed will make 10 year yield go down, $IEF calls are a super high leverage bet on specifically that thing happening

Positions: Nothing yet as this only occurred to my dumb ass this evening, but at market open I'm buying IEF 4/16 116c to be responsible and IEF 3/19 123c to be a gambling degenerate. 

Additionally before anyone tries to accuse me of shilling fucking _bonds_ of all things, I have enough GME shares to buy at least 10 full nights from your mother and I'm not selling any of them.",Bet on the Fed - Consider calls on $IEF,0.82,1614832335,thehivemind5

TL/DR

* Look at that [options chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/options?date=1616112000), so many calls are expiring in the money and very few puts are.
* Oh yeah guess who has a history of buying those puts, our best pal Melvin.
* Price action has been steadily increasing and only is now the retard meme pattern taking over
* High short float,   now honestly this doesn't really mean shit. Except that literally  every  meme stock that's ever skyrocketed from WSB has had a high short  float.  So it's kind of a formality at this point.
* SKT is reinvesting their dividends.
* Biden recently claimed boosted vaccine production. That means an early time-frame for places like this to BOOM.
* SKT's market cap is lower than RKT so us retards have a bigger effect on the price
