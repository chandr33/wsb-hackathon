**This is about EXPOSING the ""free market"" they control.**

Naked Short Selling - High-Frequency Trading - Dark Pools - Phantom Shares - Guided Algorithms

This must be stopped. This is not a ""Free Market."" This is **CRIMINAL** behavior supported by Janet yellen and the SEC.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-yellen/bidens-treasury-nominee-yellen-discloses-paid-speaking-gigs-for-financial-firms-idUSKBN2961ZO](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-yellen/bidens-treasury-nominee-yellen-discloses-paid-speaking-gigs-for-financial-firms-idUSKBN2961ZO)

Artificial pre and after market - fines with no transparency (fake numbers reports fines) -- Pattern Day Trading Laws - Settlement periods - **halting** trading of companies just because they feel like it -

SEC allowing hedgefunds to solely run on IBM Watson like software that specifies trade routing systems with data on **trading patterns** while also using that data to make their own trades for profit.

read that last line again.

That is how hedgefunds manipulate and control the ""**FREE MARKET**""

They play the upside and downside of trades, pin the price, and make money both ways by setting algorithms.

the manipulation - has been blatant, glaring and obvious

Hedgefund scare tactics we've seen thus far.

ladder attacks - manipulation of the entire market - synchronized market drops - bot attacks - reverse psychology bots - professional manipulators - stop loss raids - diversion tactics - silver - all the bs.

**DONT FORGET THEY CONTROL THE MEDIA**

[https://techstartups.com/2020/09/18/6-corporations-control-90-media-america-illusion-choice-objectivity-2020/](https://techstartups.com/2020/09/18/6-corporations-control-90-media-america-illusion-choice-objectivity-2020/)

Analysts paid to write shitty articles. ONE PENNY ha how much did that cost?

They never go to fucking jail. 1 guy went to jail in 07/08 housing market collapse

[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html)

How many more of these **Hedgefund Scandals** do we need until **ALL OF THE PEOPLE WAKE UP?**

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Time to shut down their ""free market"" and **Expose the Criminals.**

My favorite movie is Point Break. Ex Presidents exposing the Hedgefund run ""Free Market""

My favorite President JFK.

[https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/starship-gallery/kennedy-podium/](https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/starship-gallery/kennedy-podium/)

“We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.” - JFK

Listen To **JFKs Speech about Secret Societies. The Time is Now.** This is a must watch 5 minute video.

**WE NEED FULL ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION. FREE AND INDEPENDENT.**

[https://preview.redd.it/1kz9nts5yim61.jpg?width=558&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c18aa40a64f7cd6fbbea01ffef9ae6b36e194577](https://preview.redd.it/1kz9nts5yim61.jpg?width=558&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c18aa40a64f7cd6fbbea01ffef9ae6b36e194577)

This is just the start of the largest transfer of wealth the world will ever see.

**Holding until the Free Market is Free.**

The selling of derivative after derivative of phantom shares needs to be accounted for across the entire board and paid in full.

Recently I read the DD of [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) on WSB ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/) ) where he promotes Deutsche Telekom and I am gonna promote that again.

The last couple years Deutsche Telekom has been the most boring stonk you can ever imagine. No volatility at all. BORING. But that is about to change this year. The stonk has potential. When I asked [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) why the stock would change after having a growht of barely 1 euro a year. he answered with the following:

A) Their US subsidiary shows really promising growth figures and a rather high market capitalization (which should reflect in their share price as 43% shareholder as well - at least sooner or later)

B) Finally, the delayed fibre glass rollout in Germany shows some growth and returns

C) Since they are in Germany a de-facto infrastructure monopolist (the competitors need to rent asset usage and maintenance from DTE, 5G is a solid growth driver

TBH these reasons are entirely understandeable and in my opinion corrrect, the results have shown this in their yearly report. A 20% growth in 2020.

Currently the shares are trading at precovid levels without the revenue growth, meaning they are potentially undervalued at this moment from a logical point of view.

Now one of the negative sides of things the user informs us about is debt. Currently Deutsche Telekom has a 100b debt. I disagree about this being a negative thing. As he talks about AT&amp;T I will give AT&amp;T's debt aswell. AT&amp;T's debt is 190B. Other telekom companies have arround the same % of debt. For example the Dutche telekom sector KPN has a market cap of 11B and a debt of 10B. The debt of Deutsche Telekom is not unusual in its sector. If anything, its completely normal.

After consindering all of this I see this stock as a value stock. A stock that has potential growth. And I can see you wondering why does it matter that the stock has changed from dividend stock to value stock? I can tell you thats only because of one reason. Options. Options are fucking cheap. Considering this stock has had no volatility for 20 years means that options are cheap as hell. I bought 100 June 17 2022 options with a strike price of 18 for 50 cents each. Currently they sell for 63 cents and thats still fucking cheap.

Now I do see the stock falling with 60 cents considering the ex dividend date at 29-03-2021. But after that I expect a stable growth to 20+ due to all of the reason mr [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) gives.

Keep in mind the stock currently trades at precovid levels while its revenue went up with 20%, and that 20% revenue growth wasnt expected last year, so it will most likely definetly shoot up.

If you disagree with this DD please tell me why so I can potentially get out of this position :P",Deutsche Telekom,1.0,1615604020,NosPhoenix
