**POSITION 3000 SHARES AT $10.15**

I’ve been saying for years that **the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners.** There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

&amp;#x200B;

**OVERVIEW:**

Owlet Baby Care building the premier baby-tech company with the connected nursery and digital parenting platform as part of the larger ecosystem. Just like Peloton is building a hardware/software/subscription ecosystem for fitness — Owlet is doing the same thing for parents and caretakers.

I’m not a parent so I can’t speak to these topics from personal experience but I have 5 nieces and 4 nephews plus many of my closest friends are parents so I know first hand how obsessed new parents are with their babies and how they are in a constant state of worry and panic. Every time their baby gives them a funny look or starts to cry they begin to freak out. Obviously these fear dissipate over time but how amazing is it that now we have a company like Owlet that is providing the products and services to make the parents job a little easier and less chaotic.

&amp;#x200B;

Owlet has already developed a very strong brand in the baby-tech industry with great retail partnerships, numerous awards and a strong IP portfolio ([patent search on USPTO website](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=owlet&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=owlet)) but going public via $SBG will increase awareness of their products and help them hit their ambitious business goals.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

&amp;#x200B;

Owlet is redefining the way in which parents are supported by technology and empowering them to proactively monitor the health of their newborns to not only protect the baby but also give them piece of mind.

The baby-tech industry is many years behind most consumer tech markets so it’s excited to think that we have a chance to get in early while this trend is just taking off. As you can see below, thousands of babies die every year from SUID (sudden unexpected infant death) and Owlet can help prevent this.

Just like car seats are a must-have product for every parent to keep their baby safe in the car, I expect the Owlet smart sock to keep their baby safe the other 23 hours of the day.

Owlet has a huge lead on other baby-tech companies with their world-class design and engineering team plus years of gathering and analyzing data. They already have 1+ million customers and with the brand loyalty they have developed it now gives them the platform they need to launch new products and expand the ecosystem thus creating more LTV (lifetime value) from each customer.

Let’s also not overlook the fact that 4+ million babies are born every year in the US which give Owlet a constant new supply of customers and their loving parents who want to keep them safe and healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1. current product portfolio
2. product pipeline
3. existing retail distribution with more on the way
4. 1+ million existing customers
5. FDA clinical trials already underway
6. robust R&amp;D process
7. $300+ million on the balance sheet
8. strong brand awareness and NPS scores
9. strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]
10. seasoned management team
11. &amp;#x200B;

**FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

&amp;#x200B;

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.

16,lw5xmr,"A friend of a friend passed on some research he completed on a newly public SPAC that makes very widely applicable, highly biodegradable polymers. This one is worth keeping an eye on I think. Could be a better investment than trying to be the billionth person to find the next Tesla in the litany of EV SPACs. This one is a much better kept secret (for now). Let’s take a look at a few favorable considerations.
 
1.      Manufacturer of biodegradable plastic alternative to traditional plastic food and consumer goods packaging; product named NodaxTM; Nodax PHA produced from canola oil, 100% biodegradable even in oceans, where a lack of bacteria makes it a generally hostile environment to biodegradation (first PHA polymer to be certified as marine degradable) – more environmentally friendly both in manufacturing and disposal, as an alternative to petroleum-based materials

a.      Made by feeding vegetable oil to bacteria, which convert the carbon in the oil to a different form of carbon, PHA; the excess is stored by the bacteria as energy, and can be extracted to make this polymer

2.      Backed by PepsiCo, who pledged to have 100% biodegradable/recyclable/compostable packaging for their snacks business by 2025; test program to supply plastic straws to Dunkin Brands; has signed agreements with PepsiCo, Nestle, Bacardi, as well as plastic goods suppliers

a.      https://www.bioplasticsmagazine.com/en/news/meldungen/20201118-Danimer-Scientific-Eagle-Beverage-partner-on-biodegradable-straws-for-quick-service-restaurants.php

b.      https://www.bioplasticsmagazine.com/en/news/meldungen/20201211-Kemira-Announces-Partnership-with-Danimer-Scientific-to-Develop-Biodegradable-Coating-for-Paper-and-Board-Industry.php

3.      CEO Stephen Croskrey: 500 billion of 800 billion lbs. of plastic made globally every year can be replaced by biopolymers – huge addressable market, lots of room for growth, plenty of room for DNMR and competitors like Cardia Bioplastics

a.      Bioplastics industry expected to grow by almost $6B by 2024, with 18% annual growth rate: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201228005196/en/Insights-on-the-Bioplastic-Packaging-Market-2020-2024-COVID-19-Industry-Analysis-Market-Trends-Market-Growth-Opportunities-and-Forecast-2024---Technavio

b.      Could be even higher with possibility of a lot of government support, esp. in the EU and US

c.       Potential headwind is high manufacturing costs of this type of plastic

4.      Product is fully developed and ready to go, but is at the very beginning of its effort to make a dent in the global packaging industry; could be a good long-term investment

5.      Over 150 patents covering manufacturing and formulations; “Applications for our biopolymers include additives, aqueous coatings, fibers, filaments, films, and injection-molded articles, among others”; also used for disposable flatware, coffee cup waxes, bottle seals, label glue, straws, flexible packaging, other food and beverage containers

6.      Experienced CEO with a proven track record in the industry

7.      Newly public company via Live Oak Acquisition Company (SPAC) in December, 2020 à has financing to expand production capacity to keep up with demand; fully sold out of current manufacturing capacity based on signed and pending contracts

a.      Set to double manufacturing capacity of main Winchester, KY plant by end of 2021

8.      $587M market cap as of 1/2/21; lots of insider buying when it went public

9.      Company founded in 2004

41,lw60lt,"I’ve seen everyone complaining about Robinhood, except for maybe newbies in the stock world, but everyone else here seem to detest RH. Those that are new and are asking themselves why is everyone hating on RH? The reason is for them stopping trades in their app as soon as they got a whiff of everyone buying GME. Now they are doing it regularly whenever they see a stock go high in a short amount of time. This proves that RH is in the pockets of hedge funds who are short selling. Basically putting handcuffs on you when using their app, making you lose a lot of money at times. Beside that they sell all your information you’ve provided, since technically they do not charge anything to use their app. 


The main point - look what we all common people did to GME by the power of unity. If everyone here really hates RH and want to show what united people can do, we should all boycott RH by transferring up to the last penny from your RH account to your bank and deleting your profile/app. This should be coordinated where every single reader in this thread transfers their money and deletes RH on the same day at the same time. Imaging what lesson will be learned from this. This will teach big companies, that common people like us, have a bigger voice and should be for us instead of against us. Most importantly, it will empower all the common folk and show the true power of unity. We the people, united, have the power to change the world and get rid all those rich greedy fucks that are pushing the middle class and lower class against each other. Enough is enough.

57,lw6268,"AMCX has high potential for a short squeeze, \~50% of float is short and moving up, currently at resistance but not selling off. No one is selling which is bad news for bears.

Conditions are right:   
**1) Covering is imminent:**  majority of short positions are red since chart is at a 5 year high and is moving higher  
**2) Fundamentals** are in an uptrend. Pivot  to streaming turnaround story is real and the numbers are showing it. They just had a big earnings EPS beat are getting price target upgrades.   
**3) Value:** AMC networks is responsible for the best show ever create IMO (Breaking Bad) so that is certainly saying something. Breaking Bad is basically about a man fed up with trying to make it in this fucked up crony capitalism experiment we have going. What better a way to put your money where your mouth is than to long the stock that got so many people thinking about this. Do not underplay the cultural changes that Breaking Bad and other AMC content (Mad Men) have brought to our society. WTF were people even talking about before breaking bad, CSI Miami?   
**4) Technicals:** Chart tells me it is currently in the process of squeezing on low volume, if/when volume picks up and attention is brought to this ticker and option volume picks up a gamma squeeze will just add rocketfuel.   
**5) Short Data:** My rough estimate of current total short shares is 8.7M (if the data available to retail traders can be trusted, Yahoo Finance, SCANZ), that is \~$600M (at $70 share price) of short positions which will need to be bought back if this keeps going up. 17M float is what my data is telling me (SCANZ). Daily $volumes are way below $100M atm and shorts just keep adding more. Please tell me what I am wrong about cause I am not well versed in this type of data.

AMCX as a company has created some of the best media content ever created by humans, they are a legitimate undervalued play, they are pivoting their business model and streaming numbers are growing fast. Anyone who thinks a vaccine is somehow going lessen the amount of TV people are watching needs to give their head a shake. A company with this potential should not be \~50% float which means it is realistically setup for a short squeeze if shorts refuse to cover their red positions and continue to average down. Likely this was at one point in time a good short play but the fundamentals have changed and the shorts refused to stop out I will be continuing to pay attention to short numbers as this plays out.

I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this. Also remember to go easy on me cause I am retarded and this is definitely not a suggestion to buy, I just want to be shown how I am wrong so that I don't yolo on this play.

Suggested date: September 2nd, 2021 4pm Eastern Time, 1pm Pacific Time

I’ve seen everyone complaining about Robinhood, except for maybe newbies in the stock world, but everyone else here seem to detest RH. Those that are new and are asking themselves why is everyone hating on RH? The reason is for them stopping trades in their app as soon as they got a whiff of everyone buying GME. Now they are doing it regularly whenever they see a stock go high in a short amount of time. This proves that RH is in the pockets of hedge funds who are short selling. Basically putting handcuffs on you when using their app, making you lose a lot of money at times. Beside that they sell all your information you’ve provided, since technically they do not charge anything to use their app. 


The main point - look what we all common people did to GME by the power of unity. If everyone here really hates RH and want to show what united people can do, we should all boycott RH by transferring up to the last penny from your RH account to your bank and deleting your profile/app. This should be coordinated where every single reader in this thread transfers their money and deletes RH on the same day at the same time. Imaging what lesson will be learned from this. This will teach big companies, that common people like us, have a bigger voice and should be for us instead of against us. Most importantly, it will empower all the common folk and show the true power of unity. We the people, united, have the power to change the world and get rid all those rich greedy fucks that are pushing the middle class and lower class against each other. Enough is enough. 

Other options for trading - Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab. There are more but this are some of the most trusted.

6 months is plenty of time to do what you have to do. If you are on board, please do not let this post die out and spread it as much as possible. WE THE PEOPLE",We The People vs RH,1.0,1614702709,panterachallenger

Listen Gamestop is back baby we got it. We hold and it shall thrive! We need to share the love through AMC as well and back our brothers. Rally together at the popcorn machines. Let butter flow and pump through our veins! Cover our loss in salt then triumph as we eat it up! Sit back and relax as we watch the rocket launch and land on the moon! I picture an opening day show, popcorn flying as the crowd roars with excitement. Thunderous waves heard in the lobby from the claps after launch. Unanimous cheers when we land on the moon.
