The equilibrium of the universe is re-established. Gamestop and Wendy’s open their first shop in Uranus, where Elon Musk successfully teleported all Hedge Fund managers in risk of extinction.

Presiding over the opening of the latest inter-planetary branch of GME, The President of The Galaxy DFV swears in Gabe Plotkin janitor of Uranus’ operations. Across the galaxy, apes rejoice as Gabe utters ”I solemnly swear to keep Uranus clean every single day”.

Paper-handed bitches, now permanent residents of planet Earth look up to the sky for redemption. Had it been fair to give them Vlad’s haircut for eternity? All they did was take profits when it hit the now extinct “USD” 500. All they did was have an exit strategy.

94,m4t58x,"There are 100 shares total.

Some asshole borrowed all 100 shares and sold them to us apes.

We lend out our shares and that asshole who borrows them again and then sells them too us again.

So now they want to cover, and someone owns 100 while we own 200 and the short seller has to buy back 200 shares.

So, the paper handed fool who owns 100 sells to the asshole, so he covers 100 of his shorts at $500/share. But now he has 100 remaining to cover, and we’re not selling for less than $500k/share. So, that’s what he’s got to pay.

Unfortunately though, he only has to cover 100 shares and we have 200. So some of us will sell to the asshole for $500k/share and the rest of us will be left holding the bag.

So, instead of selling all our shares at $500k/share, we all need to sell only 1 shares for $500k, and the next one for $501k and the next one for $502k until they have bought back their 100 shares and were left with 100 shares.
