36,m3drzv,"For our example, let’s say GME only has 2 shares of float (public shares).

Hedgies got greedy and sold 3 naked shorts (when only 2 shares actually exist). Since those were *naked* shorts the 2 shares of float are still available.

Diamond Hand Ape buys 1 of the 2 existing shares and holds it until the end of time itself.

Now there is only 1 available share and still 3 naked shorts who have to cover.

We got ‘em! Right?

Not so fast.

Hedgie A who sold a naked short buys the one remaining share to cover his position. That share effectively transfers to Paper Hand Ape A who bought the borrowed share from Hedgie A originally.

So Hedgie A has covered his short position, taken his loss and he’s out. Cussing those WSB assholes that screwed up his perfectly calculated short play.

The price of GME goes up $20 and Paper Hand Ape A who bought the share from Hedgie A decides to cash in and sell.

It’s good timing because Hedgie B is tired of getting his ass kicked on his short position and needs to close out. He buys the share from Paper Hand Ape A and now he’s covered his short position and he’s out.

The share Hedgie B just bought effectively transfers to Paper Hand Ape B who bought the borrowed share from Hedgie B originally.

Low and behold, GME goes up another $50. Paper Hand Ape B needs to buy a new PS5 to keep busy while his wife is entertaining her boyfriend so he decides to take his profit and sell.

Hedgie C is about to get margin called on his horrific short bet and jumps at the chance to buy the share Paper Hand Ape B just decided to sell.

The deal is done and Hedgie C licks his wounds and covers his position.

If you followed what just happened, all three greedy Hedgies who sold those naked shorts just covered their positions with ONLY 1 SHARE. 

They didn’t need Diamond Hand Ape’s 1 share. He can hold that forever and it doesn’t prevent them from covering.

The simple math is, you can diamond hand your share as long as you want but as long as others are selling (liquidity), shorts can cover.

I’m not saying you can’t make money on GME (I have) and I’m also not saying this gamma squeeze might not go a lot higher. It might. But this concept of an infinite squeeze really doesn’t hold water.

Based on my research a high number of investors is making decisions based on the calculation of Intrinsic value and comparing it to the current stock price.

I don't want to rely just on Reddit or penny stock YouTubers recommendations and I was wondering if there is some tool that could look through all NASDAQ or NYSE stocks, calculate Intrinsic value based on some user parameters, compare it with the current stock price, and generate a list of undervalued stocks. I would use this list of undervalued stocks for detailed analysis and probably will try to invest in those stocks.

I wanted to ask the internet if such a thing exists or if I have to implement such a tool on my own...

I'm prepared to start writing such an application (or some wild google sheet) but I don't want to find out after many hours of programming that such a tool already exists and it's free or for few bucks somewhere on the internet.

Las Vegas — March 8, 2017— JLG Industries, Inc., an Oshkosh Corporation company \[NYSE:OSK\] and a leading global manufacturer of aerial work platforms and telehandlers, announced plans to open its new parts distribution center (PDC) in Las Vegas later this month 

\*\*\*JLG is owned by OSK, the company awarded the USPS contract.

DeJoy stills owns a lot of XPO that works with JLG which is part of OSK which was awarded the USPS contract by DeJoy.  There was a large $54 million block trade made in OSK the day before the contract award.

I've recently started selling call options, mostly because of the tech stocks struggling over the past few weeks and I had a question in regards to selling call options. Instead of selling covered calls, I wanted to learn more about selling Naked Call Options of a stock.

Imagine there is a stock currently trading at $25

I want to sell a Call Option at a strike price of $30 for let's say 0.50 for $50 premium.

If the stock never reaches 30, I keep the premium. WIN!

If the stock nears 30 or goes to 30.10 I could buy the stock at \~$30 and keep premium. WIN!

if I buy the stock at 30 and it drops instantly to 25. I should have sold at 29.95 or at least before 29.5. LOSS.

   if I buy stock at 30 and it rockets to 35...whatever I win my premium.

98,m3ecgd,"Percents are useful when you are measuring fractional gains. Big numbers are a pain to describe in fractions. If your gains are a big number, it would be appropriate to describe it in integers. 

So instead of posting how you got 42069.69% gains, you can just say you went up 420x. Way easier. But wait—you say we need to still see the 69–read on. 

What if people need to think bigger. Just in general. Like Texas doughnuts. Now, don’t listen to me because I am an autist who can’t read, BUT I heard another ape grunting about some biiiig numbers. Maybe 42069*x* might be more accurate for his bananas. 

Also this is not financial advice, I am a retarded ape who has to draw with bananas because I always eat all my crayons.","All you pussies measuring in % instead of *X*. I’ll have one 42069x for my portfolio, to stay. And some crayons for an appetizer",1.0,1615542479,brandoncrapo
