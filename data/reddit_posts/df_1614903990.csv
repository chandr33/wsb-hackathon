What do yall think? On one hand, this feels really out of Squares vertical and I worry that management isn't focused on rolling out the things that investors like... Square Capital just launched.. that makes sense and I've wanted them to vertically integrate small business financing for a long time. Tidal feels nothing like that. 

On the other hand, maybe its groundwork for something more disruptive? Off the top of my head, I could see some sort of deal for artists like ""use Square for your payment processing on merch and you'll get a premium artist experience on Tidal... increased royalties from streaming, merch on artist page, micro-transactions, etc""... or maybe something aimed at restaurant industry. ""If you use Square for your POS and payment processing, you get royalty free access to the entire Tidal catalog to play music in your club""... music licensing for venues aint cheap.

So I could see it being a terrible idea or a great idea... not sure how it changes my outlook on the stock. I do think Square is really well run, but Dorsey is also the guy who thought he could make money off of Vine. Curious to see what some on this board think.",Thoughts on $SQ acquiring Tidal?,0.58,1614904232,Shart4

72,lxzyzn,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,0.52,1614905236,Catinzahat

I now have about 1,000 shares at an average strike price of $330 (wish I had bought more, haha). Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten. I'm also not prepared to buy a whole bunch more TSLA because I need diversity in my investments at my age and I am probably a bit overweighted with this single stock. BUT, I still want to play. In preparation for this playtime, I've opened a margin and options account with my broker.

Hypothetically, if I believed that TSLA stock would trade at or above $720 per share on or before May 14, 2021, and hypothetically, if I was willing to risk 100 of my 1,000 shares on that prediction, is there an options contract I could create to capitalize?
