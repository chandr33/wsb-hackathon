40,m16e6q,"I've had to help a few friends with this recently, and also saw some comments of people asking about it on some WSB posts. And I haven't found a post relating specifically to this issue on WSB, so here is some info that I think will be helpful! (I also tried commenting on those individua comments, but couldn't because of low Karma).

\---First, RH's default ""Partial-Margin"" account status---  
By default, all new RH accounts are considered what they call ""partial-margin,"" which is technically a margin account as far as other brokerages are concerned. And you do NOT have to have GOLD with them to be considered as this ""partial-margin"" account.

The importance of this fact is that if your other brokerage account is a cash account, **your portfolio transfer will fail/cancel because the account types are not matching**.

There is a possibility that this is a relatively newer thing they implemented, so if you've had RH for a while, your account could still be a cash account.

If you want to double check and see for yourself, you can see either an order confirmation or an account statement on Robinhood, and you'll see a little ""M"" next to your account; which the lexicon at the bottom of the page defines as margin.

\---How to downgrade RH from ""Partial-Margin"" to Cash---  
Unfortunately they don't make this process easy, and there's no button or link you can use to downgrade. You will have to message support directly, stating along the lines of:  
""I would like to downgrade my account to a cash account please. I also understand that I am not guaranteed to be able to re-upgrade my account on a future date.""

They will take a couple days to process the request. Then, you can initiate the transfer.

\---Regarding transfer fees---  
I've also been seeing a lot of comments about how people are being charged $75 transfer fees by RH. A lot (if not most) brokerages will actually cover the fee for you. When you call the new brokerage to initiate the transfer, just mention and ask if they will reimburse the fee charged by RH. They'll just ask for a copy of the RH statement showing the $75 fee, and reimburse it. **This is the case even if there is no official promo listed on their website**, though I couldn't find hard data on whether the value of the assets being transferred has to be above a certain amount; YMMV.","Helpful info on transferring out of Robinhood (default ""partial-margin"" accounts)",1.0,1615296571,cwamoon

53,m16fmf,"So its safe to say I'm a little sceptical, IPO's are generally a good idea when you have a prosperous and new company that needs public investment in order to expand, Reddit however is not new and I would argue past its peak in terms of user investment and utility.

Furthermore Reddit is currently in the process of purging any subs and content that could possibly give it a bad name, a new automated system just today accidently banned r/Pics, r/AskHistorians and r/videos, that's the whole subs, mega subs, subs with exemplar moderation in the eyes of the admins, that got banned momentarily, and the admins seem like they unbanned them purely because the subs were large and popular.

The Admins seem out of touch in the extreme as they continue to purge and censor using their unpaid slave moderators as human shields for their own ideological views. the complaints against the moderator system based on its inability to cope with said ideological disagreements and ZERO accountability of moderators to their audiences have never been addressed.

It just seems to me like reddit is past its prime and an IPO at this stage for me does not have good long term prospects thanks to a bevy of unaddressed long standing issues with the core moderation system that are becoming more and more noticeable by the day and the admins complete disregard and ignoring of this problem in favour of expanding the social media aspects of the site is a clear example of how out of touch they are. Reddit is not a social media, its more of a social forum and the difference is absolutely vital yet the admins don't seem to understand at all.

So that's my completely unstatistical, unsolicited, not financial opinion.

Good Morning,

The music to this post is **Diamond** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.

I own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..

**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.

I will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.

Before we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?

Poser.

**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**

**Good news -**

u/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.

[https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png](https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png)  \- Ortex Stats

**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\*cough Cough\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\*cough cough\***

**Short Utilization** \- 100

**On Loan -** 7.29M

**Short Interest** \- 8.9 M

**Cost to borrow** \- 7.5

**Average age on loan** \- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28

What we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But that's the hopium read.

Or they are could just be reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list... Premarket looks great just sayin....

**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...

**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**

Again, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...

# Why Canoo?

**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**

I spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.

Please see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.

/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted ""According to a recent [Mckinsey study, ""The New Realities of Premium Mobility,""](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""

But what about EV's in General.

Another [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.

1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.
2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.
3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \*
4. Affordability is coming.\*
5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \*
6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \*
7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*

We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.

Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.

Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  ""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""

He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.

Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?

Why am I breathing hard?

I just got done moving some goalposts.

What might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.

This shit is wild.

75,m16izk,"I received many questions about the method which I employ during a parabolic event specific to GME. In this case, we use GME in the PM, we see that 1 small parabolic event has occurred. The 1st arrow places the bar at the rise, the 5th notes the optimal height and the 6th is the downward slope. There have been questions about the inclusion of red bars. Disregard those in a parabolic event. This behavior is specific to GME. I challenge any who may want to employ this method to go back in time and review GME and the parabolic activity and follow the method as described.

To meet the criteria, the event must have an RSI of 70+.

Happy Trading!
