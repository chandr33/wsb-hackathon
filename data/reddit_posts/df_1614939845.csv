InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. provides hearing aids and its hearable, and wearable personal sound amplifier products to retail hearing aid dispensing community. The company engages in the provision of manufacturing and direct-to-consumer distribution/retail of hearing aids, personal sound amplifier products, hearing related treatment therapies, doctor-formulated dietary hearing supplements, and proprietary CDB oil for treating tinnitus. It also owns and operates 11 audiological and retail hearing device clinics; and offers business to business SaaS based patient management system software program.

They've ready partnered with wal-mart since¬† 2018 &amp; expected¬† upcoming announcements with other major retailers. They already have their own¬† E-commerce website¬† nohasslehearing.com, and have both business to business, as well business to customer models.¬†

Recently announced completion of FDA Medical device registration on their new line of products - Self-fitting Self-adjusting hearing aids¬†

¬†INND grew revenues by 318% year on year in 2020, while hearing aid sales as a whole dropped 18% over the same period.¬†

Demand for hearing products over the past year has been pushed down due to Covid. Delays in both updating of the guidelines for OTC hearing aids, as well as reduced in person audiologist visits caused an 18% reduction in overall sales in 2020. With the new guidelines under the OTC Hearing Aid Act expected any day now, and demand pushed back due to the effects of Covid-19, 2021 should see a strong rebound in hearing product sales on the back half of the year.¬†


Recent passage of legislation allowing OTC sales of hearing aids will remove barriers for consumers to get the devices at an affordable cost &amp; without relying on expensive audiologist visits to replace hearing devices.¬† This will allow new companies with innovative solutions to disrupt the industry, and take market share from other major manufacturers, while filling need left largely ignored by technological advancements over the past decades.¬†

Estimated CAGR 7-8% for hearing aid sales.¬†
8.99 billion in U.S. hearing aid/ psap sales¬† in 2019, projected to reach 13.38 billion by 2027.¬†
An estimated 37.5 million American adults report some level of hearing loss or difficulties.¬† Only 4.23 million units were sold in the U.S. 2019.¬†
About 18 percent of adults aged 20-69 have speech-frequency hearing loss in both ears from among those who report 5 or more years of exposure to very loud noise at work, as compared to 5.5 percent of adults with speech-frequency hearing loss in both ears who report no occupational noise exposure.



Putting all of these factors together I believe INND will continue to take market share from larger manufacturers over the coming decade and provide value to both shareholders and customers. I like the stock. I believe it's undervalued. But I'm just a retard with a smart phone,  what do I know.",One dumb mooks case for INND,0.99,1615128075,mimocid

79,lzsgw7,"Morning. I‚Äôm learning about options and would appreciate some insight.

Say that 10,000 apes buy 1 in the money call option that expires Friday.

All 10,000 apes exercise that call option at 12pm Friday.

Hedgies are required to purchase - assuming they don‚Äôt already own shares - 10,000 x 100 shares to satisfy the contracts. (1,000,000 shares)

A 1 million share purchase would cause a price spike bc high demand.

And, assuming the price spike is significant, that would turn out-of-the-money calls into in-the-money calls.

Which, the new in-the-money calls could exercise, force a purchase, create another price spike, and thus continue the chain.

This would force hedgies to buy shares which would combat against their own short selling, right? And also accelerate a potential short squeeze?

Of course, this speculation assumes that hedgies must deliver shares immediately upon exercising a call option. Are they instead obligated by t+2? Even if the exercise occurs early in the day? On a Monday?

Thanks for the education in advance.

I know many of you are more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.

# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain ü¶ç)

There are two types of squezzes:

* short squezze
* gamma squezze

**Short squezzes:**

Evil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --&gt; Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/).

**Gamma squezzes:**

Evil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.

If you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.

What you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.

# Applying this to the current GME situation

**Short squezze:**

Im sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).

^(1: 01/14/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

^(2: 02/11/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)

*""But there was no volume?"".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.

^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)

^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN)

*""But what is with the institutional ownership?""* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said ""Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest."" (e. g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.

^(5:) [^(Finra)](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)

With that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.

^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https://etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

**Gamma squezze:**

A gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.

*So how can ü¶çü¶çü¶ç profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.

^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)

*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:

&gt;*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*

So these are probably numbers we need to see again.

^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)

*So whats the current situation with GME options?*

For the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.

^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jm8qjkjveml61...*

But for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.

&amp;#x200B;

[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03\/19](https://preview.redd.it/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb)

I may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.
