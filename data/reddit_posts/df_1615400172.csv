Please please remember to not invest more than you can lose.  That limit is what people refer to as ""risk tolerance.""  While it's not common for established companies to go bankrupt, it happens, and should be taken into account.

For anyone who put in beyond their risk tolerance and got out with minimal losses (or even some gains), congrats!  The relief is real.  I am genuinely happy for those that got their YOLO back.

If you did get your money back, please remember that such percentage losses and gains as these almost never happen this quickly.  Just because a market anomaly gave you your money back doesn't mean it'll happen again.  The moral hazard here too is real.

82,m24ghn,"Why March 19th is Important and Why we need to hold until then. 

Literally 4 x the puts are going to expire march 19th. So they either need to buy calls or shares before then to hedge against those puts they took out because at this point all they are doing is decaying. And at this rate they will be worth almost nothing by now. This is the theory I have and its clearly coming true

Options expire on March 19th. All we need to do is litterally hold past that date. 4 x the amount of options will be expiring this time. Which means anyone why bought puts will be forced to buy calls the hedge their loss on the put options that will be expiring on the 19th. Then this shit will be going way higher than it did last time. At least 4 x higher. So about 1200 a share we should see on GME. Check the options chain for MArch 19th. Thank me after. Just do yourself a favor and get in while you still can

There are actually puts about to expire on the 12 of March as well. So it will be back to back weeks of expiring options. Buy your shares now and enjoy they ride. As you can see word is getting around and they have begun the war
