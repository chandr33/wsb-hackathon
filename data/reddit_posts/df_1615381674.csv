At this price point, most of us had averaged down and are in the green. What do you guys think about exit strategy? Do we sell out our initial investment and keep riding with our profits? Do we just stay all in and ride or die?

48,m1x7w1,"TLDR: Deregulation in gambling and low cost customer acquisition makes GNOG a great value play in the gambling space. 

I am long 20 Jan 2022 calls with a strike price of $20 along with 1650 shares. 

$GNOG inked a deal last week with Tioga Downs in NY which will be the largest addressable market in the US for igaming until Cali deregulates. 

This is the 9th state that GNOG has gained access to and will continue to see more and more states open up due to lack of revenue from COVID. 

The TAM is estimated to be in the $20-$30 billion range over the next 5 years. While GNOG doesn’t have the same market share as DKNG and the other market leaders. It has carved out a stead 8-9% market share. 

Competition is heating up as the online gambling market is opening up and I believe that Tillman will leverage his customer loyalty at Golden Nugget and cross sell with his Landry’s brands similar to how DKNG does with its daily fantasy customers. 

Texas, yesterday, announced bipartisan legislation to open up gambling and sports betting. While the process will likely take a year minimum to go through the regulatory hurdles, it is continuing the trend of states actively looking at these types of avenues to increase state revenue lost during Covid. 

The stock has sold off 50% since December and I believe this is a great value play in this space.",$GNOG,1.0,1615382121,TheBanker89
