38,mg7div,"Ok 2 things - very simple. 


1. MS sold out of 1/2 billion shares of RKT at 25.25. Why they sold? They probably have a set plan so sell in increments at set prices, they are rotating some money around because of margin call shenanigans, or they want to keep accumulating at lower prices so they made a public scare. 

2. The closed above the 8, 20, and 50 EMA on the 4 hour chart. Last time it did that we saw 70% gains. 

Ok 3 things. We know they will beat ER again and drop some partnership again probably. They are going to get recognized as more than a mortgage company because they can make money when rates are up and down due to their tech. Next Er should prove this. 

I can’t seem to think as to why this sell by MS is bad.

On a more macro level, you could say consumer lending stocks could dip hard I guess. I don’t believe this matters. Not only are they not just a mortgage company, but they are a safe play even if they were only a mortgage company because of their ability to utilize tech in high rate environments. Additionally, MBS’s are actually crash proof now IMO, especially with RKT’s securitized loans. (They write clean loans which get sold as a portfolio in the secondary market.) People pay their mortgages as a priority, and it’s not pre Dodd Frank Act anymore so you actually have to qualify thoroughly.  

Ok, let’s say everyone losses their job and can’t pay their mortgage and RKT goes bankrupt... The funny part is we would probably get over $300 a share due to the amount of assets they have. It’s comical, that’s literally how undervalued this company is - According to the stock market they are worth more bankrupt then being fully operating business generating nearly half $1 trillion in revenue in one year (according to their annual report) while rapidly growing/innovating. 

I can’t seem to think as to why this sell is a bad. At the end of the day someone bought the shares above 25 while the price sits at 23.8.  

Pos: 2k shares and a total of like 250 calls or something - I lost count.

TL:DR: I am going to BUY end of Month APRIL call contracts after 1-2% drop from 4/1 open. YOLO Stim money. 

Rule one of forecasting:  

***PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T A INDICATOR OF FUTURE RESULTS.***

So you all saw the Graph telling you April is the best time to buy as it shows a 2% gain on average. While this is true what is left out is why April is higher. The reason April is higher is because it is were a lot of the bounce backs have occurred in April while March tends to suck.

I went and pulled all of Spy from 1993 to 2021 and this is what I found.

Spy mostly ends up back were it started between open and close but has large swings between days.

The months with the highest ratios being positive tends to be April and November for the data set as shown below.

https://imgur.com/a/ok7lAu1

As you can see from 1993 through 2020 April still had some red months but is it is mostly green dildos. 

Here is the actual Avg % gain between the first of the month and end of the month from 1993-2021 excluding outliers like the crash of 2020 in march and the recovery in April. Anything outside of -9% and 10% was an outlier.

https://imgur.com/a/H6EGgLS

Included is the avg % difference between the months lowest point and opening price for the month.

https://imgur.com/a/7xn5s9A

For the most part April stands a really good chance of being green but don't buy any options until SPY is below what ever it is going to be on 4/1 by 1-2% as current option contacts by the end of April have to move 1.5-2% for you to just break even. 

April tends to only increase by ~1.5% by close on 4/30.

 For you smooth brains this means you are likely fucked if you buy EOM contracts the first of the month. So wait for red day and then buy and enjoy the ride. 

If you time the lowest price in April the likely max price change you can get by the end of the month is 4% but there are years were it went up 8%.

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.

**PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**

https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors

“AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 

**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB **

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19 

https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-agreement-us-government-supply-300000-vials

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)
