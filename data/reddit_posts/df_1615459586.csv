Don't be surprised if we hover around - 10% during premarket. Wouldn't it be terrible if we had another 10% dip on yesterday's close....... Or maybe fantastic as we'd have another day of SSR rules tomorrow. I would never suggest anyone in the hedge fund industry is doing this on purpose because no doubt everything is done above board.

Now I'm off to find some crayons to chew on.

Remember the other day I posted for people to remind family members that might be investing with a lot of these big brokers and hedge funds whatever it may be that they might be invested in 401k, we got to remember them,  just tell them to look at their portfolios please. A buddy of mine thank goodness he looked at his because he realized it has gone down 25% in last 3 weeks and I'm not going to name the company's he's with, cuz he still has his money invested by them, he did tell me but it's not about that, it's about making people aware of the situation and what is going on and I thank you guys because you got to think of others while you're prospering, others are getting their ass whooped, like we've been for a long time. I still am but that's okay it's not about me.

Now this is what I feel is very important and I'll leave this up for a discussion and hopefully we can accomplish what I'm thinking of and I have a way that all this can play into our favor even quicker and faster. Two things I think it's all we need to do:

1) all right a little note that explains what these hedge funds have been doing to mislead all the public so that people sell or not buy at all so they can recoup their money and put out these fake bitchass stocks to try and dilute so it hurts us... it hurts people like (I hate to say me again but I'm doing the options, so I buy 2 weeks out every week but for them not paying and them not honoring their end by taking these stocks and borrowing them and then selling them shorting them and then reselling them and basically they're loaning out s*** that ain't theirs or that's not available that's not real, so for them doing that, they get to screw people like me that's carrying 30 to 70 options a week... 

2)  okay then I will add with it or what I'm asking the community for, is to look for things that people have been posting or revealed misleading info to the public doing for instance, Bots saying something but something different is happening , or something huge from the HEDGIES puting out misleading info, News Cast misleading, or large firms that are all involved in shorting. But the first thing is I would like to have like five sectors of proofs of their corruption or they're misleading information to the public to convince them to walk away from AMC.

So lies or misleading information from the following:
 
1) News Cast
2) Hedge Funds 
3) Brokers
4) Radio
5) News Adds 
6) Bots 

Today was a crazy day and I think it can get even crazier... if I can get this help and get this done before Friday morning ,  then I send it up to you guys whoever thinks we can change this or change that or whatever I don't care I'm open I'm a team player but I think we need so we can Mass produce it....
One thing that is psychological is when you see a photo one time cool when you see it twice huh a third time is this a coincidence and then 5 10 15 100 times that's what this can do if we can dig up some really cool info to provide to those on the edge that don't have the confidence to stay and hold not sell. And to reassure all them and those that may not be on here with us we can still reach out to them through all of us. Thanks guys let me know what you think add to the link here let's roll on this let's get some info out to people so that they're convinced to hold on to these stocks and then if I need some help buying some of these options but I'm going to buy some more but let's buy some bye bye bye....

37,m2npyk,"GTT is a shitty ass company but that doesn't mean we can't make some fat stacks.

In May 2018 GTT bought Interoute for like 2.3bn dollars. They purchased Interoute mostly for their fiber network - for some reason GTT threw out all the other stuff the company were working on which actually had some pretty huge potential in SDWAN. 

Fast forward to today, GTT is a shitty company so they need to sell Interoutes fiber network assets which cover most of Europe. The value of the network is close to 2.1bn dollars. 

Current market cap: $143m
GTT stock price: $2.43
GTT Stock price around time of Interoute purchase: $50-60

Basically it comes down to this. If GTT sell Interoute fiber, then there stock will pop the fuck off ($15-20 dollars minimum) to restore there market cap to a sane level. 

I think they will sell the fiber network. Yesterday the stock popped 30% moving from an average volume of 3 million shares to (according to yahoo) 47m yesterday (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GTT/). There has been no new news, fellow apes - so why the fuck did GTT jump 30% yesterday?

Two options:
 - Insiders know the deals done to sell the old Interoute Fiber network and they're buying stock like hell.
 - Insiders know that there's going to be a buyout of GTT.

Either way we can't fucking lose.

TLDR: Buy GTT at open

The company said it had priced 130 million shares at $35 apiece, raising $4.55 billion and valuing the company around $60 billion. That makes Coupang the largest IPO in the U.S. this year and one of the top 25 biggest listings of all time stateside, by deal size.

The price is also above the company's most recent expected range of between $32 and $34 a share.

Market leader

the valuation and IPO price likely rose because Coupang is the only e-commerce company in South Korea that showed a sizeable gain in market share last year.
