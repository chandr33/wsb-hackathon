45,lwzqjb,"Hey all, lurking ape here taking a stab at using the brain. Probably totally wrong and this is certainly not financial advice. 

Like many other apes, I love to smoke weed and of course love to support weed stocks. That being said, I‚Äôve been following them for a while and personally believe that Sundial Growers (SNDL) is undervalued. 

SNDL came out at $13.01 in August 2019 and swiftly dropped down to under a dollar.

The company has a strong supply chain and is one of the best positioned to take on the demand from a national legalization, which will happen eventually. 

On top of that, the CEO said months ago that they would be expecting significant growth that would be represented in the Q1 2021 earnings report. They are announcing 2020 financial results on March 17th and then holding a conference call / webcast the following day. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/sundial-growers-announce-full-fourth-120000058.html

66,lwzsyd," **Everyone** needs to pay attention to what's going on here. I'm talking about a global reset of precious metals, most importantly Gold and Silver. If you are skeptical, I guarantee it is simply because you have yet to do your own due diligence so far. When futures contracts on the COMEX go into backwardation, you know something has broken. This has already happened once in February and is likely again. the Big Guys are trying to force people out of paper Gold and Silver.

The deadline is 28 June 2021, which is when the NSFR goes into effect. Do your research.

I'm not at all suggesting to put all your eggs into one basket, but you should be aware of what's going on here (big banks trying to crush small guys because they are at risk of losing trillions, yes TRILLIONS).

NSFR is a requirement for all the global Central Banks. the exact details are explained in the Basel III requirements. there are multiple dates involved with Basel III, but the deadline for the NSFR is 27 June. So on 28 June, Gold and Silver will be repriced to match the true price, which has never happened. There is likely to be a run up the month prior as well.

Long term, this is good for providing stability to the world's central banks (like the U.S. Federal Reserve), but the ""smaller"" banks, like Goldman Sachs, BoA, LBMA, JPM, etc, will be banged up along they way as they drastically try and cover their short positions or other positions not equally weighted to Gold, prior to the reevaluation of Gold and Silver. Just watch. These big banks wont benefit much from additional short selling either. Gold is already at a very technical low, matching the technical low in late 2018. What the CEOs of GS and JPM are going to be doing, and have been doing, is playing down Gold and Silver to the public, while purchasing it in the background.

Stay informed, and good luck.",UPDATE: Gold Silver Basel III and NSFR,0.65,1614793607,m756615
