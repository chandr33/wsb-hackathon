Ok retards. So I was one of the apes who bought GME during the first squeeze, and instead of holding or selling at the top, I sold and lost my life changing gains by selling at the absolute bottom of almost $40. So naturally this didn’t bode well with me, but I have a really really good idea.

So I have decided here and now that I will take out the biggest, juiciest, fattest loan and I’m gonna YOLO all of it on GME. Now I know what you’re thinking, I’m completely retarded, and you’re right, I definitely have a few extra chromosomes than the majority of you apes. But this plan is foolproof, I have no debt, I have good credit, and I simply don’t give a fuck because this literally can’t go tits up. 

I’ll either retire early or “retire early” if u catch my drift so it’s a win win either way. I’ll update you guys as soon as I can find the meatiest loan to yolo into GME and I’ll see you guys in my million dollar mansion and Tesla in a few weeks. Also if GME breaks 700 I’ll go into GameStop and buy every PS5 in stock and give away every single one of them.

The tendies you about to make 

There is no lie that we have been convinced 
That we the people need yearly updates on new products.
Every year every market from cars to techs and more
Come out with a ""slightly"" better improvement then the last 
You see where I am going with this .... 

Look how we handle our children desires when we they want the new best thing 
See how you look out for your kid ?
Some of us can't afford it.
Some can but refrain ..or some just do it to see them happy. 
(Why can't the system we have accepted not look out for us in the same way how we look out for our own )

Let's imagine this .... 
Let's substitute internet ads tv ads irl ads 
For physical salespeople  that come and knock on your home door 

One day I counted 150 + or - 5 ( lost count at one point lol)
a combination of ads mentioned above.. 

Now imagine a salesperson knocking on your door for the equal amount of times you see an add.. 
I think we all know how we would get
What type of people would do that to their civilization ?

They have conditioned us for generations to think that 
what they provide is the way.
When is not true what they provide is a controlled environment dedicated to making you spend your money on nonsense. 
And in the proccess destroy your human body with unhealthy food drinks and habits 
And any mention of the truth our deep ecology of existence is dubbed right away or hidden from the public.



Some of us are fortunate to have navigated on their lands and acquired wealth 
And although you may not see the struggle's happening from your current sleeping courters 
But you can hear that faint cry and read their story's. It is fine to turn a cheek  and say hey it wasn't easy for me either but i made it shut up And pull your own weight But it does not change the fact that you represent a small percentage that is happy 
In the world the rest my friend is all sad and sad is an understatement with some of these countries current state.





It's like this the whole world is at a restaurant and we all decide that we don't want nothing on the menu
Everything on the menu is unhealthy. 

So we persist  on a new menu 
They respond with 
hey across the street there is a restaurant and they sell some healthy stuff 
Half of the group leaves and only to find out when they enter the other res
They have 90% unhealthy and 10% healthy food choices 

Store clerk says hey down the block there is a store pretty known 
Half of that group leaves and the other stay to buy that from the 10% menu 
The other group finds the store down the block 
And check the menu 50% healthy 

They feast .. after they head to the 1st restaurant 
To meet with everyone only to find that group that stayed to demand better food still hasn't eaten
They comment hey there's 10% across the street and 50% down the block I thi king we can live with that

They reply no we have to remain strong they will budge and every restaurant will serve 100% healthy food in time ..
after some years people start leaving the 1st restaurant and slowly the numbers crumble to a point where the few that are left 
their voices are still heard across the internet but we dubbed them as crazy people filled with conspiracy theories. 

You see what I did there.. 

Years passed and we have forgotten our ways and have surrendered to the system/ own habbits

Slowly that compassion that fired those dubbed crazy people
Is being spread and used by all apes 
We have embraced and accepted what we are 
And we all stand united against set forces at hand

🚀 Zoom Video Communications says its mission is ""to make video communications frictionless,"" which it
seeks to accomplish with a unified, video-first communications platform that incorporates video, voice,
chat, and content sharing. The company offers a differentiated peer-to-peer technology, complete with
proprietary routing technology. Zoom is a recognized market leader in meeting software and is
disrupting and expanding the $43 billion video conferencing market with its ease of use and superior
user experience. Zoom has product and technology advantages, but there may not be 
enough for a moat at this stage in its life cycle.
Zoom relies mainly on a low-touch e-commerce model that lends itself to viral adoption, but it has also
established a direct salesforce to gather and serve larger, more strategic customers. The company has
been adept at adding users, especially during COVID-19-induced lockdowns, and it also has several
related products to upsell. Zoom has already produced a full year of GAAP
profitability, and has seen quarterly non-GAAP operating margin top 40%.
With the recent introduction of Zoom Phone, which it does not plan to sell to customers who do not
already have Zoom Meetings, the portfolio is expanding meaningfully. The company’s focus is squarely
on adding as many users as possible. This starts with generating buzz and familiarity with free users,
while the direct salesforce sells to enterprise accounts. Customers are growing rapidly, with larger
customers numbering more than 988, while smaller customers total approximately 370,000.

🚀

🚀

🚀

🚀  Revenue grew 369% year over year to $882 million, which topped the high end of guidance of $811
million. Demand remains robust as Zoom continues to gather new customers, which continue to
contribute more to revenue growth than existing customers are--unusual for a software company of
Zoom’s size. Demand remains strong across all verticals and customer sizes, which was initially
pandemic-driven but is resulting in dee okper walled penetration at larger paying customers. Customers with more than $100,000 in trailing annual revenues accelerated meaningfully once again to 156% year-
over-year growth to 1,644. Clearly larger customers added meaningfully to their seat count, but small
customers contributed 37% of revenue, up from around 20% over the last couple years. As the world
opens back up from COVID-19 over the next several quarters, management expects churn to be elevated
from its 4% monthly historical norm, but notes that turnover has been better than expected over the last
couple quarters and net dollar expansion remains strong.

🚀  According to Morningstar, fair value estimate for Zoom is $223 per share, which implies a fiscal 2022 enterprise value/sales
multiple of 17 times, adjusted price/earnings multiple of 60 times, and a 1.5% free cash flow yield.
Despite the substantial model reset higher after the April 2020 quarter, multiples remain near the top
end of the range for software companies.
There are two related controversies surrounding the stock: 1) how rapidly will the user base
grow and 2) how long robust growth can continue. Forecasts suggest aggressive growth continuing in the coming
years and model total revenue growth in excess of 40% in fiscal 2022, decelerating to 20% in fiscal
2026, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate of 26%. Revenue will shift more
toward existing customers over time, and solutions beyond Zoom Meetings (Rooms, Connector,
OnZoom, Zapps, and Phones) will increase within the mix. Models estimate non-GAAP operating margin
actually contracting modestly from 37% in fiscal 2021 (actual) but still remaining in the mid 30% area
through fiscal 2026.
In its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion
by 2022, based on data from IDC. This market is likely growing at approximately 3% annually, with a
clear shift toward cloud-based solutions like Zoom’s. Management further believes that Zoom’s
opportunity is larger, especially after blowout results throughout fiscal 2021, as video penetration can
increase materially as users experience the ease of use and robust features the platform offers. Phone systems make up the lion’s share of this total market, with conferencing (including
video conferencing) accounting for 10%-15% of the total.

Both the Zoom user base and the company’s revenue have grown rapidly and are expected to continue
to do so over the next several years.
Zoom offers a disruptive technology that is designed from the ground up as a video-first collaboration
platform. Customer satisfaction is well above video conferencing peers. Zoom’s low-touch, low-friction model should eventually drive strong margins. The company has already
produced a full year of positive GAAP profitability, which is well ahead of other high-growth software
peers
