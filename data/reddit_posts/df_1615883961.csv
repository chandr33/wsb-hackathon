4,m64gyw,"""Een kat in het nauw maakt rare sprongen"". This is a Dutch saying, literally translated: ""a cat in trouble performs weird jumps"". In other words: There's no¬†telling what someone will¬†do¬†when they are pushed¬†to the edge.

I am a Dutch information security officer working for a large company where I try to keep the company safe by spreading the word and enforcing cybersecurity. I'm not sure if I was the only one who experienced it yesterday, but after the US market closed I had some issues with Reddit being partially unavailable and slow loading times. This made me realize that I need to prepare my mind for the potential moment, probably right for the squeeze, that Reddit might be down because of a Distributed Denial of Service (D)DoS attack. for you apes who are not that much into IT, that means that somebody manages to overload servers of a website, platform, whatever, resulting into them being unavailable or shutting down for  a specific amount of time. As I know that it is not too difficult to find a botnet for hire (google is your friend) on the darknet (no Google there), I am keeping in the back of my mind that the cat (hedge funds) might make some weird jumps right before the MOASS unleashes it's gloriousness. Even though I am very sure Reddit has proper protection against (D)DoS attacks, I am also very aware how much money those cats are willing to spend when pushed to the edge, like we see happening daily with the short attacks. So I am preparing myself for the possibility of Reddit being unavailable, right before this rocket is taking off into the vast nothingness of space. I am preparing for the potential moment of not knowing what others are doing or lacking the possibility to read DD right at that moment.

Long story short: prepare your mind for the possibility of being offline from Reddit right before or during the MOASS and keep calm. Focus on your own goal. You don't need Reddit to hold!

Good luck apes, see you in space!

This is not financial advice Yadayada

11,m64mrk,"Ignorance is bliss - Why I fear we Apes are going down like harambe.üòî

Unfortunately Apes IMO we have been bitch slapped. I have done my OWN DD and have read DD on WSB and GME for the last 2 months every post you can think of.. I've ridden GME to the heavens and back down to the depths of hell. I am not a fresh smooth brain, there are fucking scars on my face from this battle. I own shares and calls currently.What I am about to explain to you makes more sense than any DD I have read, or will read on these subs.

I'm not going to link a fucking SA I'm going to make this so simple to understand.. We are fucking idiots.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Let me set the scene.. So you cucks understand. Melvin did get fucked.. Shorts did get killed and billions were lost.. We apes bitch slapped them.. We won.. GME 450 bitches..... DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS l, and then we saw truly what they are made of.. THEY TURNED OFF THE FUCKING BUY BUTTON.. They have no rules.. They can do whatever they want.. They look at us apes as peasants, they run this country, they run our government and they run YOU and I 

Do you really think they are shaking in their boots!??? Do you really think Citadel is worried? If you do, you are wrong... They are laughing at us and here is why. 


First off, in the first GME run hedgies made BILLIONS just so you understand. At first the got caught, but afterwards the shorts cleaned the fuck up. $450 to $40? Easy gains. Also, they got it up to $450, not us. After $200 our buying power is trash tier let alone $300, $350, $400 and $450.They pushed it up to get all of us Apes ALL IN and feeling bullet proof. Once we are ALL IN? Simple, shut off the buying button FUCKING AGAIN and short the shit out of it until we can't fucking see straight. BOOM, BILLIONS MADE AGAIN. FML. Once again they have no rules. Your short reports, I use to roll fat blunts with. 

A FUCK TON WAS LEARNED. GME has a cult like following that are made up of down right SAVAGES that will fucking NEVER sell. As a matter of fact, if there is ANY sign of a moon launch to the moon, THEY WILL ALL BUY MORE. 

Opportunity. 

I'm a hedgie, I have billions üòè. I want to make the cult wake the fuck up after a month of nothing so I can make some more money! Would you look at that, DFV at congress says he still likes the stock and not only does he like it he, doubled the fuck down. This is perfect. Cost to short, super low at $40 and unlimited shares to short, because guess what, I can do whatever I want with zero fucking repercussions. I don't have any rules, so you know what, DFV I agree! I like the stock too.. I'm going to buy X million shares and push this bitch from $55-$100. I'll bet Reddit goes fucking nuts. I'll bet every Tom dick and Harry jump right on board and all of them go back in even harder than ever. You know what, fuck it, instead of shilling GME we will post DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS. WE WILL POST HOLD THE LINE, we will post feel good cock fluffing shit about why all apes should be on this ship headed to the moon. This way when they are all in again and the stock hits say 350, I will start shorting and sell Xmillion shares and drop the price to $250. Then after that we are on SSR and completely crush all fucking volume, we slide thru the weekend, and Monday we do it again. Improving our short position emencely. Would you look at that, it worked again. I basically have the sword to cut the strings anytime I want.. Holy shit $200 to $50?!?! HUGE gains on the way down. Easy $$$.

I know us apes are dumb AF, so if you don't understand by now, we might really need to rethink this whole situation. LORD AND BABY JESUS, I HOPE I AM SO WRONG THAT I LOOK LIKE A COMPLETE FOOL IN THE END. More than I have ever been in my lifeüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè

FOR THE REST OF US. My guess is there will be some nice hype build ups and crashes, but the only way we truly go to the moon is via Reverse split or Shares get recalled. Neither of these will ever happen in my opinion. Here's why. They have no rules and they run everything. They can do all of the shady shit they want, and never get more than a fine or a slap on their stupid fucking cock jerking wrist.

As much as I FUCKING hate to say it, that's how I feel. Please prove me wrong, that would make me so fucking happy I just might jack off all over the fucking ceiling.

Now feel free to kick me in the dick. let me here a better explanation other than ‚ÄúTHEY HAVE TO COVER‚Äù No they don‚Äôt.. they have no rules. Fucking sad but true.

This is not investment advice, I'm just a dumb schmuck that still likes the stock. Just my humble opinion. Please do your own DD, and not just follow what others say. We all have a brain in there somewhere, some of us obviously way more smooth as others. 

PLEASE LET ME BE WRONG LORD, PRETTY PLEASE.....","My extremely unprofessional take on what's going on here. First off I would like to say that I want GME to take us all to the fucking Moon JUST AS MUCH as anyone else. So before you all crucify me, hear me out.
