**April 8th Court Date Broken Down!**

To all MAXD Shareholders and those that want to be:

\*\*FACT:\*\*In 2011, when Google‚Äôs annual sales were reported at $39.7 Billion dollars, Larry Page and Sergy Brin it‚Äôs founders approved an Executive Summary that stated that Mr. Attia‚Äôs technology was worth $120 Billion dollars annually to Google. (Google is making lots of money on the IP)

\*\*FACT:\*\*On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia‚Äôs intellectual property rights. (VALID STILL)

\*\*FACT:\*\*On March 1, 2017, at Google's request, Max Sound Management met with Google Representatives to mediate the Attia matter. At the end of the day, no settlement agreement was reached, and Max Sound agreed to leave the mediation negotiations open while the case continued. (WHY AS FOR NEGOTIAONS IF YOUR NOT GUILTY?)

All of the postponing and legal positioning was at Google's behest to try and discredit MAXD and have them removed from representing the case. Why? Because it would be easier to make it all disappear if MAXD was not involved. Google's legal options are exhausted, they have basically admitted guilt and their damage control is not working. If you do not believe it then I guess time will tell.

**MAXD HD AUDIO LISTEN TO THE DIFFERENCE===========**

It absolutely makes a difference. The sound quality is amazing.

===================================MAXD ====Voice Biometrics=====

""Traditional user authentication includes the customer answering a comprehensive list of questions to help the call center verify the identity. This leads to prolonged call handling time and immense customer dissatisfaction. Voice biometrics can automate the authentication process by eliminating the time required by a live agent to authenticate calls by enabling customers to verify themselves using their voice as a password for resolving their queries or issues.""

""The global voice biometrics market size is expected to grow from USD 0.98 billion in 2019 to USD 2.84 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 23.7% during the forecast period.""

""The voice biometrics solutions are used across various application areas, including access control and authentication, fraud detection and prevention, forensic voice analysis and criminal investigation, and others. The access control and authentication segment are expected to hold the largest market size during the forecast period. An increasing need for customer identity authentication across call centers is expected to spur the demand for voice biometrics solutions across the world.""

MAXD is in the perfect position to get their share of this growing market!

**Brand New Agreement MORE COMMING VERY SOON**

On March 4, 2021, Max Sound Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) entered into a license agreement with Tip Solutions Inc. (‚ÄúTIP‚Äù) for ten years that includes an initial licensing fee paid to the Company of $100,000 with at least an additional $100,000 annually for ten years going forward to maintain license exclusivity creating an aggregate value to the Company of at least $1,100,000 for said license. The Company expects significant additional opportunity and projectible income to be qualified in the future as a benefit due to the potential for Revenue Sharing under Table D of the agreement.",MAXD,1.0,1615820420,Dzas1632

I want to bring attention to what I believe is a massive P&amp;S being performed by Jim Cramer and mainstream media on Boeing stock, ticker symbol BA.  First, I need to disclose that yes, I actually was previously a licensed and registered Financial Advisor. This means I was paid by an investment firm to give financial recommendations to wealthy clients. I chose to leave that position years ago. Therefore, you should not take anything I say as financial advice.

On Friday, March 12th, the headlines went crazy saying Boeing gets a brand new order from 777 Partners, revealed the order, unveils the order, secures an order, and so on... But what if this actually wasn't NEW news... Well it's not. This was the only article I could find that points out ""while the deal was officially announced Friday, Canada's budget carrier Flair Airlines first reported the agreement back in January when it announced a deal to lease 13 Boeing 737 Max jets from the investment firm.""

""Flair will lease the initial 13 aircraft from one of its significant financers, 777 Partners, who recently entered into an agreement with Boeing for 24 new Boeing 737-8 aircraft"" the January 27 statement read.""

Oh and fun fact, 777 Partners owns a stake in Flair. What are the odds then, that 777 Partners owns Boeing stock? Well, I tried tracking this down but 777 partners has tons of subsidiaries, and tracking of those smaller funds is near impossible. Basically, they covered their tracks really, really good....

Here's another one off article, the ONLY ONE on the entire internet reporting this! Southwest Exec can't hide texts in Boeing Max RICO suit. I spent the last 2 days digging for anything to validate this information.... and I finally got it! I was able to locate a site that had the most recent court documents uploaded and sure enough, it's 100% true.

\*\*Southwest will need to provide all text communications regarding Boeing spanning back to 2011!\*\*

Now of course Southwest objects to this, citing various reasons like the confidentiality of trade secrets, the difficulty in reproducing such materials, Southwest's opinion that these aren't relevant.  Well too bad, the judge doesn't care and he is demanding them, and due quickly! In fact, most of the deadlines show as March 18th. A day before March monthly options expire, how convenient..

In reading through the case I found some pretty damning stuff, but I'm trying to keep this video under 20 minutes, so let me know in the comments if you want me to really get detailed on this....

Now lets check out insider activity... Maybe it's just me, but everything seems like a huge game of deception. Directly from [Nasdaq.com](https://Nasdaq.com) you would hope this is accurate, right?  Ok, let's go through the last 3 months and sees if 126,161 shares were really purchased by insiders...and note, only 54,158 shares sold, according to this overview.

Here is the last month of activity. Notice how nearly all the transactions are dispositions? Well, when you dispose of something, does that mean you are acquiring it or getting rid of it? Right... So, these are all shares sold and look at the prices, between $215.98 and $223? If Boeing was really worth more than $250 don't you think insiders would have held out for a better price?

Also please note how all the acquisitions show as $0.00 as the price. These could be stock options or direct shares awarded to the insiders, basically free shares that they converted then sold, or disposed of which they acquired at no cost and sold at the open market price... Lets go farther back, which takes us back a full year actually. More $0.00 acquisitions, more selling....

AND FINALLY, HERE WE GO, an options exercise someone actually paid for, but at $71.44 per share! Must be nice to obtain shares at that price when the share price was actually over $200 per share.

So the last legitimate purchase of shares by an insider was by Steven Mollenkopf back on August 5th, 2020. He bought 1,152 shares at $173.36 a share...and then a bunch of more dispositions back in March 2020, you know when the coronavirus pandemic was starting to grow rapidly!

Am I the only one who finds that interesting? As the pandemic was starting, huge insider selling... They wait a year, and now start unloading shares again. If you go even farther back, the previous mass sale was just after the 2nd Boeing MAX went down, but before Boeing accepted any responsibility.

Jim Cramer from CNBC has been pimping out Boeing stock like he's a paid shill. When someone called him out on his obsession with Boeing, saying the company is absolute garbage. They are criminals at this point.""

Cramer responds ""It's no obsession, it is based on being the ultimate re-opening play because almost every airline will need more planes. Chill says that you should rethink your bias""

So regardless of the morals and ethics of Boeing leadership, regardless of the loss of life caused by the intentional misguidance and deception Boeing has admitted to doing to the FAA... Jim Cramer is only in it for the money....and even that, his logic is flawed. Airline traffic is not higher than pre-pandemic times, planes are sitting around everywhere still. But why would he care about the truth, he job is to pump the stocks his boss tells him to.

I like to invest in companies that make products I want to support. Boeing has lost all of my respect and trust. Boeing was charged with 737 Max Fraud Conspiracy. This is directly from the website of the department of justice. Boeing was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.

U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox stated ""the misleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA impeded the governments ability to ensure the safety of the flying public. This case sends a clear message. The Department of Justice will hold manufacturers like Boeing accountable for defrauding regulators - especially in industries where the stakes are this high""

As Boeing admitted in court documents, Boing deceived the FAA about an important aircraft part. A huge issue at Boeing is the company culture. Their culture of concealment and having employees mock the FAA, with documented proof of one employee commenting ""this airplane is designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys"".

Just last week was the 2 year anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, last Wednesday to be exact, and the victims families met with Pete Buttigeg for nearly an hour, pleading for Pete to reinstate the ban on the 737 MAX. Mayor Pete is the Transportation Secretary now, so that is quite an open ear to speak with.

My condolences to the relatives and friends of the passengers, who aren't satisfied with the 2.5 billion dollar settlement Boeing made to avoid criminal prosecution for fraud. I don't blame them... That's horrible....and the drama is far from over. Boeing has worked hard to keep the reports to US regulators that helped keep the 737 in the air between the two disasters sealed...but now, the National Transportation Safety Board told Boeing in a letter on Monday that it should turn over nearly 2,000 documents to lawyers representing the families. This news article says they might even receive these documents as quickly as Thursday, again March 18th...

As another sign of just how shady Boeing is, they said they plan to provide the information to plaintiffs since the 2nd anniversary passed and the restrictions would be lifted. Because after all, the 737 MAX was allowed to fly via Southwest Airlines on Thursday, the day after the families met with Pete... So yes, if you are flying soon, you may want to double check the type of aircraft you will be flying on.

I noticed the annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 20th. Take note of this please... The compensation of directors starts on page 27....and compensation continues on every page up until page 60! Seriously.... what are the concerns and priorities of the Boeing management team? Clearly, it's getting paid, in ways I'm not sure I've ever seen to be honest.

The goal of a corporation is to maximize shareholder value, at least it's supposed to be, so let's look at the shareholder proposals!  It's no secret that Boeing pays boatloads of money lobbying politicians each year. Is it really unreasonable for shareholders to want some transparency then? After all, they are the shareholders, shouldn't they have a right to know where the funds are being spent?

Well the board of directions is against the shareholder proposal! Quite frankly, they say the disclosures they do are good enough and our leadership team is so trustworthy you don't need to worry about us doing anything questionable.....RIGHT...

and the 2nd shareholder proposal... Written Consent. Now this exact proposed topic won 95% support at Dover Corporation and 88% support at AT&amp;T. This would give shareholders the ability to take action by written consent to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle, like the election of a new director. Basically, shareholders want to be entitled to some sort of power. Because they are overpowered at the annual meetings by the larger shareholders. Of course the board of directors is against this proposal! They don't want shareholders to have any power, they want to dictate all decisions and go as far to say ""our by-laws permit holders of 25% or more of Boeing's shares to call a special shareholder meeting"".

That's exactly the problem! Nobody is ever going to be able to call a special meeting with that type of requirement, you would need to own a quarter of all of Boeing! This proves the board of directors doesn't care about the shareholders, so why trust them with anything?

So going back to Jim Cramer.. What is his motivation for pumping Boeing? He's a TV personality paid to pump stocks. Here's another good one, tons of headlines spoke of how TSA scanned more travelers on Friday in over a year! Technically, this is true, but take a closer look with me. On March 12th, the TSA official number was 1,357,111. But on January 3rd, the total was 1,327,289... My point? the media is trying to portray this massive turnaround in air travel, when really Friday's travel was only 20,000 more than on January 3rd. But the headlines wouldn't be nearly as sexy if they said it that way, now would it?

Finally, to those who still think Boeing is the ultimate comeback play, and you are discrediting the pandemic that is rising again in many European countries, then at least be aware that Boeing is being outsold by Airbus...and Airbus is being much more realistic about coronavirus, stating ""the crisis is not over. It is likely to continue to be our reality throughout the year. Airlines will continue to suffer and to burn cash...""

And I haven't even gotten started on the insanely horrible Price to Earnings ratio, their massive short and long term debt in addition to the other 140 current lawsuits against Boeing... Why the heck would anyone want to support such an evil company? They place profits over safety, lied to the FAA, and coordinated with Southwest airlines to conceal fundamental issues, causing two separate planes to go down and over 350 deaths. In my personal opinion, there is nothing positive about Boeing stock.
