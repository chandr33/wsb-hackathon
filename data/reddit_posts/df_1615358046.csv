For the last couple of days the number of shares available for short (from what I've seen) has been around 500k, and a lot of negative price action has coincided with about 100k reduction in this total. For the coming day this availability looks to be doubled, and the cost to short is almost unchanged.

First off, 12 at 63 and still hodling 💎👐🏻. No matter when I sell (whatever that is), I’m coming out of this with a lot more money than I had before. Last year, my fiancée got diagnosed with a rare eye disorder called COATS disease. In short, her eye vessels never finished developing (she was pre mature), and now it’s starting to affect her vision. It’s a very rare disorder (I believe only 200,000 people in the states have it). She gets a mix of eye injections and laser surgery every other month, and the payment has been brutal. She just turned 26, so no more parent’s insurance. She only is able to work part time while she finishes her masters program, and then will finally have the time to get a full time job (and insurance). She’s been having to finesse any cash she can to make ends meet and keep her vision steady.

But because of you apes, I now have the funds to be able to pay for her next laser treatment in full. I seriously cannot thank you all enough, and I’m sure she would too. Let’s go further and further to the moon, save my fiancée’s vision, pay off our loans, and pick up our fellow apes at 300!

Let's suppose you got yourself some GME. Wouldn't it be nice to insure it? If you place a call option basically on the shares you have, betting that they will go down you will pay a premium for the call. Now, if it does go down which you hope against, but bet for, you can sell at the strike price you deem, minimizing losses. But, if the stock price goes up, you can sell your option whilst keeping your shares (sorta). Either way you made some money! Remember, there are three factors to a successful option. If your just guessing, well that's a 33% chance of success. If you calculate the variables for the moment, you might be better off.
