I have no position in Gamestop, either long or short.  I'm just watching it all with fascination.  I used to work at Activision Blizzard, where their big game is Call of Duty.  You know how much money Gamestop makes on a digital download of COD?  Zero.  Not even 1 penny.  Activision has to pay Sony a 30% platform fee, for the privilege of selling Call of Duty on the Playstation store.  Because Sony made the hardware, and got all the customers to buy the hardware, video game publishers have to pay a platform fee in order to publish their video game onto their digital store, ie, the Playstation store on the PS4 or PS5.  Same with Microsoft.  Activision, and other video game publishers, have to also pay a 30% platform fee to MSFT for users to digitally download their game.  Gamestop gets zero from that digital download, either with Sony or MSFT.  So, if Ryan Cohen is able to digitally transform GME into a digital powerhouse, and let's say all video games go digital, GME will make nothing from digitally downloaded games.  Gamestop makes money from selling physical games, hardware consoles, game controllers, accessories, maybe some funko pops, buying and selling used physical games.  But on a digital download...they don't make any money from that.  Back at the end of 2019, GME management pitched Activision, and they wanted a slice of our digital download revenues.  They explained it as, ""Look, we have millions of customers, we have their data, we know their address and emails...we can leverage that to help Activision make more money.  So...we want a slice of your digital download business.""  When my team heard about this, (we were in a conference room, waiting for a meeting to start), first, we all started laughing.  After about 5 minutes of laughing and making jokes, we got serious.  Why would we give any our of revenues to GME?  We don't need to do that.  They weren't clear on how they could leverage the customer data to our benefit.  Someone made a good point: would GME give us a slice of their used physical game business?  Because that is huge margins for GME.  They buy your used physical game for like $5 or $10, and put it on the shelf as a used game for like $20 or $25.  Great margins!  Would they give us a piece of their used game business?  No way.  They don't need Activision to do their used game business, why should they give us any of that revenue?  Same for digital.  We don't need GME to sell digitally, and, we already pay a 30% platform fee to Sony and MSFT, why would we give GME a piece of the digital rev?  So, I don't understand how Cohen will transform GME.  If you agree that physical games are going away, and digital and streaming is the future...then GME is a dinosaur.  I don't see it succeeding, but I could be wrong.  Think of this.  GME just posted their 9th straight declining quarter of revenues.  In a COVID year where people are home, you have their undivided attention, AND new hardware launch of PS5 and new XBOX, they still posted declining rev.  When new consoles come out, once every 8 years or so, you should be posting huge revenue increases, not decreases.  They still went down in rev.

I'm the one that originally posted BB DD back in November a week prior to aws announcement, in that thread, I predicted a eoy pt of 12-18, I still stand by that. 


215m rev, expected 245.


BB's downfall has always been lack of revenue growth, and the reaction matched the results.

**However let's dig a bit deeper.**

They said that they're currently in the process of selling a large portfolio of **messaging** and communication patent profile, to a **north american** buyer

And hence under that stipulation, they stated that they were unable to generate revenue using those parents. That explains why they missed.


2. I did not expect a settlement from Facebook, however I do think this buyer could be Facebook, it would make sense if you look at the lawsuits that occurred between Facebook and BB, one of them was the ability to switch from having games inlay in a messenger ( FB messenger) which BB won. 


3. Expecting 9-15% GAAP growth in cyber sec, yes this isn't as much growth as CRWD but BB is worth 4-5b vs 40b for crwd.


They mentioned USPS, looking forward to more details about that. 


Notes:
I think even the fact they mentioned the patent sale on ER would indicate that they're in very advanced talks, or they would lose their negotiating power. 


Ivy partnerships will be announced later this year and be in cars by 2022, I already predicted this but a confirmation is nice.


Overall this quarter also saw one less competitor in McAfee

They're also putting more of an initiative in marketing and brand awareness. 


They have 800m in cash, 800-900m in revenue, valued at 4-6b. With potential for explosion via IVY and more cyber sec growth in the coming years.



I think there will be more negativity to come, especially from analysts that will want to flaunt their previous price targets, they will double down on that. 

I think this will present a nice buying opportunities for anyone that wants in the coming days.

67,mgumhs,"Hi guys. 
Below I will place all the potential cannabis catalysts and why I think TLRY is poised for a run this upcoming month. 

Catalysts: 
• New York recreational cannabis legalization (4/1/2021)
• NM Mexico recreational cannabis legalization (this week) 
• SAFE Act - banking act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 
• CLAIMS Act - insurance act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 
• APHA earnings call (4/13/2021)
• APHA/ TLRY merger vote meeting (4/14/2021)
• Proposed merger date (4/20/2021) 
• Mexico recreational cannabis legalization deadline (4/30/2021) 

Current shares outstanding: 171M 
Current share float: 144M 
Current short float: 20% 
Institutional ownership: 14% 

Currently sitting at 22.04, right at trend line support. As everything in the Nasdaq, the sell off in share price has been due to the Nasdaq sell off. 

Now that we are entering a new month, we may see tech recover, and especially the marijuana sector, which has a lot of news coming. April, historically, is a good month for the stock market. 

I am mainly focused on TLRY though due to that merger with APHA that will make it the largest cannabis company in the world. 

Aphria owns Sweetwater Brewery while Tilray owns Maritoba Harvest (hemp). 
Once merged, the two companies will trade as Tilray and will headquarter in the US. 
They will no doubt use their massive cash position to acquire US cannabis companies. 
Aphria dominates not only the Canadian market but also the German one. 
Tilray currently has the Spain market as well as New Zealand and UK. 
Not only is this a US cannabis play but also a Europe cannabis play - the two most profitable cannabis markets in the world. 

Let’s send TLRY to the fucking moon!

CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) is specific, efficient and versatile gene-editing technology we can harness to modify, delete or correct precise regions of our DNA. . This technology can be used to eradicate species, make designer babies, reverse extinction, cure diseases, the list goes on and on. The CRISPR mechanism moves much faster then regulators can control which allows rapid advancement within the technology. Unlike other medical advances, CRISPR RNA is relatively cheap ( hundreds of dollars ) which allows for widespread study and HUGE demand for the product. The price of CRISPR has decreased 99% and research can be done in weeks as opposed to years. CRISPR was originally discovered in the 80s but did not gain traction until the early 2000's. The reason I bring this point up is because good ideas cant be used because of the tools they have at the time. For CRISPR the time is now. Since I am not a scientist or a biotech engineer I am going to keep this DD short and allow you to research on your own. If your really retarded and skip these big words to scroll through GME memes, take away this; In 2020, CRISPR-Cas9 won the Nobel Prize, the fucking Nobel Prize. They are solving HIV, cancer, HUMAN AGING, with this ""simple"" tool. CRISPR IPO'd at $14 and climbed over $220 in January. Since January CRISPR has gotten almost halved and is now trading around $110. This isn't just another stock to make some gainz on, this is *Already* changing the world around us, they have already created human genetically edited babies.
