4,m1pm7j,"Hey guys, I don’t usually open up to people and most certainly not a group full of 9million users but in all honestly, I’m running out of options and time. I joined the gme rally back about a month ago when it was at $300 a share and I invested everything I had (6k.) (yes, I know it wasn’t smart) I held for as long as I could and In the process lost my gf, my car and my room that I rent. I was laid off at the beginning of this COVID stuff and have still been unable to secure work. Especially now not having a car to drive it makes it that much more difficult. Anyways I held onto those shares until I had to sell the car and move out out of my home but it came to the point where I needed that money to find another place to stay and pay rent so I sold at a 60% loss. Few days before it started rising lol. I’ve still yet to secure work and I only have one gme share at 300 left. i want to sell it but I feel like it’s my only way out of this mess once it goes up. but same time I have no choice and rents coming up again. Anyways I guess what I’m saying is, If they’res anyone out there, I hope your listening, it would genuinely mean the world to me if someone could help. anything helps but my goal is 2000 and that would be plenty to get me by.

Disclaimer: Also buying 3k worth of shares of GME because obviously I like Stock

So basically, with GME running its course of Round 2ing to the moon. I am buying some share 3k worth of shares tomorrow, but that is not what this is about. This is about where I shall be in 5 years.

Yes I am autistic, but I shall be one that is successful, being inspired by GME, I shall also transition from a lazy sitting on my ass kind of ape to one that is a titan of the Financial world. My goal in all of this, is to one day be invited on to Jim Loser's show, and on live television call out his shit.

That's right apes, I shall be rich asf and still be an autistic ape. I shall reach the level of rich, that I can call the robbing the hood CEO's little boys with chump change and clown them on a regular basis.

TLDR: I have been inspired by GME to become rich asf, and call out JIM LOSer on his show. GME and my fortune to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",GME to the MOon ALonG with my fortune,1.0,1615352266,thegamingmt

69,m1pyec,"I was surprised by yesterday's Tesla increase so I analyzed the stock's historical data. 20% increase has never happened in TSLA stock since March of last year.

The highest previous increases were 18% and 14% and those were in March of last year. That's understandable because in the same month the pandemic started and the stock dropped 35%, so it was recovering.

But aside from that narrow period of volatility the stock maximum increase or drop hovered around 10%. Yesterday was double that, which begs the question, why?

The previous increase(s) coincided with micro positive trends such as increased sales, addition to S&amp;P 500, stock split, new factories and macro trends such as pandemic decreasing, new vaccine, improved economy, jobs report etc.  

What gives for yesterday's change? Is a drop in treasury yield enough to cause this, even though the company is grappling with increased competition and a drop in production due to semiconductor shortage and mind you it was already over valued.

But, truthfully, life have no meaning. I don't know what I want to do in the future. Nor will I probably want to do anything in the future. 

There are so many possible choices. But all of them require pain and endurance. Not many people have that kind of tolerance. Not many people even have time to choose a path. 

Then GME came up. At first I thought it was an overhyped stock. Whats the point in buying a ""dying brick and morter company"". Before I realized it, it reached to $154. I was shocked. That's when I decided to buy. I didn't have much. In fact I only bought 1 share.

However, when it reached $220, I decided to do all in. I didn't know what was going on. I was an idiot. I decided to read up on it.

 After a couple of hours I realized how huge this is. This is life saving money. I could go on with life without hating myself. I could donate my time helping others. I could help children at hospitals.

My life glimmers with hope. I know there will be dips. And I know the price might hit rock bottom sometime. But, I know it's worth so much more. The idea that you should leave emotions out of stocks is a true. But, being heartless to numbers is not a good option either.

I'm going to hold for dear life. I know it will reach $10k. I know it will reach $100k. And I know it will be rough getting to $500k. But selling now, is the end for a lot of people.

Before we go further, I just wanted you to know I am not a financial and/or investment advisor. It's your money, your decision. 

If you want to know who GoodRx is and what they do, you know you can get all the information you need from your best friend Google. Why do I think this company deserves your consideration? 

* What they do and offer are quite unique. There's not much direct and strong competition in what GoodRx does.
* The stock got crashed back in Nov because of a news that Amazon will be rolling out Amazon Pharmacy. The stock got dumped basically because of a news. No one even knows whether Amazon will eventually do it or do it successfully. 
* According to GoodRx CEO Doug Hirsch, GoodRx is a marketplace. Amazon is just a dispenser if in fact they decide to get into pharmacy. These are two different business models.
* The membership fees GoodRx charges are dirt cheap compare to the savings you get with their app. Try it, you will be amazed. 
* The stock also got oversold recently because it's traded on the Nasdaq.
* The short interest was quite high. Some already got covered recently but the current short interest (as of 2/15/2021) is still at 23.91%. % held by institutions is 89.13%. 
* The company reported positive earning last quarter and it was well within the estimate. They are set to report Q4 result on Thu Mar 11. If they post a surprise ER, the stock could easily go up 10% to 20% the next day.

From the chart, you can clearly see the stock is recovering from the recent market sell-off. If they post a surprise earning beat on Thu (I strongly believe they will), the potential upside is huge.",GoodRx | GDRX,1.0,1615353279,jligalaxy
