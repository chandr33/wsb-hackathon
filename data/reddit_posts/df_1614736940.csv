[GME 15m Chart at close 2021-03-02](https://preview.redd.it/7urunolaypk61.png?width=1535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85e0be9c945f9725ff4a34d48658f03dc59cf137)

As it was brought to our attention in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lweje6/keep_your_eyes_on_the_volume_behind_the_movement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (fantastic analysis) the price drop near the end of trading today is not reflective of the volume. So by using the VWMA (Yellow - Volume weighted moving avg) and VWAP (Blue - Volume weighed avg price - this is intraday) we can see where the volume expects the price to be. Essentially, these indicators can identify a sort of ""true"" price for the stock, where the market wills it to be. Since these follow an avg. they are not reactive to volatility in the same way the active trade price is. In other words, **price at close today was artificial** to some extent, a result of wild volatility or whatever else. Particularly important is price below VWMA since this covers 20 periods rather than VWAP which is strictly session (intraday). Price below both is still a good sign.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR This is a bullish signal. Price &lt; VWMA &amp; VWAP = Correction towards those indicators.

**Meaning if we closed today where volume expected the price to be, and where it will likely correct to - $124 . A $4 and 3.32% gain on the day at close**

Not financial advice, just having fun

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: since it seems relevant, I don't mean artificial in a literal sense. All I'm trying to show is that these indicators are bullish because typically price corrects back to those lines.",GME - INDICATORS SHOWING ARTIFICIAL PRICE DROP BEFORE CLOSE,0.94,1614737624,yodisc
