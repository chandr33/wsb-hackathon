39,m240ec,"This is a good stock. It has a low cost and easy entry the price atm is right at $8. It has a very low market cap at something like 25milion shares. It also has been heavily shorted despite most analysts saying it was a good buy (let's mess up these firms). Then they just revealed that they are entering a partnership with Western Union which will give be a HUGE boost for them. This gives them a more viable business strategy then something like GME (sorry but, it's true). Then someone just stepped in this morning and bought like 5% of the companies value.  So, someone else knows it is going up. I am going to keep this quick and focus on the bullets listed above. I think it's clear $TRIT is a gold mine.
