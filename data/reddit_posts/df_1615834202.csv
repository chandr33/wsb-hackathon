Inseego announces sale of Ctrack operations in South Africa.  From the above article on Feb 24th, here's CEO Dan Mondor's quote: “The sale of our South African Ctrack operations is part of Inseego’s strategy to focus solely on target markets that are closely aligned with the growth of our 5G business.  The proceeds further strengthen our balance sheet and increases liquidity to address our growing 5G pipeline.

Earnings call.  I'm not going to list all the things they have done in the last year (they did A LOT), you can read the article yourself. Here are the company highlights from the previous year:

* 2020 full year net revenue of $313.8 million, up 43.0% year-over-year, and Q4 2020 net revenue of $86.1 million, up 64.5% year-over-year
* Year-end cash balance of $40.0 million in the quarter with zero bank debt

This caught my eye because after the earnings call on March 1st, it dropped a lot on seemingly no bad news - the highlights were amazing.  What I found interesting is that the consensus was that investors were spooked because the company execs said that they expect 4G demand to be down in 2021.  To me, that makes perfect sense because if you are focusing on 5G, why would you promote lesser technology?

Highlighted Statistics:

Market cap of 1.152B.  Also, INSG has a float of only 77M.  It is also a heavily shorted stock, with 20.04M shares shorted, a short ratio of 6.91, and a 31.69% short percentage of float as of Feb 26.  The options are very cheap as well right now.

Conclusion:  

Again, I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice.  Do your own research.  Could this be another candidate for a short squeeze?  Seems like it easily could be with a low float and ridiculously high short percentage.  Especially for a company with a very good business model (5G) that is currently trading in the 11 dollar range.  But even if it doesn't get squeezed, they are focusing towards 5G with the earnings call on 3/1 and the selling of their Ctrack in south africa.  Factor in the general population moves towards working from home, teaching remotely, and remote healthcare because of the pandemic and 5G is going to be the industry standard sooner than later.

95,m5sa6h,"I’m new to the options game. Upon further research on investment strategies I came across the terms “Iron Eagle” and “ Iron Condor” 
Why are more people not using this to combat losses? And minimize risk exposures?

The iron condor is an option trading strategy utilizing two vertical spreads – a put spread and a call spread with the same expiration and four different strikes. A long iron condor is essentially selling both sides of the underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of calls and puts, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money call(s) and put(s) respectively. The converse produces a short iron condor.

The position is so named because of the shape of the profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the ""body"" and the outer options as the ""wings"". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this position is constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, despite the fact that it is ""long."" This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call spread with a bear call spread or a bull put spread with a bear put spread. Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).[1]

One of the practical advantages of an iron condor over a single vertical spread (a put spread or call spread), is that the initial and maintenance margin requirements[2] for the iron condor are often the same as the margin requirements for a single vertical spread, yet the iron condor offers the profit potential of two net credit premiums instead of only one. This can significantly improve the potential rate of return on capital risked when the trader doesn't expect the underlying instrument's spot price to change significantly.

Another practical advantage of the iron condor is that if the spot price of the underlying is between the inner strikes towards the end of the option contract, the trader can avoid additional transaction charges by simply letting some or all of the options contracts expire. If the trader is uncomfortable, however, with the proximity of the underlying's spot price to one of the inner strikes and/or is concerned about pin risk, then the trader can close one or both sides of the position by first re-purchasing the written options and then selling the purchased options.
