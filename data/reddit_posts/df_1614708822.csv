1,lw8mij,"Ok, posting here to see what you all think of this idea  


 **MIK**   
Float: 100M       


News: - March 1 - ""Michaels, bolstered by the pandemic craft boom, is attracting buyout interest from private equity."" 

Catalyst:   
\- March 4 - Q4 Earnings Report (possible more info on buyout)    


Thesis:   
\- Retail/Momo play   
\- Buying the rumor to sell the news.    
\- Short Float +15%   
\- Looking for a run up into Thursday morning's ER on the buyout rumor.    
\- Buyout rumor with no figures will allow speculation to run wild.    
\- Don't get greedy with this one and holding through ER is possible high risk.   
\- Of course watching how market looks and will add or cut position if we think market is turning against us.   


Basically we have a high level of short float combined with rumor news of a private buyout. With a clear catalyst being the Q4 ER on March 4. We can push the shorts out making them cover driving price up. There is no Buyout price. Speculation can easily drive this stock higher.   


let me know what you all think.

I recently decided to go back to monkey. So there is still a lot of thing i don't understand (not a native english speaker + new to stock market). I started to check IBorrowDesk last week, when I understood what it stands for. But I'm wondering about something : why are there only 55,000 shares to borrow atm (market closed yesterday with 450,000) ?

Are the HFs syphoning every single share they can borrow to maintain the price at the current state ? Does it mean, the price will soon increase (when the amount of available shares will be 0) ?

I plan to dump RH and am looking for a good desktop application that I can begin trading with the WSB community on.  So the questions below are about what are people using:

1. What Applications do you recommend?  
\- While I am new to it, I don't plan to get a managed account or do crazy things yet, I don't understand options, or any of the new features.  Just want to watch and trade stock with my fellow apes.
2. What is appropriate fees?  With RH there isn't a ""Fee"" you just loose part of your soul and chances to do something great...  So for standard stock trading and for room to grow a portfolio what should we be paying?
3. Can it set up alerts?  Like most people I have a main job, so I can't always be attentive to catch the dips and tendies.   So hoping we can have an App that allows you to have some smart decision monitoring or even allow limit sell/buy

I know these seem like basic questions, but great to re-open this thread as we get more and more members who want to excel with the group.  We are all after major trendies, we are all after changing our lives for the better.  Once GME saga completes, and the Hedgies are toppled, we have to grow and adapt as the market will figure out more ways to keep out new hands from winning.

If it isnt obvious enough that theyre artificially stunting the prices, i dont know what is. Moreso AMC now, than EVER before. there are BILLIONS of dollars on the line here, and they will do whatever it takes. Their strategy this time is to attempt to “wait you out”   and hope you sell. 

As cliche as this sounds, literally, just hang tight, dont sell, and do not let any posters, the media, news articles, or ANYTHING sway you from that. AMC moves in tandem with GMC these last weeks. look at the gallery pic below .. this is no coincidence my friends. Keeping amc down is their biggest priority, maybe of their life. or they can kiss themselves and their funds goodbye. There is a LOT at stake here. 

Im not stating this is going to 2x, 5X, or even 10x. no one knows yet. this is more than just the money. Think about how many times you sold a stock because it was dumping only for it to come back up later ?

This is a case to squueze short with buy and hold because the company has upcoming FDA dates and most importantly increasing revenue. You are on the lowest point of entry right now, ever. Buy and wait for more decisions and for 2020 approvals to start generating more profit.

 CLVS has a pipeline of cancer drugs dealing with solid tumors.

Rucaparib

[Rucaparib](https://clovisoncology.com/pipeline/rucaparib/), an oral, small molecule inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1, 2 and 3 is being developed in multiple tumor types, including ovarian and prostate cancers, as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents.  Exploratory studies in other tumor types are also underway. Clovis holds global rights for rucaparib.

Lucitanib

[Lucitanib](https://clovisoncology.com/pipeline/lucitanib/), an investigational angiogenesis inhibitor, which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (VEGFR1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDFGRα/β) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (FGFR1-3). Emerging clinical data support the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy to increase effectiveness in multiple cancer indications. Angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are frequently up-regulated in tumors and create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Use of antiangiogenic drugs may reverse this immunosuppression and augment response to immunotherapy. Lucitanib clinical development is focused on combinations with checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of solid tumors. Clovis holds global rights for lucitanib excluding China.

FAP-2286 and Peptide-Targeted Radionuclide Development Program

The Company’s peptide-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy development program includes lead compound [FAP-2286](https://clovisoncology.com/pipeline/fap-2286/) and three additional unnamed preclinical targets discovered by 3B Pharmaceuticals. The initial focus is on developing FAP-2286, a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (PTRT) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP). FAP consists of two parts: a peptide that binds to FAP and a linker and site that can be used to attach radiation for imaging and therapeutic use. FAP is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, including more than 90 percent of breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas.1 Clovis plans to initiate a broad clinical development program for FAP-2286 as a FAP-targeted therapeutic agent in the first half of 2021. Clovis holds global rights for the discovery program and for FAP-2286 holds U.S. and global rights, excluding Europe.",Reload. CLVS. Clovis Oncology,1.0,1614709311,SnooObjections5334

Maybe they are playing the long game and realize that their growth as a company is dependent on BC price action. If they let BC go too parabolic, it reduces the amount of BC they can mine at that price as well as  effects overall balance sheet stability and performance.

If they could put a leash on growth and make this bull run last way longer than previous cycles, it would tremendously increase their CAGR over a multi year period and stabilize their revenue growth.

I still think BC going parabolic is inevitable at the end of cycle but part of me thinks they want to draw it out as long as possible which honestly may be the best for BC value.

Short term futures are practically dirt cheep most of the time and with the ability to shoot up 400 - 1000% during a market crash, I don’t see why anyone wouldn’t just dump their money into this guaranteed short squeeze.

96,lw8ybb,"Hello WallStreetBets,

Software developer here. Just wondering if anyone knows of any affordable APIs for pulling financial data? Years ago, before I got into programming, I used to look up financial information using EDGAR, but that is pretty tedious and slow. Does anyone know of any affordable APIs where I can access similar financial information programmatically via an API at an affordable price?
