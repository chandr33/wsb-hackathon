11,m0qwl7,"Hello Smooth Brain Apes. My GF and I have been following the GME saga for awhile now, even bought in and got out like the paper handed bitches we are (Sweetheart, you're not a bitch, I'm just trying to speak their language). She wanted to offer some alternative DD for yall. Enjoy. 

[Should I hold, sell, or buy more?](https://preview.redd.it/u06jcyd3ivl61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c6dcf6a8a92f1a037457034b904b3d40596b4d)

6 of Cups

""if I hold,"" is basically saying that you are holding onto a childhood innocence. Your decision is based in a childlike fun rather than logic, facts, or reason. You're probably returning to a mindset of escape from actual responsibilities and holding the shares in hopes that they pan out and bring you the freedom you had in your youth.

King of Wands

""if I sell,"" you won't regret your decision. Even though you will make the decisive and actionable choice of selling your shares, you'll still enjoy the thrill you received from playing the game, so to speak. You won't necessarily be deciding to opt out in the future, but it feels like the right choice of a leader at this time. Keep watching and consider buying back in if the mood strikes. But use caution, because you might just be giving into feelings of the high of gambling.

The Emperor

For ""if I buy more shares,"" you need to think looooooong and hard about this decision. You are being called for more stability in your life, not added uncertainty. Other people may be watching your decisions here and it would be irresponsible to lead them falsely into poor choices. It's time to set aside fun and games and consider the facts before you.

Seven of Cups (clarifier aka card on the deck)

It's saying that you have so many options before you and, because you can see all the options all at once, you are going to struggle to make the right choice. It's good to consider all paths, but be cautious about living in fantasy. There is a right choice here, and you need to think through everything with your feet on the ground or you'll be strayed by your thoughts of whimsy.

[Where will the stock be in 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months?](https://preview.redd.it/bpdu5ryeivl61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa1ab15f724996acaf371eadaa7b375eff5796b4)

5 of Pentacles

One week, it's going to plummet lower than it has yet.

7 of Cups

One month, anyone's guess. There's too many factors to predict.

Judgement

Six months, it's going to be over. People will lose interest. It's now time to look at what you gained and lost, in terms of your personal growth more than finances. Odds are, you learned a harsh lesson.  


In conclusion: Both of these readings say you'll probably not be much further ahead than where you started, but you'll learn a lot and enjoy the ride.

**Short Interest (SI)** image included indicates that shorts covering has helped but they are still at a low level meaning historically this is relatively the lowest amount of shares shorted this year.  There is still enough shorts to help the price action upward and also enough to give stability to this big increases if they call it quits.

**Implied Volatility (IV)** is up but the contract premiums during the first squeeze were significantly higher.  For example, on 1/29 the stock was around $325 and the contract costs were:

At The Money (ATM) strike $325 1 wk option cost about $125

Today....ATM strike $195 1 wk option cost about $30.

Two things, 1) there is much less IV b/c this was a much slower and methodical rise albeit still over a short time period.  2) Since options premiums are still relatively cheap around $30 ATM I think (correct if wrong) they are still affordable enough to continue pressuring a gamma squeeze.

Implied 1 wk move is 15% ($30/$200) +/-  based on the contract prices.  This is much better than the plus or minus 38% ($125/$325) +/- 1 wk move last time. 

**Technicals.**  I don't look at technicals but I'm thinking this is one view you can add to your technical view about where there is support and what the options market is pricing in.

I'm kinda new to this options trading thing and need some not financial advice on gaining some sweet tendies. Background: 23 - in college (limited capital) - and severely retarded. 

In order for my calls to maintain profitability, GME would have needed to hit 300 tomorrow. So I sold my call premiums at $190 hoping GME would hit support levels around 170 so I could use the proceeds to purchase a more reassuring and potentially profitable 3/19 call. Then GME FUCKING DID ITS THING and refused to go below 200 by market close. I only have about 2.5k available to invest as my main account is on hold from transferring. Hypothetically, if you were in the same position what calls (or better to buy shares?) would you be eyeing at market open.

**TLDR; Volume, MACD, and Short Availability are all extremely bullish for GME. HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀.**

Hang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.

**Case 1 : VOLUME**

Look at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

Secondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)

 

**Case 2 : MACD**

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.

&amp;#x200B;

[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**

From last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Final Thoughts**

There are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or ""In The Money"". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.

This also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.

The technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL. Don't be scared with dips as long as the trend is your friend. **🚀🚀🚀🚀**","Technicals Show GME is Going Much Higher. Analysis on Volume, MACD, and Short Availability. 🚀🚀🚀",1.0,1615240257,Mitchy45
