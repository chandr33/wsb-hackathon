73,m1zo2w,"Unpopular opinion incoming.

I'm not sure what to do with this sub anymore. Since the user account went parabolic, the overall quality of the posts (and even more the comments) seems abysmal.

I've lurked on WSB for a looking time at this point, didn't feel the need to share my positions (read : losses), but enjoyed reading it several times throughout the day.

Now, it's 90% of GME noise. And the comments section looks like a sandbox for actual retards who can only say 'apes', 'crayons', 'to the moon'. The DDs are mostly Cpt. Obvious levels, or just morons trying to look for confirmation on their GME purchase @ 350. Looks more like people are trying to advertise and get traction for their positions from posting than being entertaining and/or informative.

Heck, I checked the rules for posting before actually posting this, it seems that every single post lately goes against most of those rules. Not even starting the debate about the political statement bullshit that we read in every second comment about 'we gonna fuck Wall St.'

For the others who used to fuck my wife before we were swarmed by the brainless masses (who don't fuck anything besides their student loans and mortgage repayments), how do you browse this mess to filter out the noise? Is there any subreddit about stocks that's hasn't been contaminated by this degenerative condition that emerged in January?
