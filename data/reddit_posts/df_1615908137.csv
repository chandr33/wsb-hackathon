Not a financial advise...
 Buy the fucking dip and dont make the same mistake that i did when i didnt buy the $48 per share GME cuz i got afraid that i would lose more. WSB is not a place for people who gets scared when the board turns RED.
All of us who stayed here and Hodl for the last 3 months can say that this kind of scare tactic doesn't faze us anymore cuz we don't  give a flying fuck we simply thank for the sale and buy more.

 To the hedgies and their cronies reading this...SUCK MY DIAMOND GOLD GILDED DICK!! im not fucking selling. Do your worst and i wont care for i would be just busy watching Gordon Ramsey in Hell's Kitchen.

To the Apes..
 THIS IS WAR you fucking sons of bitches casualties are fucking expected and loses will be everywhere because this is a life and death situation the hedgies wont simply just roll over and give up. This aint disneyland where is all sunshine and rainbows, people enjoying and laughter in the background. Welcome to fucking hell where reds are green, green are green, and Mondays are the new Fridays. If you fucking cunts cant handle pressure you dont deserve to be here in WSB.

To the True Diamond Hand Comrades...
Its just simply a typical day in a typical week here in WSB lets grab a drink and food and play games on our consoles and let the paper hands panic and shills demoralize the paper hands. We know that they know that we know that they are really fucked and desperate for the MOASS is about to come. Lets just chill, sit back, and relax. We thank the hedgies for giving us a big sale on GME cant wiat for the next paycheck.","Diamond Hand Veteran here. I Held GME from January and never sold, this kind of crap reminded me of the plunge of GME from $200 to $100 per share during february down to $50 - $48 per share then rocketing to $100 - $150 per share at the end of february.",1.0,1615908511,JumpyContribution799
