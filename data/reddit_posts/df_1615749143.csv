I have been around for a while and seen how thoughtful and close this community is. Teaching and helping newcommers, supporting each other mentally, psychologically and even financialy is truly wholesome. Don't get me wrong, donating your own money and adopting animals is generous and thoughtful and is of course your own choice. 

But for the love of god, FOCUS! You can donate 10 times more money after the squeeze if you feel like it, i will too! Just keep your eyes on the main goal and remain focused! 

One of the biggest weeks might be comming up regarding GME catalysts, including stimmy money hitting the stock market and all of a sudden everyone  decides to give their money away? The timing is suspicious and you can draw the conclusions for yourselves.

**AMC OUTSTANDING SHARES (Class A) as of March 11, 2021:** 

450,156,186 Shares

Source (SEC Filing): [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/ef37ab99-d475-4102-aab7-88e64e53a3b9.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/ef37ab99-d475-4102-aab7-88e64e53a3b9.pdf)

Scroll to bottom of the first page. This can‚Äôt be manipulated.

**RECOUNT NON SENSE:** 

AMC published (on March 5, 2021) a Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholder to be held on May 4 2021

This meeting is held to approve the increase the total number of shares of Class A common stock by 500,000,000 to a total of 1,024,173,073 - among other things.

They set the date of March 11, 2021 as the ‚Äòregister by date‚Äô to be allowed to vote in that meeting: ‚ÄúOur Board has fixed the close of business on March 11, 2021 as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting‚Äù

**Source (SEC Filing):** [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/cfb297c4-ea33-4d48-9135-78d2b9f640cb.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/cfb297c4-ea33-4d48-9135-78d2b9f640cb.pdf)

There is no recount. They know exactly how many shares are outstanding. They are not trying to count shares. They are just doing the routine call to register for the right to vote. As not every shareholder wants to vote, they asked to created proxys/quorums to vote en masse. Standard procedure.

Last year, AMC published the same notice, asking for the same registration, as is absolutely normal and standard: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e2e535fa-d203-4b99-b206-05f2009217c9.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e2e535fa-d203-4b99-b206-05f2009217c9.pdf)  


  
Now, I am bullish on AMC not because of crazy conspiracy theories. but based on facts.

Fact 1: People won't want to stream new movies, they will want to go to the movies, make an event out of it, hang out with friends. Streaming, we've done enough of it in 2020. I think Box office will go way up from 2019 levels, once 70%+ of the US population has been vaccinated (Fall 2021). But even for Memorial Day Weekend and July 4th Weekend - we should see some super high attendance numbers.  


Movie going is a cheap, easy, everyone can go type activity - when compared to other things people have been missing - like travel.. going to the movies, is doable by almost everyone  


Fact 2: AMC renegotiated movie ticket fees they pay to the studios. In the earnings call, AMC CEO said that if you're seeing Warner bros movies in their theaters, it's because they came to an agreement.. Rumors on the street is that they used to pay 55% in fees back to the studio, now they could be at 38%. Numbers aren't published, so they are not fact. But they did lower their cost.  


So if attendance goes up from 2019 levels, and AMC gets to keep more per ticket sold, that means they would bring in more NET revenue than in 2019 - not even talking 2020.  


Fact 3: Add the stimulus, markets going green, covid going down, vaccines going up.. it's looking good for AMC in the mid-term.

24,m51y2d,"Dear Member,¬†  
Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on March 19th?¬†

First things first, I'm going to keep using the sorta-kinda-gold-but-on-a-computer and banned tickers as recommendations because they make money. If you don't like it, find a different newsletter and I'll keep napping on my piles of virtual cash sitting in my¬†SPAC¬†bed. This is my return from ban by WSB for it and most of those degenerates are better at making memes than they are at investing so I guess I kind of had it coming. Sooooo here we go again!¬†

We're going to pick up right where we left off with some serious consideration of the wants/needs of people who are leaving the pandemic lockdown with hopes and aspirations of having a good time again. We got Carnival Cruise lines for a smash hit a few weeks back and we're going to find more (full disclosure: I'm definitely going to play them again). Our other acknowledgement is that virtual cash is tearing right now. That isn't going to stop. Grab a ticket for the tendie train and ride it until the wheels fall off. If you're not in already, just get what you can. Imagine you're buying and holding a super special magic version of SPY shares.¬†  
CRWD - 3/19 $220c  
My weekly pick is going to be CRWD. They've had a terrible week/month and are sitting $53 under their 52-week high. They've been wildly successful at beating earnings and continuing to improve their per/share outcomes. Here is the deal, everybody loves a good ramp up to earnings report, but the earning report itself could screw everything up. My take is this: the stimmy is getting delivered and they're going to beat earnings while trading at \~80% of ATH. Will it return to ATH? Doubtful. It will more than likely take a serious upturn and hopefully push for $220. I'm going to grab the $220c for 3/19 and hopefully dump within a day. Maybe before the earnings even deliver...¬†  
CCL - 7/16 $40c  
I have to do it. The goal is open season for ALL adults in the US by May 1st. Give that 4 weeks and we're looking summer travel dead in the eyes. We all know your redneck cousins in Nebraska are excited to get back on a boat for fake vacations to the carribean. They've got Facebook posts to catch up on. I'm looking at the July 16th $40c for movement back to $10 under their pre-pandemic numbers ($30 under ATH). As always, do NOT hold these when you hit your profit goal %. Dump that¬†  
NVDA - 5/21 $610c  
Here is the wild card for you. Nvidia is trading at $100 under ATH and their progress as a companies shows absolutely no signs of slowing down at all. Given the landscape, they've had a terrible month, but the company is not only solid, but they're increasing demand with the need for GPUs related to mining. The 5/21 date is paired along with the earnings report that will happen then. We all know they're going to produce an insane amount of profit and when that hits, we're going to cash in big time.¬†  
SNDL - 3/19 $1.5p  
If you're a real degenerate gambler looking to get yourself high blood pressure, play this one with me. Sundial Growers delivers earnings after close on Wednesday. We all know the future legalization of marijuana is going to make them a huge company, but right now they're trash and we all know it. They're the penny stock of weed companies. They've had a GREAT week leading up to earnings. I'm going to wait until the end of the day Tuesday or Wednesday to watch it go up more. When it hits $1.50+, I'm going to grab some puts. Here is the delicate part: it doesn't move much at all in comparison to those option prices. So what we're going to do is grab $1.50 puts for 3/19 that are already almost ITM. Then hold those babies when they flop on earnings. Full disclosure: this is an absolutely STUPID play, but it's going to be hilarious if it works.¬†  
Good luck this week! May the power of J-Pow be with you in Tendie Land.¬†

      * ""**for this report, only those enrolled in Vanguard Personal Advisor Services¬Æ (PAS) are known to be advised**"" - I assume this is why they have 30m users, but only 5.1m in this report. Not everyone uses PAS, that's for getting access to advisors (and paying a fee).

97.9m\~ users WITHOUT including Robinhood. Just shy of $18 TRILLION rough numbers. Then remember, *there's international markets*. [This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. ""China‚Äôs approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth‚Äî81 percent said they trade at least once a month"" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)

*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:

A graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)

The above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.

&amp;#x200B;

GME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. &amp; if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.

&amp;#x200B;

|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|730k shares|
|1|10|1.46m shares|
|5|5|3.65m shares|
|5|10|7.3m shares|
|10|5|7.3m shares|
|10|10|14.6m shares|

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.

""The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)""

It appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*

So why does retail ""not control the market"" ?

Personally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.

1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.
2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for ""power"" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.

Workmate tells me about the stock, we both invest 95% in MSCI World and boring stuff.  
I tell him that this stock is stupid. I buy the stock for the lols.

What is the companie about?

Making Magnesium our of rubble. They got a large amount of rubble for free and will **soon** make Magnesium out of it and sell it with very high margin due to superior extraction methods. Of course they never made because they still build small experimental factories.

They rename the comany.  Consolidate 20 stocks to 1. Stonk drops from low to low. They turn of their homepage. I hold because I dont really care. But now the Stonk explodet. Maybe they wanted to push everone out because they really made it?!

42,m520w4,The short interest is at 20%. I‚Äôve seen people saying the stock is gonna hit 1k. That was the goal when the short was 169%. I would say at this point you guys are literally pumping all your money in one stock and taking each others money. I don‚Äôt see the potential in this going to the moon anymore. Even if that 20% was covered at one time (which would never happen) the stock might hit $400 for a slight moment.,Someone explain to me how you guys think this stocks going to the moon,1.0,1615749794,Trenbolone8

50,m5231x,"I do not know how to post, I am not a fully functional human bean. My brain is smoother than listerine.  


I haven't gotten my stimmy deposited yet, but after I pay off my speeding ticket and get tags for my car i finna adopt an ape too. People saying this is a FUD campaign for HF need to chill, its like getting a credit card knowing someone else is gonna pay it off later, how much can u spend? however much u want and are willing to wait. It kind of like reverse shorting, but all you have to do is hold the underlying security and spend the premiums until you sell the underlying for more than the premiums you spent.   


So my smooth air o dynamic bren is convinced that GME moon which means for every share I own, I will be paid out 1k-100k some time later down the line, which means I can spend unrealized profits now instead of averaging up and be paid back for whatever I spend when I cash out later. Its basically free money. If i spend 50$ on an ape, and GME goes to 350, ill have effectively spent less than 1 day worth of gme gains for PR that could cause it to shoot to 500. This is why its always important to spend the money before you have it because if GME falls to 150, you probably might kick urself for not being able to buy back .3 of  a share to avg down like 2$ but i mean...risk vs reward or am i just too stupid to see this.   


I wanna buy an ape because everyone else is buying apes, buying apes will get me nothing except a feeling of cumra dairy. Since markets are closed I have no idea how people are selling GME shares to buy apes. I mean, they can't right? unless its daylight savings time...which wont really matter, markets open an hour earlier tomorrow.   


We already have a bullish sentiment, and the sub was being filled with partial DD and FUD or Echo Chamberization the best way to keep up the sentiment is not  to post more price target DD's or SI reports or compare it to amazon or tesla in 2004. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN so now we make memes and do funny things. Since giving money to people is shady af since everyone lies (SEE: HUGH LAURIE &gt; GREGORY HOUSE) and we wont be sure where the $$ will be going towards so we buy products and memes (TENDIES, APES, CONSOLES). Remember during the first rip people were donating switches, buying billboards, airplanes messages, and tendies to people. Funniest most touching shit ive seen in a long time.   


The other day i scrolled through and saw someone donated an ape, i thought it was hilarious, then i saw another one and another one. I did some research and lookied into banana futures, since im retarded i couldn't read the graphs or recognize the numbers. My conclusion is  that donating to save apes is both funny, nice, and tugs at my hart. ESPECIALLY JIM CRAMERS TEARS, my fav ape.   


THE BIG SHORT: i just saw this banks were caught selling literal shit to people, and someone caught on and said hey isn't that a little too risky lets make some fucking money.   


THE BIG SHORT SQUEEZE: THIS IS LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE, banks are telling me that the gold bar i hold is shit, but someone caught on and said isn't that a little risky? its fucking shiny lets make some fucking money.   


In the first movie I have no idea what credit default swaps are and im pretty sure all 9.4m of us would have been unable to cash in on that because what the fuck? Where as the 2nd movie shows that banks learned a lot in 2008 and have been shorting everything to shit so they can keep determining what ""VALUE"" is. How long in the housing bubble until they got fucked? about 7 years. How long can they fuck without cumming? 7 years. But at the end of the 7th year someone said, hey my asshole is worth more than 5$ fuck you u can't cum inside. THEN banks said u dont know what ur asshole is worth, its worth NOTHING, no one will wanna fuck u ever again. The banks then decided to play with each others assholes for a bit. While fingering each others butthole BANK LOOK TO YOU, look its about to shit look it crowning, and we say thats not shit, thats the gold bar you ate last year is gonna come out and we get ready to catch it, and they suck the poop back in like what r u talking about i dont even poop. IF IT POOPS MOST LIKEY SHIT C OMES OUT FUD starts coming, and we like...but we saw the gold before u sucked it in....how long can u hold it in...its not healthy bro just let it rip. But they keep swallowing gold bars and holding in the poop hoping that they can take a shit in their private bathroom before having their intern clean the shit and remarket it.   


TL;DR BuY Tendies Before, Apes NOW, MOONS and STARS LATER. Send NANAS to MOON, SPACE ZOO PLANET OF THE APES THEME PARK serves only bananas and tendies drinks are Jim Cramer Tears Crazy  Sippy Straws.

77,m52aga,"My market shorts. 3/15

As of Monday morning, March 15th, also known as the ""Ides of March"" I am starting to liquidate my positions and look for the best form of derivative to work my way into my short position.

I am entering a net short position against all major indices and bond markets (short dated and long dated.) 

From my research, I have found that the biggest payout would be awarded from:
$SQQQ
Jan 20, 2023
$40 Calls

Through theta decay, delta, other greeks and implied volatility, a mere 700% increase in $SQQQ, would yield 2200%+ returns with these calls (on the date of expiration)

The reason behind choosing these calls:
- I wanted at least 6 quarters of decay and runout on my calls.
- I had figured that the technology sector would be the hardest to fall in the events of a market collapse.

Can anyone find any derivatives with the same requirements, that would yield a bigger return?
