Orphazyme had its annual report today.   
I suggest you listen to their webcast.

Cytrx licensed the molecule Arimoclomol to Orphazyme.

Arimoclomol should be approved for Niemann Pick Type C (NPC) by June 17, 2021.

Still in H1 2021 two pivotal final studies using Arimoclomol will be presented:

One study in ALS and one study in sIBM

The patient pool for ALS and sIBM combined are around 100k with 5k per year diagnosed and 5k dying.  


Treatment costs per patient per year is above $150k to $200k.

For each 10k patient, Orphazyme will sell probably around $1.5 to $2.0 billion per year.

Orphazyme will have to pay royalties to Cytrx (ticker Cytr) around 7.5% (ALS 10+% / non ALS +/- 5%)  


Cytrx will get between $112 million to $150 million income per year for 10k patients and the patient pool is 100k large.  


Cytrx has up to 40 million outstanding shares, this meant the income is approx. $3 to $4 per share.  


Apply a very conservative market cap. factor of 6 and you get between $18 to $24 pps for 10k patients.  


30k patients should be easy to reach, bringing the pps of Cytrx to $75+.

Currently Cytrx is at approx. $3.2 pps and OTCQB:  
[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CYTR](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CYTR)  


The Orphazyme presentation indicates, they want to charge Arimoclomol between $300k to $600k per patient and year.  
I used for the above calculation already a lower cost number, assuming the price might be lower for ALS/sIBM treatment due to the larger pool of patients.  


The pool of patients is also in the Orphazyme presentation.

  
The royalties estimation are described here from the Orphazyme prospectus 2020 (page 92 printed / page 98 in document)  
[https://orphazyme.gcs-web.com/static-files/47229b42-7f73-467e-a714-b8722b620134](https://orphazyme.gcs-web.com/static-files/47229b42-7f73-467e-a714-b8722b620134)  


Cytrx has also a licensing agreement for the oncology drug Aldoxorubicin with ImmunityBio (owner is Patrick Soon Shiong, which owns LA Time and LA Laker and who invented Abraxane).

Aldoxorubicin might represent another $25 pps for Cytrx share in the near future.

Cytrx has also developed a next generation of Aldoxorubicin like drugs - 4 LADR-drugs using the same platform and using then same mechanism of action compared to Aldoxorubicin but with ultra potent drug payloads, like auristatin-E.  
Check out www.centurionbiopharma and it presentation, which is full owned by Cytrx and which advances the LADR platform. The LADR platform represents probably another $100 - $150 pps for Cytrx, but is 7+ years away.  


Cytrx seems to be a good long term investment with those 3 assets: Arimoclomol, Aldoxorubicin and LADR-drugs.

***DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.*** Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. 

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. ***All trading strategies are used at your own risk.***

***DISCLAIMER#2:*** The risk associated with any position you take is inversely proportionate to your bank roll. The act of selling naked calls or shorting stock carries with it an infinite amount of risk.

43,lwdnai,"First off, I don't want to distract anybody from GME. It's been a great cause and you retards taught us how to fight and be strong. Let your efforts continue and let your tendies come.

I wanted to share some details of what's been going on with RKT and where it's potentially headed and what to expect. The current price (\~$40) is around, or a little bit below, the fair market price. The price action since the IPO was highly suspect and there were some good DD before pointing to possible price manipulation - if you're interested you'll be able to find. 

The short interest stood at 39.73% as of Feb 12 ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/RKT/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/RKT/short-interest/)), which continued to increase and was reported to be at 45.8% by S3. Currently, there were reports of the borrowing rate in the range of 80-90%, and Fintel reported the number of shares available to borrow as 0 ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)). I checked with Schwab and Fidelity - no way to borrow.

Now, Rock Holdings Inc. (controlled directly by the founder Dan Gilbert) owns 1867M shares of RKT while the number of shares outstanding is 115M, so despite the $82B market cap of RKT, the actual total value of shares on the market is $4.7B. This is important because while there is no way for a short squeeze with an $80B cap, the number of shares outstanding makes the story a little different. 

Gilbert is one of the smartest guys out there. A few weeks ago, he explicitly said on the TV - ""This is not a stock you wanna be shorting"". Since he owns 95% of RKT, the high short interest is definitely not what he wants to see. Also, there is little chance that owning 95% and having only 5% in the float is his end game. He is not an idiot. This is just my opinion, but it seems that he came up with a perfect plan to fuck up short - announced a special dividend and threatened with a stock repurchase. He is probably waiting for the shorts to leave, and he might want to start unloading some of his stake later on when the price isn't artificially suppressed. Brilliant.

Institutions like the stock. They were buying it like crazy - check the filings here [https://fintel.io/so/us/rkt](https://fintel.io/so/us/rkt). What's more, the institutional ownership is reported to be 105.24% on Fintel. If this is true, shorts are fucked. But how could this happen? Well, when institutions bought shares and lent them to shorts, they then simply could have bought them back when shorts were selling borrowed shares. This high institutional ownership makes it quite similar to the case of Volkswagen, where, despite a smaller SI, there were very few shares on the open market. Remember, institutions are here often for a long haul.

Lastly, the potential for an extra gamma squeeze - looking at the options chain ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/option-chain)), there are 44M shares that need to be delivered if the price stays above $40. Combined with crazy institutional ownership, a low number of sellers, this is just fucking perfect.

&amp;nbsp;


**BACKGROUND**
&amp;nbsp;

The company I'm looking at today is B Riley Financial (Nasdaq:$RILY).  The company is a broad financial services provider which started as an investment bank and currently includes segments in capital markets, auction and liquidation, valuation and appraisal, and principal investments. 

&amp;nbsp;

The capital markets segment provides an array of investment banking, corporate finance, research, wealth management, sales and trading services to corporate, institutional and high net worth clients. 

&amp;nbsp;

The auction and liquidation segment utilizes a network of independent contractors and industry-specific advisors to tailor its services to the needs of a multitude of clients, logistical challenges and distressed circumstances. 


&amp;nbsp;

The valuation and appraisal segment provides valuation and appraisal services to financial institutions, lenders, private equity firms and other providers of capital. 


&amp;nbsp;

The principal investments consists of businesses which have been acquired primarily for attractive investment return characteristics.

&amp;nbsp;

**FINANCIALS**
&amp;nbsp;

[RILY recenly released their Q4 2020 and FY2020 results](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2021-02-25-B-Riley-Financial-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results-Declares-3-50-Dividend) last week of which the following are highlghts:

&amp;nbsp;

**Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights**

* Record quarterly total revenues of $410.2 million vs. $165.2 million for Q4 2019
* Record investment banking results driven by increased activity and larger transactions
* Net income of $170.1 million vs. $16.9 million, EPS of $6.55 vs. $0.59 per diluted share
* Operating revenues of $270.0 million vs. $130.5 million, Operating EBITDA of $126.8 million vs. $16.4 million
* Q4 total adjusted EBITDA of $260.5 million vs. $50.3 million

&amp;nbsp;

**Full Year 2020 Financial Highlights**

* Record annual total revenues of $902.7 million vs. $652.1 million for FY 2019
* Net income of $200.4 million vs. $81.3 million, EPS of $7.56 vs. $2.95 per diluted share
* Operating revenues of $798.7 million vs. $545.6 million, Operating EBITDA of $311.7 million vs. $113.6 million
* Annual investment gains of approximately $104 million
* Annual total adjusted EBITDA of $406.8 million vs. $207.9 million

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, with the earnings release, they announced an increase to their quarterly dividen from $0.35 per share to $0.50 per share as well as **a special dividend of $3.00 per share for a total dividend to stockholders of record on or around March 24th of $3.50 per share.**   This would bring the dividend to about a roughly 5.4% rate which is a very strong return (looking at you $RKT folks)

&amp;nbsp;


**OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND HISTORY**
&amp;nbsp;

So how has the company done over time you ask?  Since 2016 revenue has grown from $190 million in to an estimated $798 million in 2020, a ~42% CAGR. EBITDA has grown from $48.9 million to approximately $406 million or a ~65% CAGR, and the regular dividend has grown from $0.32 to $1.50.  Additionally, [they recently completed the acquisition of National Holdings Corporation](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2021-02-25-B-Riley-Financial-Completes-Acquisition-of-National-Holdings-Corporation-Creates-Meaningfully-Enhanced-Wealth-Management-Platform), another wealth management firm, with asset management of approximately $20 billion to add to the already existing $12 billion management portfolio. Since this is a recent acquisition income and revenue from this acquisition won't hit the financials until the Q1 earnings are released at the earliest.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, just yesterday they [announced the full redemption of 7.5% Senior Notes due in 2027](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2021-03-01-B-Riley-Financial-Announces-Full-Redemption-of-7-50-Senior-Notes-due-2027) showing another strong financial indicator.
Also, the largeest shareholder in the company, CEO Bryant Riley, has continued to be bullish in his own comapny with continued stock buy backs through out the last few years, with the most recent being [a $4.6 MM purchase in January at $46 a share](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-rily/b-riley-financial/news/chairman-co-ceo-bryant-riley-just-bought-20-more-shares-in-b). A lot of conviction in the long term growth in the company from the C-Suite folks.

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, I'll leave this bit of research from hype machine Seeking Alpha, which notes that RILY is trading at a deep discount in relation to it's peers is the financial sector.  It currently trades roughly around 3x to 4x EBITDA, while other firms in the sector are trading around 14x.  Now, this isn't to say that RILY will be at that 14x rate, but it does lend some credence to where it could go.  Seeking Alpha goes on to note that even at a 40% discount from it's 14x EBITDA would put the price per share around $111, which would represent a 71% increase in value from the current stock price.

&amp;nbsp;


**CONCLUSION**
&amp;nbsp;

I feel as those this might be a hidden gem in the financial sector as it has a very diversified set of offerings that can benefit from both up and down markets.  Additionally, leadership has show strong conviction in the company and analyst feel as those the long term gains are there. I don't know if $111 or $150 a share is on the horizon, but I'll be very interested to find out and see where this one goes.",The Case for $RILY: A Financial Sector Sleeper DD,1.0,1614722343,guyatwork37

64,lwdp9a,"First off, I don't want to distract anybody from the stock we all love. It's been a great cause and you retards taught us how to fight and be strong. Let your efforts continue and let your tendies come.

I wanted to share some details of what's been going on with RKT and where it's potentially headed and what to expect. The current price (\~$40) is around, or a little bit below, the fair market price. The price action since the IPO was highly suspect and there were some good DD before pointing to possible price manipulation - if you're interested you'll be able to find. 

The short interest stood at 39.73% as of Feb 12 ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/RKT/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/RKT/short-interest/)), which continued to increase and was reported to be at 45.8% by S3. Currently, there were reports of the borrowing rate in the range of 80-90%, and Fintel reported the number of shares available to borrow as 0 ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)). I checked with Schwab and Fidelity - no way to borrow.

Now, Rock Holdings Inc. (controlled directly by the founder Dan Gilbert) owns 1867M shares of RKT while the number of shares outstanding is 115M, so despite the $82B market cap of RKT, the actual total value of shares on the market is $4.7B. This is important because while there is no way for a short squeeze with an $80B cap, the number of shares outstanding makes the story a little different. 

Gilbert is one of the smartest guys out there. A few weeks ago, he explicitly said on the TV - ""This is not a stock you wanna be shorting"". Since he owns 95% of RKT, the high short interest is definitely not what he wants to see. Also, there is little chance that owning 95% and having only 5% in the float is his end game. He is not an idiot. This is just my opinion, but it seems that he came up with a perfect plan to fuck up short - announced a special dividend and threatened with a stock repurchase. He is probably waiting for the shorts to leave, and he might want to start unloading some of his stake later on when the price isn't artificially suppressed. Brilliant.

Institutions like the stock. They were buying it like crazy - check the filings here [https://fintel.io/so/us/rkt](https://fintel.io/so/us/rkt). What's more, the institutional ownership is reported to be 105.24% on Fintel. If this is true, shorts are fucked. But how could this happen? Well, when institutions bought shares and lent them to shorts, they then simply could have bought them back when shorts were selling borrowed shares. This high institutional ownership makes it quite similar to the case of Volkswagen, where, despite a smaller SI, there were very few shares on the open market. Remember, institutions are here often for a long haul.

Lastly, the potential for an extra gamma squeeze - looking at the options chain ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/option-chain)), there are 44M shares that need to be delivered if the price stays above $40. Combined with crazy institutional ownership, a low number of sellers, this is just fucking perfect.

So ironically for once in my life, I decided to do the sensible thing and try to decrease my exposure to my tech stocks. I thought to myself, hey lets get some QQQ leap puts to hedge against sky high valuations and rising interest rates. Good idea I said to myself as I started looking at ATM put options that expire what I thought was May 5. 

But, being the dyslexic idiot that I am, I accidentally bought put options that expired MARCH 5 because apparently, I need a Tl;Dr for something as short as reading the name of the fucking month. 

So here I am, $10,500 in put options that will probably expire worthless in a couple of days, praying to god that Nasdaq opens blood-red tomorrow morning.

My theory is these new accounts, whether they be interns or shills/bots or what have you, are either working to farm karma so they come across as more credible when the actual shit starts going down again. Or, are trying to use a lot of terms like “what are WE doing?” “I thought WE were all focusing on GME?” In order to create evidence of market manipulation on a large scale on WSB.
