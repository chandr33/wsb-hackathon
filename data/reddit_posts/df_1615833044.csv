11,m5rfyg,"If your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than $150,000, the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 11, 2021, excludes from income up to $10,200 of unemployment compensation paid in 2020, which means you don’t have to pay tax on unemployment compensation of up to $10,200. If you are married, each spouse receiving unemployment compensation doesn’t have to pay tax on unemployment compensation of up to $10,200. Amounts over $10,200 for each individual are still taxable. If your modified AGI is $150,000 or more, you can’t exclude any unemployment compensation.

[IRS issues New Guidelines for Exclusion of up to $10,200 of Unemployment Compensation](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/irs-procedures/forms-publications/new-exclusion-of-up-to-10200-of-unemployment-compensation)


The exclusion should be reported separately from your unemployment compensation. See the updated instructions and the Unemployment Compensation Exclusion Worksheet to figure your exclusion and the amount to enter on Schedule 1, lines 7 and 8. 

The instructions for Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 7, Unemployment Compensation, are updated to read as follows.

Line 7
Unemployment Compensation
You should receive a Form 1099-G showing in box 1 the total unemployment compensation paid to you in 2020. Report this amount on line 7.

Caution. If the amount reported in box 1 of your Form(s) 1099-G is incorrect, report on line 7 only the actual amount of unemployment compensation paid to you in 2020.

Note. If your modified adjusted income (AGI) is less than $150,000, the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 11, 2021 excludes from income up to $10,200 of unemployment compensation paid to you in 2020. For married taxpayers, you and your spouse can each exclude up to $10,200 of unemployment compensation. For example, if you were paid $20,000 of unemployment compensation and your spouse was paid $5,000, report $25,000 on line 7 and report $15,200 on line 8 as a negative amount (in parentheses).  The $15,200 excluded from income is $10,200 for you and all of the $5,000 paid to your spouse. If your modified AGI is $150,000 or more, you can’t exclude any unemployment compensation. Use the Unemployment Compensation Exclusion Worksheet to figure your modified AGI and the amount you can exclude.

If you made contributions to a governmental unemployment compensation program or to a governmental paid family leave program and you aren't itemizing deductions, reduce the amount you report on line 7 by those contributions. If you are itemizing deductions, see the instructions on Form 1099-G.

Caution. Your state may issue separate Forms 1099-G for unemployment compensation received from the state and the additional $600 a week federal unemployment compensation related to coronavirus relief. Include all unemployment compensation received on line 7.

If you received an overpayment of unemployment compensation in 2020 and you repaid any of it in 2020, subtract the amount you repaid from the total amount you received. Enter the result on line 7. Also enter “Repaid” and the amount you repaid on the dotted line next to line 7. If, in 2020, you repaid more than $3,000 of unemployment compensation that you included in gross income in an earlier year, see Repayments in Pub. 525 for details on how to report the payment.

Tip. If you received unemployment compensation in 2020, your state may issue an electronic Form 1099-G instead of it being mailed to you. Check your state's unemployment compensation website for more information.

Unemployment Compensation Exclusion Worksheet – Schedule 1, Line 8

Enter the total of lines 1 through 7 of Form 1040 and Schedule 1, lines 1 through 7.

 Include the full amount of unemployment compensation you received in 2020 on Schedule 1, line 7.

Use the line 8 instructions to determine the amount to include on Schedule 1, line 8 and enter here. Do not reduce this amount by the amount of unemployment compensation you may be able to exclude.

Add lines 1 and 2.
Enter the total of line 10b of Form 1040 and Schedule 1, lines 10 through 21.

Subtract line 4 from line 3. This is your modified adjusted gross income.
Is the amount on line 5 $150,000 or more?
[ ]Yes. Stop You can’t exclude any of your employment compensation
[ ]No. Go to line 7

Enter the amount of unemployment compensation paid to you in 2020. Don’t enter more than $10,200
If married filing jointly, enter the amount of unemployment compensation paid to your spouse in 2020. Don’t enter more than $10,200

Add lines 7 and 8 and enter the amount here. This is the amount of unemployment compensation excluded from your income.
Subtract line 9 from line 2 and enter the amount on Schedule 1, line 8. If the result is less than zero, enter it in parentheses. On the dotted line next to Schedule 1, line 8, enter “UCE” and show the amount of unemployment compensation exclusion in parentheses on the dotted line. Complete the rest of Schedule 1 and Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.","IRS issues New Guidelines for Exclusion of up to $10,200 of Unemployment Compensation",1.0,1615833155,SuperBullish2021

Given that not everyone has gotten their stimmies and the time it'll take for transfers, buy orders and settlement...I think we are yet to witness the effects of the stimulus on the GME.

Corsair $CRSR makes high end PC peripherals and other pc/gaming parts. Leading publicly traded “top” gaming and pc brand. Obliterated earnings. Revenues up 70% yoy, profits up similar amount, gross margins increased by several hundred basis points, you get it.

Well tech sold off hard and Corsair fell with it. However, a ton of unprofitable tech cos were trading at 40x sales and negative profits and Corsair is currently 1.6x sales and 30x PE while growing revenues and earnings at 70% yoy. 

Had it not been for supply constraints, revenues may have been another $100M higher in Q4. 

Corsair made a number of acquisitions to diversify its product lineup moving forward. I personally think the market has been too conservative in its valuation of Corsair’s growth prospects.

Finally, every IB analyst has a price target of $37+. When I’m not a huge fan of following analyst recommendations, the AVERAGE PT is mid $40s, or 33% up from here.

Corsair hit $50 before falling to $28. However, it is now back above its 3 month support of $32 and holding steady. Volume has been next to nothing as the stock was forgotten, but if and when it returns, $45 can hit quickly.



Concerns: 1) Corsair was a pandemic play, it peaked last quarter.

I think this is false. Management recently addressed this by saying that growth wasn’t “pulled forward,” and they expect to continue growing rapidly in coming years. The secular growth of gaming and streaming only benefits Corsair moving forward, as gaming has entrenched itself as a new alternative to television.

2) lock up expiration in a week.

This was my biggest concern, but the CEO views it as a nonevent. The previous lock up expiration a month or two ago led to an 8% increase in stock price by end of day. Other recent IPOs like PLTR had no material downturn from the lock up expiring. Given how cheap the company is trading, insiders may continue holding through the expiration. IMO, a lot of buyers are waiting to buy the post lock up dip. What happens when there is no major dip? FOMO to the moon.
