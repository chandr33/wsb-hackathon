Some of us are scared after having seen the stock drop from 483 to 40 in such a short time. However, the hedgies know this and they're going to try their damn hardest to scare you people. As seen the last couple of days they have barely be doing any small attacks to the stock, they know these won't even make us flinch anymore. My thought is that during the way up to the squeeze they'll only attack us with huge drops like today. The reason for this is purely because they want to simulate that downfall from last time to the best of their abilities. They want to make you think it's going to drop to 40 again and that you're gonna lose everything before you can react... However what they don't realize is that we are utter retards. And we utter retards need to keep in mind that, as long as we HOLD and buy those flash sales they give us, we'll be flying to the moon! Keep those diamond hands strong and let's fly together!

Aight you retards. This some serious shit we gonna go through. Strap in because the so called, ""2nd squeeze"" will be big, even though it isn't the squeeze we all know will eventually happen that will fk over HFs and allow us to finally land on Mars with Elon's rocket ship. 

Alright, so looking at the chart for GME over the last 3 months, we can see there is a large spike after the initial run up, highlighted by the small white box before the large blue box. From corner to corner (closing prices for those days) is what I believe is the ""run up"" before the ""squeeze"" (just a metaphor). **This area goes from $19.95 to $43.03, or an increase of about 216% (x2.16).** 

**Now, when looking at the blue box that follows, we can see that from corner to corner we have a price** **range of $43.03 to $347.51, or an increase of 808% (x8.08).** Now, when comparing the increases on both days, we can see that the 216% ""run up"" over a period of 7 trading days led an 808% gain, or a x3.74 increase. This means that for each day that passes within the ""run up"" is an increase in the multiplying factor by 0.534, resulting in our 808% increase for the apparent ""squeeze"".

*Just to double check, with that x2.16 increase of the run up, we can apply this and multiply by 3.74 (0.534 \* 7 days). This leads to the 808% increase that we calculated above.*

So, assuming that this x0.534 factor stays true, let's apply this to the recent ""run up"" we had starting 13 trading days ago. 

Over this period of 13 trading days for the current ""run up"", **we have a range of $44.97 to $262.99, or a 585% increase (x5.85).**

Applying the ""run up"" factor of 0.534, **13 trading days \* 0.534 = 6.942 --&gt; 6.942 \* 5.85 = 40.61.**

40.61 \* the closing price of today ($262.99) = A closing price of the height of the ""2nd squeeze"" of $10,680.02, or an increase of 4061%. 

**TL;DR: We will have an increase of about 4000% during the apparent ""2nd squeeze"" to have a share price of $10,680.02. Hold the fking line.**","The 2nd ""Squeeze"" will be big - GME TA",1.0,1615418455,shakabuee23

     One month ago when news of the üöÄGameStopüöÄ rebellion spread to YouTube, as well as the lying media, I learned about this United group of pubic masterminds that were bringing the crooked hedge üí∞üí∞üí∞funds down to their knees.  
    I watched every bought and sold corporate media establishment like, The Wall Street journal, the Washington Post, Bloomberg, ABC, NBC, and every other fake news corporate media media outlet out there demonize the people of Reddit.üò†üò°ü§¨ they are trying to bring identity politics! the very same tool that used to break up Occupy Wall Street.
     The corporate shills said you were right wing extremists, and multiple other crazy character assassination allegations.

60,m2c486,"While I wait for my rocket to take off and loving my GME I‚Äôd like to direct attention to a Pharma company reporting earnings tomorrow at 4:30pm. 

KMPH, or KemPharm Inc. discovers and develops various proprietary prodrugs in the United States. Its product candidate includes KP415 and KP484 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and KP879 for the treatment of stimulant use disorder.

It got FDA approval for KP415 on the night of March 2nd. The stock then shot up 100 points in premarket trading and ended the day doubling its value overnight. Since then it‚Äôs been shorted all the way back down to it‚Äôs starting point at about 9 bucks and change.

To handle the commercialization of this drug KMPH is in kahoots with a company called Corium. They will receive a receive a royalty on sales.

If you take a look at the [screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=131&amp;f=sh_avgvol_o100,sh_instown_u50,sh_price_o2,sh_short_o15&amp;ft=4&amp;o=-shortinterestshare) you‚Äôll see that KMPH is number one in short float with 71%.

Here‚Äôs the catch. We are talking 71% short on a stock that has 4 million shares float. What‚Äôs the recipe for a squeeze? High short float ‚úÖ, low amount of float available‚úÖ, and last but not least, a catalyst.

After market close, KMPH reports earnings. This is after FDA approval. Word is out that an acquisition may be in play (I cannot confirm that part). What I can confirm is that a 46k share purchase drove the price up 30 cents at close according to lvl 2 data. 

With some volume, what could we do?

KMPH gained 14% today. A nice little gap up, and all day I watch the shorts fight to try to keep it below $10, to no avail. 6 million on volume today, a lot higher than average. [2374116 short volume today (March 10th) ](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210310.txt) - that‚Äôs half the float

A little bit of boost and this thing literally takes off.

1yr Price Target (Yahoo Finance) = $26


If anyone could contribute more facts or test the validity of what‚Äôs been said I‚Äôd appreciate it! 

I‚Äôm not a advisor, and this is not financial advice, I just like the stock.

69,m2c551,"If you think this week was sexy, get ready to break out the red panties... 

Tuesday, March 23rd, 2021 GameStop will be releasing their financial statements.

If you follow CNBC, or Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance - you‚Äôll see a little bit of chatter around GME. And ONE similarity amongst them all is that there is a negative undertone, or some sort of jab taken at GME as a company, or GME retail investors.


LET ME DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT:
Notably, I watched an interview this morning which triggered the need for this post, it was between Andy Serwer and Suze Orman (a ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô Personal Finance Expert). Well for someone who claims to be an expert, I heard some really dumb shit... I‚Äôm sorry, some really uneducated, ignorant dumb shit come out of her mouth during this interview.

This was a interview on the tongue in cheek topic of GME, which included some subtle attempts to use some Reddit lingo. Suze Orman goes on to say stuff like, ‚ÄúSome people made some money, but the majority of people entered GME at $320/ share‚Äù (well, guess where we‚Äôre at today Suze... on the cusp of $300, and with a bunch more shares that we DCA‚Äôd down... Chedda Baby! üßÄ)

She goes on to say, ‚ÄúGameStop I think is just STUPID.‚Äù ... (well ok Suze, opinions are like assholes, everyone‚Äôs got one...) üí®

‚ÄúI understand the philosophy behind it, with the short squeezes.. and everything..‚Äù (solid DD there Suze) üëèüëé

‚ÄúThat‚Äòs not investing,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt invest in something because you figured out a way to squeeze them..‚Äù (so you‚Äôre telling me that the opposite isn‚Äôt true? Hedgefunds aren‚Äôt investing when they short??) ü§®‚ùì

And here comes the best part of this verbal diarrhoea... üí©

Suze says, ‚ÄúYou invest in a company because you LIKE THEM. You Like their MANAGEMENT. You like their POTENTIAL.‚Äù (Holy shit... is this fucking Opposite Day lady?? Should I be putting my pants on backwards and whenever I say YES it means NO? Like what in the actual fuck did you think is going on at GME??) üôÉ

‚ÄúNow maybe GameStop will turn into something that‚Äôs fabulous in the long run, but that wasn‚Äôt an investment, it was a game. And that game needs to stop.‚Äù (At this point this lady has zero credibility to me and I had to counter with this post - why does BlackRock, VanGuard, StateStreet and all of these massive institutional investors have 111M shares of GME? 167% of the outstanding shares... right... because they‚Äôre not investors Suze!!??) üê≥üêã

BACK ON TRACK:
So all of this to say that on March 23rd, financial statements will be released. Announcements will be made about the evolution of the company, which we got snippets of this past week. We will see a retail giant announce a pivot towards ecommerce, lead by e-commerce guru Ryan Cohen. üêïüêàüê∞üêπüïπüí∞üí∏üíµ

So what‚Äôs going to happen on the week of March 23rd, is we are going to see all of these media outlets, that have otherwise been tongue-in-cheeking GME, slandering the Apes of Reddit and avoiding reporting the real news on GME, will have no other option but to report what GME announces... the PIVOT. üíªüéÆ‚å®Ô∏è

HOLY FORKING SHIRTBALLS
- Who would have known that GME was going to go digital??? E-commerce? Really? We thought Ryan Cohen was just buying in to a dying company, trying to declare some losses on his gains from the Chewy sale... ü§îü§£ü§£

I‚Äôm in the process of switching from a cash account to a margin account. Here‚Äôs my strategy (and I know it‚Äôs probably not a new one but given my situation I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a good idea): 

He deposits the $25,000 in my account. I buy $25,000 worth of one stock and set a stop loss order on it, so if it drops all the shares sell and I lose $10 (I‚Äôd take the loss out of my own money, not his). I‚Äôm expecting this to happen often because the stock would have to drop a very small percentage for the stop-loss order to sell my shares. But, if it goes up, I let it run to, let‚Äôs say, $500. Considering $25,000 was the initial amount, a $500 return isn‚Äôt that much. That‚Äôs the strategy. This works for me because I‚Äôm a senior in high school, I have about $1,500 to my name, so $500 on one trade would be a lot for me. The stop-loss order hedges my risks. 

No, my dad would not know I‚Äôm doing this. And yes I understand I morally shouldn‚Äôt be playing with $25,000 that isn‚Äôt mine. But again, I know how to hedge my risks.

I am not a financial advisor, and I just like the Stonk. But here‚Äôs my financial advice anyways.

We did it, we burned the hedges, but we‚Äôre not done yet. They need to burn at the stake for the things they‚Äôve done and said. People are excited because we got GME to 200+ (again). Guess what? Who the fuck even cares. It doesn‚Äôt end here, right now, many of you beautiful apes are getting a stimulus check from uncle Joe, regardless of whether you love him or love to hate him, that‚Äôs free money. Think about all the apes ü¶ç, like me and you, that are going to dump all their money into stonks. It‚Äôll be crazy. We thought $1000 was the goal. NO. We can go even higher. Because when life gives you a banana üçå you fucking eat that banana. Bananas make apes strong, when apes ü¶ç strong üí™ apes win. The real squeeze has only begun, we still got a week or two of hard fighting. Biden is set to sign the bill this Friday. Hopefully we get our bananas üçå the following week.
