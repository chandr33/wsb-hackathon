23,lx75uz,"Okay so here are my thoughts. Behind Nestle, PepsiCo is the biggest company in it's sector by revenue. It also follows Coke stock fairly closely. But what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19.

KO or Coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy. It's payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94%. Meaning they only had 6% left over after paying out their shareholders. That's not a lot of money to do much of anything with. ESPECIALLY in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of Soda.

To compare with PepsiCo, which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019.

To give you specific numbers, in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 1.79% compared to 2017. In 2019 it increased 3.87% compared to 2018, and in 2020 increased a 4.78% which might I remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic. Now why did PepsiCo do well against their main rival coke?

To answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than coke's and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from ""Toilet Paper Bandits"" or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos, lays, cheetos, and on the healthier side of things Quaker Oats and other products. Until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but I believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the Cola Wars.

Pepsi has a dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of 79.88%

Coke has a dividend yield of 3.35% and a payout ratio of 93.85%

With the payout ratios so high I am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but I would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status.

Share price:

I see PepsiCo valued at $154.36 a share
Trevis Evaluation puts then at $150.16 which I believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way.

This is an upside of 18.46% not including dividends.

And I calculated Coke to be valued at $52.72 a share.
Trevis Evaluation puts it at $55.48 which is more than I calculated.

Taking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 11.00%

There are many other reasons I believe Pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon Zebra (which I would love to try) to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare. Which the mixer market tops 858 MM$ and an industry that grew 35% just last year. Cocktail culture is coming to North America and in the United States and Canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make.

What are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general? Do you think PepsiCo is undervalued? Or do you think Coke is still a better buy? Let me know in the comments.

Okay hear me out. This is assuming you are investing in companies and not simply trading stocks for quick profits. Obviously short-term traders use price charts in all kinds of fancy ways to make their money. It seems like astrology to me, but apparently enough people are making a living off of day trading so I won't comment further on that.

Investing in companies isn't necessarily 'long-term'. It just usually ends up being long-term because companies tend to make more money over time, not less, so selling early is generally dumb.

With these boundary conditions established we can get to my point.

Whatever price an asset was in the past says nothing about what the price of it should be today. Therefore, price charts are useless for determining the true value of a stock.

Consider an ideal whore at room temperature. It costs $5 to sleep with her. Yesterday it would have cost $10 to sleep with her. The reason for this price difference is unknown to the market in general, and can only be speculated upon. Does the fact that the price is different have any bearing on your decision to sleep with her? It shouldn't. Here are some conditions you might use to make an informed choice on your financial decision:

* Do you have $5 to spend?

* Is there something more valuable to you, for whatever reason, that you can pay the same $5 for?

* Does she have any STDs?

* Does she have any semblance of a personality?

* Etc.

Now, you might think, 'Well it used to be $10. I only have $5 now and it might go up in the future!' That type of thinking is dumb. You literally have no idea why the price difference was there. You can speculate, but it's only that: speculation. This type of thinking is inherently irrational, and by allowing it into your decision process you are adding noise to your signal, taking away mental processing on considering the types of questions such as the ones listed above.

So how does this relate back to stocks? We can value stocks the same way. Everyone has his own valuation strategy. I look at earnings, the company's capacity to grow, the market's capacity to grow, whether the company's guidance is conservative or aggressive, etc. When I do this, the price chart doesn't fucking help me at all. The reason is because this chart doesn't actually give me any useful information beyond what a historical price was. This is because price correlates with too many things, and we can't break that down to specific indicators that we can actually play upon. In essence, price charts are more noise than signal. When you decide to buy or sell a stock, you should be basing it on the current price and your valuation model. If you allow yourself to start rationalizing decisions based on price movements, you're playing yourself by allowing emotional, irrational thinking to become involved (astrology). Again, if you're day trading, that's totally different, and theoretically day traders use other tools like volume to make their decisions, not just price charts.

So what does this have to do with retards on WSB? It means stop looking at fucking price charts and selling your shit too early, or buying shit just because 'the stock is cheap right now'. Know what the fuck you're doing, or just blindly follow one of the smart retards like DFV. Either of those things are going to be better than 'taking a profit' or 'buying the dip' on stocks you know nothing about. Don't allow yourself to get into emotional voodoo by looking for signs through price charts. Instead, look at indicators that have better defined causation: earnings, dividends, debt, news, etc.

Supplemental information:

Price charting is analogous to the following, in my retarded opinion:

* Astrology

* Biblical numerology

* Divination

* Flat earth beliefs

* Young earth creationism

* Feng shui

* Crystal healing

* Myers‚ÄìBriggs Type Indicator

* Scientific racism

* Social Darwinism

* Parapsychology

* Anything from MRA movements

* General theory of relativity

* Etc.",Looking at price charts is bad and stupid,0.69,1614813912,anikom15
