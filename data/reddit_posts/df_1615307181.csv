0,m1a21y,"Hi all!

As the title states, I recently found myself with a sudden large influx of cash. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $200k+ 

I currently make a decent living, around $45k a year, but this is more money at once than I've ever seen in my lifetime and I DO NOT want to squander it. At the same time I do not know how to capitalize on this good fortune to it's fullest.

I have been wondering, is there a way to invest this money so that I am:

1.) Able to leave my day job

2.) Have the initial investment continue to pay out so that I do not have to worry about money again, provided that I live fairly conservatively and do not go wild with spending?

Any and all advice would be appreciated, thank you very much!",Recently came into a large influx of money and have no idea how to make the most of it,1.0,1615307184,JustBrowsinAtWork

\-Been chugging along since 2004 with no profit

\-Have a bunch of land in San Javier in Mexico

\-Big silver and gold region

\-Mexico produces 17% of worlds silver

\-2021 Announced a magnetic survey revealing potential deposits

\-Private placement, ie they got money from someone (they raised 3 mil)

\-Barksdale is a competitor also sniffing around that area (they raised 6 mil)

\-Commenced exploration drilling mid Feb

\-Fact that they commenced drilling then someone gave them 3 mil is a pretty good sign

(Ie they found something promising) 

\-Raise announced on the 5th is probably the reason for the share price spike

\-Personally I would wait and see what the drilling results comes back with

\-I reckon price will dip after excitement of raise abates

\-As soon as drilling report comes out, if good get in as early as possible and ride to the moooon!

Firstly, so I don't lose the apes who can't read

**TLDR:** We will launch as this is criminally undervalued and prime to 2x-5x in the next 3 years in a growing igaming &amp; gambling industry. If you like to gamble and game, buy Paysafe (BFT) 🚀🚀🚀. Short term, I see this **above $25 before end of April**.

Now if you are still reading and not eating your colorful crayons, good for you. I want to do a deeper dive into Paysafe/BFT short-term, my positions and what I think a safe floor is. An amazing DD which initially got me can be found here by non other than [dhsmatt2/](https://www.reddit.com/user/dhsmatt2/): [Original DD on $BFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)

Firstly, Paysafe/BFT is the main payment processors for igaming &amp; gambling in U.S &amp; massive in Europe. If we think short-term next few weeks, we have three events I love. 1) Roblox IPO 2) March Madness 3) Merger Vote

1. **Roblox IPO-** This will occur tomorrow. Now, many of you are very excited about this and following recent trends of anticipated IPO's in last 6 months (Air BNB, Dash, AI, Snowflake) all have opened 1.5-2x of original price. Roblox uses paysafe for their igaming network... so if you think igaming is going to continue to grow, paysafe/BFT is the safe bet.

📷

iGaming &amp; Social Media using Paysafe. If you like these stonks and think they will keep growing, having $BFT is a winning ticket.

📷

Middle Diagram is very very hot from a technical perspective, left and right from growth perspective.

2) **March Madness-** That's right Apes, its time to sports gamble. March is here and America will be throwing millions away on overgrown chimps who like a round ball and betting outrageous amounts of cash on hunches, alumni connections &amp; stimi checks coming. Now, BFT/Paysafe is used by the big boys of online gambling too. I have put photos below that show the online gambling paysafe connections. With recent dip in market, SPAC's got wiped out. This went from $18-$19ish a stock to $12.50 last week...back to $15 but with March Madness it will rise with the tide ($DKNG uses them too)

📷

Gambling/ online sports betting. Take a bet on idiots betting will grow. You like $Penn and $DKNG, then you should love $BFT

3) **Merger Date-** Get your calendars out you autist. March 25th. BFT will vote to merge and become PSFE. Now if you don't know much about big dick bill and SPAC's...the man is not known to miss. He isn't here to fuck spiders or eat rocks. He gets things done &amp; this is his biggest puppy. ALL news (please share if you find otherwise) is pointing to this Merging &amp; once it breaks away from SPAC, I think the massess will be BUYING. Institutions have not been able to get their greedy fingers on this yet, but I think when they can, they will eat this up. 

📷

If you can read, please do

Now before you spit all your crayons out at once and say whats the catch, the catch is this is a VERY VERY competitive market. Their main competitors are Paypal &amp; Square, but based on EBITDA Paysafe is still **VERY VERY UNDERVALUED.** The gamble/Pro I see here is that Paysafe focuses more on Igaming and gambling, so if you think in next few years this will grow, then this is your horse.

📷

If you can't count, it means that at same valuation/growth as Paypal they are minimum $35 stock...Square closer to $45.

Now there are ALOT of smarter apes than me and much more detail online about technicals, growth etc but this is what I see happening. A formula for tendies if you will short term. If you have your own bias, please share in comments. It should also be noted that as a SPAC, institutions haven't been able to get their slimy hands on it, which again will result in long-term growth as I see them EATING this up.

\*Roblox IPO + March Madness + Merger + Market recovery with stimi + Hedges beginning to pick up positions + experts saying fair-value/floor is $26 (lowest I could find)\****= 60% upside on boomer stonks or 5x on calls in next month. I see end of April, $30+ for the stock.***

*Positions: 380 shares at $13.50 15x $15c 10/15/21 (bought on dip) &amp; continuing to add 5x 4/16/21 $15.5 and 20x 4/16/21 $20c*

69,m1a908,"Wanted to provide some DD on a company that I feel has potential, $FSLR (First Solar).

I noticed this company after I received an alert about unusual options activity:

&gt;$FSLR 5/21/2021 $70  
Type: CALLS  
Order: 926 @ 10.94   
Premium: $1,012,806   
Underlying: $76.55   
Daily Volume: 943   
OI: 46

Someone is clearly making a big bet that this company is going to be on the rise over the coming months. This company wasn't on my radar before, so after digging and research, I placed a similar call order. There has been a significant dip over the past few and I believe this is a good buy-in point for a few reasons outlined below.

**Price target:** $85.82 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/))

**What they do:**

First Solar designs, develops, manufactures and markets a line of thin-film semiconductor photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules that convert sunlight into electricity.

**Analyst's Investment Thesis:**

&gt;We believe that First Solar is well positioned for future growth based on its solid balance sheet and focus on cadmium telluride technology, which should provide a cost advantage relative to more commoditized technologies like polysilicon.  The company is also benefiting from an expanding opportunity set of utility-scale projects. First Solar's balance sheet is clean and it has a solid book of contracted projects heading into the next few years. First Solar could also be an attractive acquisition target for an integrated oil company looking to bolster its renewable operations. We caution, however, that FSLR shares have a history of volatility, and that any sales or earnings disappointment could result in a sharp selloff. As such, we view FSLR as appropriate only for risk-tolerant investors as part of a diversified portfolio.

Solar is a growing industry, so placing a bet on any front-runner in this space isn't a bad play.

- &gt;*""Many questioned whether the coordinated trading of Reddit-inspired investors constituted market manipulation from a legal standpoint and what if anything the SEC should or could do in response.""* 

- Not the abusive short-selling of 140% of the companies available float to suppress the price and put the company out of business. 

- &gt;*But, beyond the stark question of whether this constitutes illegal manipulation, the GameStop incident highlights the ways in which social media and technology have combined to push the limits of market regulations. It also calls into question to what extent existing understandings of manipulation can adequately respond to and, ultimately, deter the type of misconduct that may have occurred*

- ""Social Media and Technology are to be blamed, but our current laws don't capture this""

- &gt;*There ought to be consequences for using internet platforms and social media to encourage others to buy/sell stock, if result is a price that is so distorted as to be completely divorced from the company’s fundamentals.*

- Reads like salt.

- &gt;*The type of coordinated action among thousands of dispersed, small-dollar investors that was seen during GameStop’s rise was not imaginable when courts and regulators first conceptualized the market power needed to squeeze or corner the markets.*

- ""Small-dollar Investors"" did this. 🤡

- &gt;*The [SEC's] refusal to act lead many to wonder why trading in GameStop stock was not halted once it became clear that the stock price was completely and unjustifiably divorced from the company’s fundamentals.*

- If she's arguing it should've been halted on the upswing due to being ""divorced from fundamentals"", then it should've equally been halted on the downswing when HF's were naked shorting it 140% of the available float. GTFO.

- &gt;*Thus, while increased retail participation is laudable, it is imperative to consider how to protect retail investors from unsuitable investments that they neither understand nor appreciate the risks.* 

- We don't need your protection, I'll lose my money however I please.

Her testimony goes on for pages, but it's basically more of the same. You can see her perspective, focus, and who she stands for. Hint, its not us.

- &gt;*When the GameStop-Robinhood episode occurred in January, I was immediately reminded of the MIT Blackjack Team of the 1990s [...] Like the MIT students, the Redditors in January were young, knowledgeable people with high appetites for risk who chose to collectively speculate by making quick bets against a larger player with a perceived advantage.*

- Nah fam. We bought the stock because we like the company. The short squeeze was always a bonus.

- Reads like a r/selfawarewolves post.

Not much substance to this testimony, although she does make it a point to lump Redditors/social media investors as dangers to the market.

- &gt;*Accordingly, I focus my testimony on the market structure and market infrastructure issues that have been raised in the aftermath of the January trading.*

- I think this pretty much says everything we need to know. Primarily focuses on settlement times and PFOF. Largely unrelated to circumstances/investigating GME.

- &gt;*My testimony will address (1) the recent trading activity in the common stock of GameStop Corp. and a few other companies, (2) securities trading platforms such as Robinhood Financial, and (3) considerations for further action. My conclusion is that the information currently available has not revealed a problem of sufficient severity to justify Congress imposing new regulations in these areas.*

- Regulation the focus.

- &gt;*The events surrounding the changes in prices for GameStop and the questions about the Robinhood trading platform have so far not revealed the kind of problem that would justify new legal estrictions
or regulations*

Well done chaps. This is what has been all about the whole time - making the headgies bleed. I bet some intern who was talking up shorting $GME is getting his ass chewed out. Especially recently this push has been something short of magnificent. Almost a 100% gain in the past couple days, it is starting to feel like January all over again.

95,m1abjw,"220$ a share. A couple months ago, I was some dipshit depressed failson without hope or ambition. My life felt like a death sentence, one where I would sit at a desk for 50 years as some corporate drone so that I can afford to eat before I die. 

Then, Gamestonk. Game stonk became hope, it became a test, “am I brave enough to risk losing it all on a chance?”
I put every penny I had, 3K at 220 per share into Gamestonk. It was my first stock, ever.

It changed me. It made me brave. Holding through thick and thin. Solidarity with the community. The experience of buying and holding Gamestonk literally gave me the strength and courage to face my gender and begin transitioning. Now I’m a trans commie cat girl uwu and I fucking love this stock! 

To all the fellow retards on this sub. I love you, thank you. I spent years around “supportive spaces” and never felt half the solidarity I’ve experienced here. This community is something truly special. I really thought I’d lost the 3K in the process. But no, you guys actually came back for me, back to the frankly insane price I paid per share. Not only have I discovered an amazing community and my true self, I’m actually going to make money on this ticking crazy bullshit....or I would, if I ever sold.............
