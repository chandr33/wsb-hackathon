12,m6g8fv,"Hello retards,

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a French retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other.  In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng 🧻🙌). It also trigger stop loose (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE? 

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data 🖍️ to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions. 

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our 🌈🐻.

* ***🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸*** 

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people 💖) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge PUMP tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win ! 

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose ! 

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet :  “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.” 

PL:TR: Price down cause of short sells and 🧻🙌 ----&gt; Solution = Buy now and hold 💎🙌 for going to 🚀🌑

I like the stock (16.56@216)

13,m6g8hn,"I'm thinking about investing into WeWork when it goes public through an SPAC.

They failed at going public last year after poor management of finances and ouster of their CEO, and when the pandemic hit and everyone worked at home, it looked like it was over for them.

Since then, WeWork has been getting its shit together, and looks more like a real estate company, aka something real.

So less exciting but possibly profitable, good for stock market.

Here's why I think about investment (am ape):

* I've worked from home for 10 years and know how fatiguing it gets. About 3 years in I started splitting my time between home and Starbucks's.
* However, SBUX sucks for extended WFH and the vibe sucks. Traditional offices are gross and stuffy.
* Coworking spaces are generally better and WeWork is easily the best, albeit expensive. Proof? Go to Santa Monica. I toured 10 coworking spaces in SM a few years ago and they all were TERRIBLE except for 3- WeWork, ROC, and this spot Obama spoke at once. I chose ROC. They evicted all their tenants after not paying their sublease bill.
* Most WFHers have started to experience this kind of fatigue, but I think they're still early on the fatigue and we'll see that more.
* If post-pandemic, we see a net bump in permanent WFH and remote workers, there will be a greater need for good coworking spaces. And WeWork wins. Especially if most of these permanent WFHers are not in the same city as their employer, where WeWork gets their customers in company hubs in multiple cities.
* If post-pandemic, we instead see any net increase WFH coming from people living in the city, aka partial WFH, they'll probably just come into the office to get out of the house instead of a coworking space.

So (more responsible WeWork + to-be-seen WFH fatigue) \* (probability of post-pandemic WFH) = buy

No clue about the specifics of these numbers or evidence that WeWork got their head out their ass.

I am somewhat new to the world of investing in stocks. 

The EV company SOLO caught my eye originally because of the show ‘Upload’.  Strange that the premise of the show revolves around one of their vehicle malfunctioning but nonetheless it is a high profile show featuring their vehicles.

For a long time the discussion as to where their US plant would be places drove the price. Today it was announced they are opening the plant in Mesa, AZ and an office in Phoenix. Link below.
