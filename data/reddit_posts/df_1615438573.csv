&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1: Laying the Groundwork**

I've read through an unhealthy amount of posts since early January invoking what I can only summarize as ape-ish behavior. Lots of laughing, crying, but most importantly tons of masturbating to gain and loss porn, which reminds me I need to find something for tonight. Any way here's what I've taken from the vast array of posts I've read through. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Short Interest -** No one really knows where the SI figure actually lies, but we can all agree it is excessive. According to the latest Finra report GameStop has a float of 54m shares and SI of 52%. I know horseshit when I smell it and fuck this stinks! Shorts losing nearly a billion dollars in one day off of low SI numbers doesn't add up.

[Finra Markets GME Quote - 3\/9 Update](https://preview.redd.it/7ceoy1q9nbm61.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ddfebe5540ac9582144c9cc463d9e059bf84a1)

* **Current Ownership -** The GameStop saga is global and there are currently 9.5m degenerates in this sub alone. It's not hard to imagine that there are 10m people holding 5 shares out of the hundreds of millions of eyes that have been on this worldwide. That alone is the entire float. Now we need to look at institutional ownership. Institutional ownership accounts for another 200% of the float! Fintel also seems to be retarded so I finished their graph for today's close. From my understanding some of this institutional ownership does include a degree of double counts on shorts. Whether or not the short interest is captured by the institutional ownership figures doesn't matter at this point, I can't read between the lines anyway. All of the above considered let's call the total ownership 150m or 300% float.

[Fintel.io GME Institutional Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/r9ommro5pbm61.png?width=2184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb6c45fed0f54c1975077d2b76746cef5088625)

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Trading History and Pushes to $400 Threshold** 

&amp;#x200B;

1. On January 27th GME peaked at 380, fell to 249, and recovered closing at 347. 
2. On January 28th GME roared to over 500 premarket before sharply falling, opening at 265. Then climbing again to reach a peak of 483 before unraveling during a time we'd all like to forget about while multiple brokerages deliberately and drastically removed demand from the equation. 
3. Today, March 10th GME continued it's week long print sesh of endless brr steadily climbing to 348 before having it's legs cut off and falling to an intraday low of 172 and recovering to close at 265.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Connecting the Dots**

&amp;#x200B;

Ask yourself what do the 3 days above have in common? All 3 days shares of GME approached and/or hovered in the $400 threshold. All 3 days shares of GME experienced sudden and drastic losses during huge buying momentum.. fuck loss porn I'll just masturbate to today's red candle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm.. looks to me as if GME getting past the $400 threshold is bad news for someone, can't imagine who? So I pulled out my crayons and after connecting a few dots it dawned on me that $400 had to be the margin call threshold for enough of the total short position to ignite the **M.O.A.S.S.** simultaneously fueled by gamma squeezing. Have you guys seen the outrageous amount of open interest on the casino board? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4: Galaxy Brain \*\*\*Tinfoil Hat Required\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

It's not far fetched for the total ownership including short interest to be 3-10x the total float. This could spell possible market-wide chaos if large entities are forced to liquidate assets to cover their positions at astronomical prices as they're squeezed dry for delicious tendies. Mutual funds, endowments, 401K's and personal retirement funds, etc. possibly wiped out as their irresponsible managing firms sell off because they were too greedy, twisted, and pulled the lever so hard it got stuck down.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the Plunge Protection Team (PPT) [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp) Essentially a deep state group called on once or twice a decade to play god with our beloved stonks. Shrouded in the shadows the PPT could have been acting in the broader American market's best interest by correcting the price of certain securities as they reached potentially dangerous levels. Not once or twice but three times GME was a speeding bullet train that had it's track pulled out from under, keeping it from ripping past the moon or Valhalla and straight to the fucking tendie vaults. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 5: What You Impatient Fucks Have Been Waiting For**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Scenario 1 -** The size of the short position and number of naked shorts amongst other fuckery is so big a **M.O.A.S.S.** would unravel the American markets. GameStop continues to be decapitated anytime it is in or around the $400 threshold. Tomorrow GME will be on the short sale restricted list and any daft drops similar to the ones we've seen would not be the actions of very large short sales but rather divine intervention commonly referred to as **Deep State Fuckery**. Improvise, adapt, overcome. Start playing the casino board with this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Scenario 2 -** The powers that be decide 3 times is enough and they can't delay launch sequences any longer, they'll have to learn from the shady activity of large players in the market and the mistakes made. GameStop flies 4.367 light years to Alpha Centauri.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I hope to see familiar faces in Alpha Centauri. I heard it's nice this time of year.

54,m2ig7d," Ok you beautiful fuckers, I am just an ape and this is not Financial Advice. Seriously, don't take advice from me, I'm 'tarded just like the rest of you.

Let's start with what I think happened today. Unlike most apes on here think, it wasn't massive shorts that caused that dip. No, in my opinion, it was a massive stock selloff from the hedge funds. If you're wondering how, it's because they've been buying alongside us for the last little while. I was wondering why we were shooting up day by day, facing little to no resistance. And, I also found it strange how GME was no longer trading inverse to the market. I'm sure some of you were noticing that too. How could things be going so smoothly, with GME and just about every other stock? Because this was all planned. They've been helping us pump up the price.

What's the good news? The good news is, they can only do that so many times. In my estimation, they will only be able to do that once more (and even then, it's questionable if they have the resources). Also, since IB is reporting a low amount of shorts remaining, it won't be possible to push the price down like this in any other fashion. And according to some other apes on here, we're on the Short-Sale Rule list tomorrow... So everyone remember to buy $CUM, $BBC, $BBW, and any other stocks of that like.

But seriously, why would they buy alongside us? Well, it's been theorized on here by several different users. I'd credit them, but I don't know their usernames. I have seen predictions that an attack like this may be made as far back as during the first round of GME. As for the 'Why', well the why is simple. They wanted to shake paperhands. They thought they could crash this thing like they did at the end of Round 1, when things started to fall from $300ish. But it didn't work. And this tells us everything we need to know.

The important things to note are 1)We have a safe buying wall around the $250 to $260 level (Thank God, love you fellow apes!) 2)According to IBorrowDesk (At time of writing), there are only 150,000 shares available for shorting. 3)There are new shorts around the $260 level today, as well as some other up around $340. The lower shorts should help push us up. 4)This whole crash strategy was super risky for them to undertake. Not only could they have lost a lot of money, but the whole thing could backfire and ""renew"" belief in GME.

To address point 4. Very simply, you wouldn't buy 1.5 Million shares of GME and attempt to crash it if you were covered, would you? The answer is no. And, you wouldn't risk losing money on such a massive gamble, unless it could save you money elsewhere, correct? I think that's also correct. And perhaps MOST IMPORTANTLY. If they were worried about increasing the price, but felt they had to buy shares to attempt this strategy (which would in turn, help increase the price and also increase faith in GME), then they absolutely would not do that. The strategy is too risky. Unless.... They had no other choice.

Ladies and Gentleman, I think that's the exact scenario. This was their last major tool to throw everyone off. It didn't work. Not even close. Sure, they may use short ladders going forward. And hell, if they get too desperate, they may try this strategy at a higher value. But they crashed it, paid writers to write hit pieces, and sent the bots and shills out in full force to make us feel like we ""Missed the squeeze"". Fuck you, we didn't miss shit.

So, what now? We buy, and we hold. And remember, Short-Sale Rule list tomorrow. I believe the way we start the day will set the tone of the whole thing. And we need belief in our fellow apes. So hold on like your wife's boyfriend holds onto her ass, and buy as much as you can. Let's bust the lower shorts, and go back for the retards above $400. The moon is next.

2. The retail trader held the line well today. This shows an increasing support as apes double and even triple down.

3. Institutions (whales 🐳 ) helping the retail trader. The institutions see this and are seizing the opportunity to ride the big gamma squeeze up with retail traders.

4. More and more people learning about the gamma squeeze every day. They are telling their friends and family. Day and swing traders are even taking advantage of GME volatility. 

5. Paper hands are learning their lesson. After suffering through the worst of it, diamond hands are stronger than ever. They simply don’t give a fuck about the dips anymore.

66,m2ijoe,"If you haven't read that Forbes article that came out today, you should. It's really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this GME growth, and why it will continue: www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/

However, it also gave me an idea of what happened today and I want some feedback on the theoretical, and thoughts on why they wouldn't just keep doing this.

The article describes the price rise driven by the need for MM to cover calls. If they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock, that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered. After two weeks of heavy call volume, they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print. Let's say they're average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250.

I don't understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose, so apologies if I'm drifting off base.

So if I'm sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and I know I can't stop the increasing price, why not flood the market with those million shares I have so the price plummets, and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering ITM calls? It would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls... Charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount.

So in this scenario, they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300, banking that $25 premium, but since they NEED those shares for delivery, and aren't willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed, they buy them back at an average of $225, $25 less than the average call strike.

They net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls. If they're smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis.

So... Can someone tell me why this wouldn't work? Or why it's probably not what happened. Because I'm sitting here, after the fact, thinking to myself, ""if I was an evil fuck, with loads of money to push shit around, and I don't want to lose  any of it, what would I do?"" And this is exactly what I would do.

And if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened, what's to stop them from doing it every week? I know it doesn't hurt us financially (just psychologically) if we hold through it, but it will eventually scare more and more people away. What's the recourse?
