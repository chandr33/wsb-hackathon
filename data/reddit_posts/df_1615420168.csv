2,m2cltm,"Want to create a post that’s sole purpose is to comment questions or answers about GME. Had a convo w my friend who is my age (25) but thinks like a boomer. So, he’s been wrong all his life. Neither of us budged for 3 hours but I realize our knowledge may not equate to some OG’s here. His thing was that profit, despite the revenue, makes GME extremely unattractive and no numbers, even the 200%+ increase in e-commerce tells you “nothing” because the profit is still in negatives. I tell him stop trusting the suits but I need more help. 

For reference, I’m still holding. Went from $500 to $30,000 and fell w the crash, kept holding to $1k and then reached a peak today at 17k and now at 10k which is improved from yesterday’s and no way in paper-handing this. Contract is 900c 2023 exp. Sorry couldn’t afford shares in the beginning and technically, I’m still unemployed so deff can’t afford shares now. 

Some guidelines maybe (do what you want, I’m not you mom nor a financial advisor) 

If you post a rocket, maybe share a number to help the bill thesis 
If you’re a bear (lol, cool story bro), somehow share w me a number that isn’t just their physical stores

I strongly believe the fundamentals and the momentum are excellent for this to go wherever it can go. 

If anything, this can help the FACT that people doing this are educated. We aren’t just apes. We are also professor Farnsworth’s monkey that was smarter then everyone else on Mars University.","Post for GME questions, fundamentals and technical",1.0,1615420202,Right_Instance7991

8,m2cmrd,"Let me start off by saying this group has actually, and literally, changed my life.

I have a 6-year-old son that is actually Autistic (which makes me laugh considering what we label ourselves here. My son doesn't understand it, but he still laughs and thinks you're all like him). Every day he starts his day by jumping in the bed to wake me up before school. He gets ready to go to school. He says he loves me. He is happy and tells me about his day on the way home. We come inside. And he does something that most 6-year olds wouldn't want to do: Watches the markets go up and down on GME.

I'm starting to think his kid is a savant for this. He will do something funny, like jump around, do a dance, or high-five me when he thinks the stock will go up. He will do something sad, like start tearing up, run in the corner, or get real quiet and put his hands in his face when he thinks the stock will go down. Today, he had a full-blown meltdown. And then, he was quickly happy again when he saw the stock go back up.

He comes from a father who survived cancer, and a mother who didn't have the easiest childhood, yet here is this kid, Autism and all, who is literally the happiest, most caring kid you would ever meet in your life. He will randomly sometimes ask me, ""Do you like this stock?"" and I just laugh and go yes. And every time I go ""to the moon!"" he puts his hands up and goes ""to the moon, daddy!"". I tear up. Every..single..time.

I just wanted to post this and say the memes you guys post, the information you guys provide, the laughs and well-wishes you all give, it doesn't go unnoticed. That's worth any amount of money, lost or gained, I will ever see. My son, if he knew how to articulate it to you, would thank you guys to the moon and back (or not back, because we're staying there).

He wanted me to tell you guys he loves you. Oh, and if we somehow can break $300 tomorrow.. I will record him yelling ""to the moon"" for you guys. Because you all should smile as much as I do since this train started.

Hello everybody and welcome. This is going to be my first extended post here. I’ll try to keep it short and simple as I want to share with you just a couple of useful things...

If you seen any writing mistake, I’m sorry.
I’m from Europe, and I study economics. The great thing about economics is that you learn to know that world is much more about behaviour than actual numbers, I’ve also did and internship on a stock broker so I learn to know a few things about their trades, order flows etc. On the way, I’ve meet some pretty nice people that taught mesome pretty good lessons you can all apply this times and in your brilliant future as crayons eaters and big money makers.

Rule 1: THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH 1️⃣

So, please don’t get discouraged when we see dips like this today, you don’t expect them to just give up done you? Get ready for war, they will bring a lot of tricks, social blackout, SS ladders, no updated, wrong info etc etc like we’ve saw in the past. Today on my phone it was marking 17:34 (European hours) and on yahoo finance the last updated was 17:29, and this is supposed to be updated every second. I might be completely wrong but it looks like that not everybody is going to their brokers/bank app to check the price all the time, personally i don’t, I rely on yahoo etc. If your a paper hand, you get excited (watch my next point) to see price almost on $350, app stop updating and then you see it almost on $200, what you think weak people will do? Sell!! They know how to play with your mind, and speed up your heart rate to you take bad decisions. I.E. paper hand and sell.

Rule 2: A ANGRY MIND IS A LIMITED MIND 2️⃣

Stay cool guys, remember what you felt when price was as $40 after you bought at peak and this guys cheated and switched of the plug? I bet a lot of your were feeling like shtt, terrible and the worst, you were feeling dumb. Some of you started to think you could have spend the money in another thousand ways, feeling embarrassed and some of theme even accepted that loss and sold. So what about now, when stock was at $350? You were excited, feeling crazy, feeling you did the best choice of your life in holding (which in fact you did ahah). My point here is that, this humor switches are now healthy for you, stay cool, don’t be that guy that went to the casino, lost on roulette and gets angry, no, it is supposed to be fun. So choose you side, either betting or not, stay cool, when loosing and when winning, your making 100/200/300% in a day, great, keep going, your losing, great, you knew the risks hold and keep going. You have to control your emotions, either positive and negative, of course this is easier said than done but think about this next time you’re close to the extreme of one of these two types of emotions, stay neutral, and never take decisions based on emotion!

Rule 3: KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR YOU 3️⃣

Today i was having classes (online), so in Europe we wake up before pre market starts in USA, and once it opened, few min later it was up already 10/15% and I start wondering, why check the every 5 min? It will have ups and downs and it will only increase the likelihood of taking a irrational decisions and messing with your mind. So for me. I never check the price more than once every one/two hours. Will the price go from $300 to $500.000 in 60/120 minutes? We would need at least 70 halts of 10 min, that’s a lot of hours... by doing this you reduce the stress you put on yourself, screen fatigue is a really matter, we used to speak about it on the broker i was all the time. That was a trader there that was only trading on daily charts, this guys was trading heavy amounts of money I can tell you. You know what this guys was doing after placing the trades? Get home, get his dog and take a walk, what a fkng king. He told me this kept him way of screen fatigue, kept him chill, not looking to ups and downs and on the end of the day there is only two options, either you win or you lose. (Well, with GME you can only win) So why bother in the middle? You made your game plane, your DD, you know your target, just leave and stop feeding you body with anxiety, you’ll pay the price in 10/20 years!

Rule 4: NUMBERS NEVER LIE 4️⃣

Have you every study the beauty contest theory? I recommend you to take a look on YouTube or something, there is always something behind the numbers, nothing is happing just because. And mass behaviour shapes everything. This volume on selling was incredible high, no any paper hands would do it, this was heavy short and stop/trailing stop getting activated, I used to see that a lot on the broker. You know were these numbers are so you just need to move in that direction! So, don’t do it guys, be smart, you are not playing against a kid in the backyard, there guys know how to mess the thing ups, don’t make their life easier. Start to think, if I were on their shoes, what would I do? And then ask again, “what I’m about to do makes sense” setting stop loss in this one makes 0 sense wtf, your just letting them know where you want do get out. This is not Apple, boys, this is GME, wild ride, ride or die.

So, to sum up, don’t expect this to go straight to 500k, it will have a lot of fights in between, if you don’t have stomach for this, then your about the be a slave in the world! Nothing comes free and the higher this going with higher will be the volatile and the swings, I can tell you they prefer to go bankrupt than to say they lost, can you imagine what would happen if they admited that they lost? There would be no more game from them. (That’s what is going to be anyways). So, expect them to try everything, everytrick, things i don’t even saw and don’t know how, this is just playing, the real war doesn’t even begun, trust me,but guess what????

I have my plan, HOLDING TFU chilled

SO CHILL MY GUYS, don’t over complicate, get ready to see heads rolling in the street, jump on dips if you want and can, If not, seat down and enjoy the ride, you’ll remember this for the rest of your life!!

GOOD LUCK

Could hedge funds theoretically sell thousands of shares at inflated prices ($344) to drive the price down and then re buy them at the crash ($190)?

Theoretically that means they would have made $60x the shares they rebought at the lower price.

Are we just an infinite money pool for hedge funds to cash in on?

28,m2cq2d,"I read the AMC earnings report and I feel very sick. This company is not going to survive long term. The old man CEO took big pay for nothing but shifting the debt around and selling more shares on the cheap. Diluted share count, 10.5% coupon in a low interest environment. May possibly a good short term trade but I see it as a very short term trade that may have already happened.

GME has a much better balance sheet, a younger vibrant bunch with vision and clearly more support from Reddit.  GME all the way. Not sure if it can sustain this rally but the company has much better long term prospects fundamentally in this mental market.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you have done DD on both GME and AMC and have come to the same conclusion that GME is a better company with better prospects than AMC.

30,m2cqjz,"Hi retards. I'm too new to comment and this is my first post. When that shit went down today at lunchtime, I didn't know what to think. Honestly, that scared the shit out of me. (Full disclosure - I was holding 4 shares at an average of $53ish. I'm poor but I'm a poor retard.) All the significant gains from this morning vanished.

I didn't understand the sudden huge dip, I just knew i lost gains. I also have 98 shares of AMC @ $9.15, and I watched that price drop from $12 back to $9 or whatever. I was stunned and spent my lunch staring at my phone, trying to understand what the fuck happened.

So what did I do? Did I sell and salvage what was left? No. The limit buy I had set up this morning for 6 more shares at $250 (which I figured was useless given the quick start, kicked in and I averaged up). I'm glad I didn't cancel it. If the nonsense hadn't happened, I wouldn't have 6 more shares, but my 4 original shares would be worth a shitload.

Bottom line, I'm pissed off at the monkey business, despite being an ape. However, now I have 10 shares and I'm not fucking selling them. I know I'm a small fish but I'm still going to get my gold plated bananas in the end. So thanks hedgefucks, can't wait to see some rich pricks go bankrupt and some retard apes get rich.

This community is awesomesauce, I'm looking forward to eventually being able to comment and ask questions so I can learn to ape better. Thanks in advance for not deleting this.

We have been building stairs up for days now even with lower volume than last time. The reason this dropped today was traitors taking profits after a month of stress, as well as whales potentially buying shares and dumping them setting off a chain reaction and stop loss raid. Well guess what, it barely worked. We are still building new support levels and rising in a similar pattern to last time, only much larger. I see positive sentiment and FOMO everywhere I look, I see stronk apes hodling, and whales buying up every dip. I have never been more confident that the people who held through today can hold through anything. Those who decided to wait to take profits will be rewarded by insane green days starting tomorrow. I believe we will see $400, but what would be even better is if we continued to move up slowly with less volatility.
