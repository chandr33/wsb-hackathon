**Obligatory**

**This isn't a trading advice nor am I a financial advisor. You do your own trades and make your own decision about your investment. This is just for educational purposes only.**

According to this article on order book I just skimmed over, [http://www.personal.psu.edu/qxc2/research/jfuturesmarkets-2008.pdf](http://www.personal.psu.edu/qxc2/research/jfuturesmarkets-2008.pdf)

"" *order book is moderately informative—its contribution to price discovery is approximately 22%. The remaining 78% is from the best bid and offer prices on the book and the last transaction price.* ""

It's been said that the 80% of the current market is traded by Algos.

I believe Algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons.

1. Crazy amount of short interest
2. HF's are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist.
3. WSB retards are putting $69,420 for sell orders which are fucking up the HFT traders.

1.

It is estimated that retail holds about MINIMUM 30-40% of the float (estimation of 4 million people around the world holding just 3 shares each.) and institutions hold **122.04%** according to yahoo. Short % of the float is about 60% of the float which means around 25million shares are borrowed and sold on the market.

If half of GME holders and half of institutions are **💎🙌** s that means about 80% of the float is locked in **💎🙌** . This makes short interest waaaaaay higher than what is actually reported. If short interest is 60% which is 25million and float is 20% of the actual float, that makes the short interest **277%.** There's just not enough shares for short seller to cover because most of the shares are just fucking locked in.

2.

So these HF's who have to cover due to either share recall or losing money, they make up counterfeit shares from their off-shore account to buy the counterfeited shares and covering them. That way they can trick the fail-to-deliver numbers and show the SEC that they ""covered"" using shares that don't even fucking exist. (read this webpage on counterfeiting shares that I just skimmed over to get an overview of how counterfeiting stocks is done. [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=Naked%20Short%20%E2%80%94%20This%20is%20an,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=Naked%20Short%20%E2%80%94%20This%20is%20an,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).)

I believe they have gotten to a point where there are **literally close to 0 Shares available on the market to cover** and this is fucking with the algos because the reason number 3.

3.

WSB retards are putting $800-$69,420 orders and Algos are trying to get the lowest priced shares to cover short selling for HF's while skimming through non-existent shares that are currently being traded on the market but it obviously doesn't all go through because HF's probably have some another Algo to prevent some weird anomaly shit from happening. Now they can't cover at those numbers or they'd be out of money in 5 minutes. (Similar event actually happened back in 2012 where HFT made a company called Knight Capital to lose $440m in just 45 minutes [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19214294](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19214294) In summary the Algos just started buying high and selling low lol) So what do they do? they have to make fake shares again until either retail or institutions sell their locked up shares.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk now I'll take any questions.

**TLDR.**

I believe Algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons.

1. Crazy amount of short interest
2. HF's are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist.
3. WSB retards are putting $69,420 for sell orders which are fucking up the HFT traders.",Theory on why GME is showing weird numbers on order book,0.85,1614828410,op9466

75,lxbmid,"Quick question to everyone that was involved, on the morning of the 27th, were you able to trade options at 9:30 am?

I have a trade dispute with my broker and they are claiming that the primary market didn't open until 9:43 am and trading options a few seconds after that at a price of $297 which is when I could sell. However, I show on NYSE and Gamestop's investor relations that the opening price was $354.

I was up and active in the pre-market watching the price and when open happened I was unable to sell my options until \~15 minutes later. I saw volume on the ticker during those times and the price of the options change on other brokerage platforms.

If anyone knows of any website with historical options trade information or at the very least can corroborate what I saw (maybe even trade data) I would greatly appreciate it. The dispute is for a large sum and I don't want to have to go FINRA arbitration.

**Edit: Due to my low karma I am unable to directly reply to the comments. I want to assert that they are trying to say that the NASDAQ did not open until 9:43 AM EST and I believe that to be false based on other brokerage price action (Robinhood/Webull).**

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2: I did some digging based on** u/meta-cognizant **suggestion of marketchameleon. I downloaded the options transaction log for 01/27/2021 and to my surprise my brokerage is 100% absolutely correct which blew my mind. Options did not start trading until 9:43:52 AM.**
