This is a once in a lifetime chance to get back what was taken from us and our parents for decades. I am not saying to never sell, if you are unsure take out one share to cover your initial investment at some point.

They need our shares! Most likely even several times.

Okay so saw a dd on clean corp energy a while back. It was great. Bought in a couple of shares. It dipt like the rest. Sad hours. But now they had a earnings report of the fourth quarter of 2020 and they anounced that they made a deal with bp and total. Great news for the company. Plus the company has beat their expectations and predicted 71 million revenue but got 74,5 million. Again good for the company. They are bright about 2021 and i just wanted to inform the apes that wanted too know about another stock that can be a great long term invest like $BB.

Of course my choice is GME, even though 500 might not be much, when I see your portfolios on here.

Probably a lot of people will sell when it starts to drop or when it stays constant.

If I understood correctly, that will lower the price.
But when the prices are getting low, will people start to invest again and rise the price then with that, resulting in another spike?

Or will there be one massive spike and then it'll die out? Is it still worth it to invest rn with only 500€?

I'm a bit slow anyways, so I would gladly join to be a retard too, since it suits me quite well. 
I have no previous experience in investing and he only a little bit.
Is there also anything you would recommend me to do or not to do? Are there other older companies which will be pushed and are currently low price?

38,m1venl,"Hello all, 

Like a lot of you in here, I'm also new to investing. I've been learning a lot from this community. There are so many helpful, and well-versed people in this sub. They helped direct me towards being confident in going with Fidelity. I've been making a few short hold trades, just to build up my financial strength and buying power. One thing I realized when reading a lot of the comments is individuals selling shares, and using those proceeds to immediately invest in another stock.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to point out, and while I myself am still learning so correct me if I am wrong please, once we sell a stock for proceeds, we have to wait about two business dates from the date of selling to allow those proceeds to become settled cash before we invest that money back into another stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe with Fidelity, you are allowed 3 Good Faith Violations before your account is restricted for three months. I just wanted to point this out as a heads up for newer investors, like myself, who up until a week ago didn't even realize this was a rule!
