2,lwzcjo,"GME AMC Due Dili Wed 3/3 12PM EST short borrow rates and availability

At 12:00PM EST The borrowing cost rate on GME slightly dropped and AMC has moved UP  vs. my last report (Monday 3/1).

GAMESTOP CORP. -2.914%/APR

AMC ENTERTAINMENT -4.661%/APR

While these rates are slightly different than my prior reported rates and much lower than &gt;20% APR rates a few weeks ago, any marked-up rates from  'general collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to some extent. Note this AM there was no problem borrowing GME but NO borrow available of AMC shares at these rates. Throughout last week mid-day, there were either no shares to borrow of these two securities or required a call to  my account rep, meaning shares were available earlier in AM but may be  fully committed at that point in the day.

Hope this info is helpful and now go forth and make some money.",GME AMC Due Dili Wed 3/3 12PM EST short borrow rates and availability,0.79,1614792476,ValueEvangelist

51,lwzh7u,"Alright so my thesis here is 3-fold for the RV/Camper market and specifically Winnebago (ticker WGO):

1. Covid Shut Down Everything and Introduced People To Camping - At my former tech job I worked with a lot of data and one thing I noticed around Covid time is that there was a huge spike for searches related to campers and camping. Check Google trends for ""Camper"" ""RV"" etc and look at it on a 5 year horizon. The growth is explosive in the camping market. Camping is a hobby that once people get into it, they typically continue to do it just has a high barrier to get people to try the first time.

I've even seen this reflected in my everyday interactions with friends and family. I had several friends and family recently purchase new or used RVs or campers so they could get out of the city to do stuff during COVID. These were people that NEVER camped before in their lives and now they regularly take out a camper or an RV. There is huge new demand from this market and the reports from the dealers have been extremely positive. Look around your friends and family and odds are you will see the same. (This strategy of paying attention to what people are starting to buy is from One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch)

2) Millennials and younger people love travel vans and tiny houses which are basically a form of a camper - Many times the best products are ones that are simply reintroduced to the public under different marketing. Look at foam mattresses. These were actually around in the 1980s but were recently introduced with better marketing by Casper and took off. My thesis is that an RV/Camper is basically better than a tiny house in every way and Winnebago sells premade travel Vans. Why build a tiny house when you could instead invest in a used RV which has decades of user feedback to perfect these small living units on wheels?

Also I've seen some people my age (29) who can work from home who have been traveling the nation in a camper while they work. They spend a week in each town/RV park and work out of their camper during the day.

3) Valuation - Right now Winnebago trades at a market cap of $2.45B so it's definitely a small cap and has a P/E ratio of 23.5 vs the S&amp;P 500 average of \~39 currently. Given their recent great earnings for the past two quarters and their very solid continued growth prospects this seems like the stock should be trading much higher imo. Now this isn't a short squeeze situation where you are going to get 90% gains overnight but I'm looking at a solid return over the next 12 months.

Disclosure: This idea is retarded but I'm very long WGO. Also this likely applies to other camper/RV companies but I'm not as familiar with them. I'm from Iowa so I know a decent amount about management and how WGO is run so I feel the most confident with them.

There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&amp;T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT.

""Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.""

Marketplace: 5G is clearly the future of many industries. Autonomous cars (EV), Cellular, Energy, Agriculture, etc all willsoonrelyon5Gstructuredcommunications. GSATencompassesallofthese. The 5G market alone is expected to be worth over 667 Billion dollars in 5 years. This is not even including the EV space, which relies heavily on secure communications (aka GSAT) The Market is setup for a dominant, trusted company like GSAT to overtake.

Leadership:

David Kagan Chief Executive Officer David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC.

L. Barbee Ponder IV General Counsel and Vice President of Regulatory Mr. Ponder has previously served as Senior Regulatory Counsel for BellSouth Corporation in Washington, D.C. where he provided representation before the Federal Communications Commission, Congress and the White House on issues concerning 1996

Telecommunications Act, deregulation of broadband services and tax issues concerning the telecommunications industry. Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G).

Technology, Current Contracts Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently Qualcomm. From a press release: ""Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar’s Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia’s global reach and Globalstar’s Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions."" This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market. GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)

Future Growth With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations!
