11,m1blt3,"I'm sure this will be get down-voted to hell, but here it goes ..

Here on /r/wsb, there is a fair amount of bearish sentiment that retail will be bagholders on GME ultimately, but there seems to be a lot more enthusiasm on it. The trajectory of GME's ascent this time feels different from the previous time, little volume on most days, less volatility than before, a much lower interest rate on borrowing to short.

Apart from the possibility that a) the HFs have given up, or b) the shorts have already been squeezed (mostly) and retail is actually just bidding up the stock against themselves while thinking that the HFs are on the other side (fairly large daily volume makes that less likely, but you never know), what are some opinions on here about what the hedge-funds are up to? If they are still exposed to risk, they seem to be playing it differently this time. They have a lot of really smart people working for them, and a lot of capital, so even accepting that they are greedy and fallible, they must have a plan for how to try to extricate themselves from this situation with as little a loss as possible.

30,m1bokv,"My fellow autists, degenerates, gambling addicts, and of course, my dear retards: It is I - u/pltr_gang_rise_up and I am here to share with you a true post in the spirits of WallStreetBets and would like to put on your radar - SOXL. 

**Backstory:**

**Semiconductors,** as most are aware, are in short supply. There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future. 

**What is SOXL?**

**SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc). 

Be careful, this is a ""Leveraged"" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well. 

**Breakdown:**

Now, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**

When looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.

**What they own:**

Here is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:

Dreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs	11.00%

Financial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares	9.39%

Broadcom Inc.	5.22%

Qualcomm Inc.	4.96%

Intel Corp.	4.94%

Texas Instruments Inc.	4.88%

NVIDIA 	4.67%

Micron Technology Inc.	2.81%

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR	TSM	2.69%

Analog Devices Inc.	2.54%

Applied Materials Inc.	2.51%

Lam Research Corp.	2.50%

KLA Corp.	2.41%

NXP Semiconductors N.V.	2.40%

Advanced Micro Devices Inc.	2.37%

ASML Holding N.V.	2.22%

Microchip Technology Inc.	2.16%

Xilinx Inc.	2.01%	

Marvell Technology Group Ltd.	1.92%

Skyworks Solutions Inc.	1.53%

Teradyne Inc.	1.20%

Qorvo Inc.	1.14%

Monolithic Power Systems MPWR	0.99%

ON Semiconductor Corp.	0.81%

Entegris Inc.	0.78%

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, I'm not sure what the first two are, but that throws up a potential flag.** These two entities represent nearly 20% of the portfolio owned. It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now. 

**Who owns them?:**

Looks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna. 

**Short Interest:**

Not a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.

**Technicals** (got me excited):

Here we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month. 

The daily was also looking nice:

There is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option. 

My target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside.",SOXL will rock your SOXL,1.0,1615311456,pltr_gang_rise_up
