Obviously he missed out on the GME rocket but I was wondering what you guys think of some of his recent moves filed in a 13f:

Citi Group (Calls)- 14.81% of portfolio

Pzifer (Calls) - 13.83% of portfolio

Kraft-Heinz (Calls) - 9.10% of Portfolio

Also looks like he's invested in privatized correctional and detention facilities (Kamala Harris and Correctional facilities - name a better duo) and some other real estate...

So a lot of the FUD on this sub has pivoted. As many of you have noticed, it has become a lot more subtle. It's no longer aimed at getting you to sell immediately. It's no longer trying to convince you the squeeze is made up. This is good news because they gave up on that. But they haven given up completely. So what's their new hustle?

Basically, they want you to sell early. They want to push the idea that this thing is gonna go down in a matter of hours (or even minutes lol). Then when you see a ""big"" number in your account, you'll be so scared of losing it that you'll panic sell. They may or may not orchestrate a ""fake"" squeeze where the price jumps and quickly comes back down. Any and all of this is to scare you into panic selling too low.

We do have a couple genuine problems though: 

1) We have NO IDEA what the magnitude of this squeeze actually is. They have done a very good job of concealing the truth in this regard. 

2) The other problem is a psychological one... Regular Joes like us aren't used to dealing with large numbers. Hedge fund managers are. So the idea that 1 share could be worth 7 figures is unimaginable to us. It isn't to them, they're used to all those commas. They want to use this advantage against you.

My strategy to mitigate these problems: 

1) My target (to start taking profits) for the actual squeeze is 100k. I'm not selling anything on the way UP, until 100k. If we don't make it to 100k, I will still take my profits after the peak. It's not gonna peak and crash; we will have days to sell. This is not a pump and dump, they have to buy A LOT of shares. It's gonna be slow and painful. Don't believe any FUD that tells you otherwise.

2) Now more importantly, once it hits my target price (100k for me), I start selling. However, I only sell a maximum of HALF my position. I reserve the other half to sell AFTER THE PRICE HAS PEAKED. 

Why would I do that? Because I have NO CLUE where the peak is. I only know after the price has come back down! If the peak is 1 million.... I sell my remaining shares AFTER it comes back down to 700-800k or something. Reserving half of my shares until after the peak ENSURES that I will not make the mistake of selling everything too early. We don't know where the peak will be, but this strategy can guarantee you won't miss it no matter how ridiculously high it is.

I believe this is important... I'm taking cues from the shills. The new FUD is to get you to sell early, so that's what I think we need to worry about. Selling half on the way up, and half on the way down is a powerful strategy in our position. It allows you to pick a target to start taking profits on the way up, but it also guarantees you won't grossly misjudge the peak and sell yourself short (no pun intended). The counter FUD will try to convince you that that there will be an immediate crash after the peak. This is total nonsense, and is not the way any short squeezes have gone down. 

TLDR: Timing the peak is not possible given the information we have. Reserving a portion of your shares to sell on the back side of the peak is gonna be the best strategy here, given that the magnitude is unknown and the squeeze will last for days.

To make it short, the problem was that real rates were flying up due to improved economic circumstances and FED was seemingly welcome it. 

A few days have passed and central banks all around the world have made it clear that it was in fact, NOT WELCOME. 

Most importantly, our own FED members finally changed their tune namely with Dally here just near the close : 

&gt;Fed's Daly On If Monetary Policy Become Less Accommodative Than Appropriate:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Could Address With Tools Like Changing Maturity Of Bond Purchases  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Sees QE, Operation Twist As A 'First Tool'   
&gt;  
&gt;**- Not Discounting Use Of Yield Curve Control**

In bold this is really all we needed to hear to make me go from full gay bear to super bull. 

We have JPow Thursday who will most likely reiterate the same message Thursday 1205 pm, but given Dally's and Brainard's interventions tonight there really isn't much left to hear. Market will probably not wait for Powel. 

Real rates are already moving down showing -0.8% 10 year tips at time of writing. 

Don't wanna loose you smooth brain apes but what the fed will achieve here is further lowering the equity risk premia thus allowing NQ to keep its higher valuation despite the higher nominal rates .. for longer.

96,lwe4h5,I’ve seen a lot of posts about how AMC is a distraction from GME but both have a potential for a big squeeze. I’ve also seen people saying posts about AMC being deleted. Facts are GME is too expensive for most people to get in. I personally only have 3. But AMC numbers look so much better. Watch Trey Trades. AMC IS NOT A DEAD CAT. This is not financial advice. I just like AMC stock,AMC IS NOT A DISTRACTION,1.0,1614723599,jballou1997
