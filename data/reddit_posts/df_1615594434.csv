2,m3uvyp,"Its that the American economy is fucked. Millions of people are literally gambling their money away, why? Because this may be the only chance they get. This may be their only opportunity to escape poverty, stupid amounts of debt, medical bills, and just maybe have enough left to have fun with. Inflation has never kept in line with minimum wage, you used to be able to buy a house or pay for college solely on minimum wage. Most of us have always been told to ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" to get ahead. Well, my boots are on grandpa. 

These people have been deemed the ""bad guys"" in the GME saga. You and me. 

Now, I don't know about you, but in no way, shape, or form do I believe that I'm the bad guy in this scenario. I'm trying to $cum from behind. I'm trying to be able to live comfortably for once. I'm not looking to retire or make millions off of this. What I do want is to be released from, at some times overwhelming, debt. I want my kids to have a better childhood than I did. I want to be able to send them to college, and be able to help them later in life. I've found an opportunity to be able to do that finally. 

If this whole thing doesn't scream ""fix the fucking economy"" then i don't know what will.

This is not a quick sell in my head but could be seen differently, I am asking our people to buy on dips on the ask price or 2-4 cents higher to keep a steady climb and hold until we reach 20$ or up, this is the price I am aiming for but if we can get higher I am all for it, I just need to know if we have our army of apes helping us out. we closed this Friday  at decent price and are looking to drive it up more next week.

In all seriousness. Lets hear the bull and bear case for GME and what is actually required to make this go up. There's a bunch of people saying how options expire day X =🦍go🌕 but it's not as simple as that. I'm also worried about what happens if GME actually goes past $350 and $400.

43,m3v56t,"Ok fellow apes! We all love hated stonks of well known companies. Therefore I’d like to bring attention to never-loved GPRO. This is a household name just like GME &amp; AMC, shares have been beaten down to hell basically since IPO. This godforsaken stonk has barely seen double digits through most of its lifetime. That being said, everyone knows this brand. It was ahead of it’s time, but only for a very short time, when it came to camera quality and capabilities. As smartphones got better and better it started to deteriorate their sales as more could simply use their IFIN and Samscumb phone.

That brings us to the present. They are pivoting to a subscription model which has grown from new to 760,000 paid subscribers in approximately one years time since they pivoted their focus. This shit ass company’s market cap is only around 1.6B even after its present rally from $7 to around $11. Its short float is nothing great-approx 11% if this Google didn’t lie to this dumb retard, but that’s plenty to build on. This small cap target is the perfect candidate to diamond hand the hell out of and make a run towards Ape Heaven. GoPro has learned from their mistakes and focused on cutting costs while staying afloat. Now that we are REOPENING, this could end up being the perfect play as people begin to travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do that this ape wouldn’t touch. Per their last CC, they took a big hit with stores and travel being mostly closed as this product sells best in person. 

What day you apes!? Do you what to make a run at one of WallStreets most hated stonks of all time?! Is it time for this shitshow of a company to bloom? I don’t know shit about shit, but if we all agree on something then let it be so.

Here’s the play $KODK. As of March 12, 2021 it’s current market cap is 753.9M 9.77/share. Couple points on why I think it’s worthy for some tendies. 


Billionaire Tom Golisano, founder of payroll processing company Paychex (worth $34B) committed to invest $100 million with his fund Grand Oaks Capital. With this acquisition he had to file a schedule 13D since his ownership is 8.74%. Golisano will likely get a board seat, in paying close attention when billionaires build activism positions they see value in a company like our lord Ryan Cohen did for $GME

Tom is from Rochester and Kodak company is HQ in Rochester. If a billionaire puts in that much capital he must see something that I don’t think anyone sees. I wonder why... 

Initial thought on Kodak would be disposable camera business which tend to be a thing of the past. But not true at all there’s still a lot of commercial quality things that need to be printed. Here’s what Bloomberg has as a description for it “Eastman Kodak Company develops, manufactures, and markets imaging products for businesses. The Company provides disruptive technologies and imaging solutions in the product goods packaging, functional, and digital printing markets. Eastman Kodak also offers products and services in entertainment imaging and commercial films. “

This is pure speculation on Kodak.... but it would make sense for Kodak to get involved in the NFT (Non Fungible Tokens) space. The applications on that I could write an entire thread on it but I’m sure you remember Kodak converting to a technology company back in 2017. They were too early then but now look at some real examples of this technology happening around us. Top shot NBA did 230M in sales in February. In the music industry artist are selling NFT albums to there fans and selling out immediately like the CD era. This space will only grow and it makes sense for Kodak to jump into this. 

Another point this past summer in July. Kodak was awarded 765M to start producing generic pharmaceutical drug but went through some issues as the price went up from nearly 1.50 - 60.00, Of course the ex-president trump was involved but this was going to be a big change in direction for Kodak. Bringing American jobs for medicine which will be a growing industry as boomers get older. The current CEO Jim Continenza says  “the move would create at least 350 new jobs, launching a new business unit for Kodak that — when at peak production in four to five years — could produce 25% of the active ingredients for  ""non-biologic, non-antibacterial, generic pharmaceuticals."" Now that loan is still pending but im pretty sure Biden will be all for bringing US jobs back and also the need for the US to start building for the demand of drugs that will only continue to go up as boomers get older / sicker.

As you can see there’s a couple points that led me to investing in Kodak. We will see what happens after earnings come out this coming Tuesday. I will hopefully continue this thread. This is a long term play but I can see this as a turn around company like GME with the right management and decisions, there is plenty of upside. Also the technical analysis on the chart looks amazing for a move up.

83,m3vej2,"&gt;TL;DR Everyone needs to calm down about daily prices, gains and volumes... and just hold. Remove your stop loss, set notifications for the upticks and let it go. Really. That's it. If you're holding gamestop stock long, you will come out on top *eventually*. But, please read and share your thoughts. I'm going to bed and I absolutely will reply to most people come the morning.

So, I've been following GME for a while now and ...

I think people need to be more confident. Not the ""100k isn't a meme"" kind of confident. But the calm kind. The rational kind. The kind which can empathise with everyone on all sides of this trade.

**People who currently have short positions have no exit strategy.**

What does that mean? It means if you go long on GME and they succeed in their transformation... you **cannot lose**. GME could literally be a ""buy and go afk for 6 months and return a millionaire,"" situation. 

There is a single loss condition, and that is the total collapse of the dollar. Pray that JP manages to keep pumping the eco before that happens...

There have been targeted disinformation and misinformation campaigns, I've personally reported multiple accounts who are spreading easily disprovable lies under bullshitting. I think it's an important time to remember Kramer's video. If you haven't watched it. Find it. It is *eye opening*.

You have to remind yourself that there is currently a battle between institutions on betting whether either long, or short, is the more profitable position for GME. And that in a war of attrition... shorts **cannot win if people hold their shares in a profitable company.** Look at Tesla. Millionaires were made by Tesla, and that wasn't even as heavily shorted as GME is...

This event isn't something anybody should try and pin a date for. **We all know one thing, shorts r fuk.** So we don't need a date. We need a trigger.

This is the confidence you need and the confidence we are missing. Say it to yourself. Literally think about what they can do if Gamestop succeeds? Shorts. R. Fuk.

&gt;This isn't delusion. It is absolutely rational analysis of the situation we are in.

I think the likelihood of Gamestop failing in its mission to transform into an e-commerce focused company is quite low. So low that, if you aren't already in on GME, it is **absolutely worth** even just a fractional share of GME even at its current price.

So what can shorts do against a company that is more-than *likely* bound for success?

**Hope that people sell their shares**.

That's it.

The **only** **thing** **retail** **can** **do** in this fight to help institutional longs is **tighten the float.** As much of it as possible. I think what long whales are *actually waiting for is retail to do this.* And retail *isn't*, because it's bruised, sore and a bit hurt by GME's volatility. We also have too many people day trading and flipping for a quick 5%.

&gt;So... forgive me for swearing... I don't think this is a YOLO and print in a week situation. I think we have to...  *invest.*

And this makes so much sense why DFV hasn't sold. He literally told us, we thought he was just joking. But he told us what to do. ""What's an exit strategy?"" We have to go long too. Once enough of us realise this and do it, **that's the signal for whales to pop the rocket.**

A lot of people on wsb are already calling it boring, saying that trading sideways is dull and where is the squeeze already. But, there's too much free float to attempt a squeeze. Think about it. Long whales will drop their capital to push the price and shorts just open new shorts and... essentially beat the longs. Longs lose their value along the way and shorts gain capital they can use to survive longer. This is what we actually saw on Wednesday I think.

That's why we aren't seeing any whales jumping on. Whoever made that upward movement on Wednesday was premature and didn't understand the retail culture. In fact, it is highly possible that it was coordinated by the shorters.

Retail scares **easily**, because often it compromises of emotional investors who don't do research and don't think rationally. They see money go up or down and praise or panic. That's why we had a SLOW and STEADY run up the entire time before Wednesday. Our ally whales were trying to **build confidence in the retail trader** that GME is worth **holding onto**. There is psychology on both sides.

Retail needs to have composure and **not use the most scammy fucking feature of a broker: the stop loss.** In absolutely no circumstances for GME would you **ever** want to use a stop loss. It is a long play. You NEVER use a stop loss in a long play.

**You use the buy limit. You create buy walls.** This creates consistent upward pressure that cannot be plowed through by any number of short attacks. And here's the thing... **if they try to, they increase the number of shares they have to buy back from us**.

Stop losses essentially give leverage to short positions by giving them free downward pressure. **If people didn't trigger stop losses on Wednesday, we would have possibly seen the squeeze begin on this Friday. Today.**

Do. Not. Use. Stop. Losses. For. Any. Trade. You're. Going. Long. On. Not just GME. Any stock.

The available float for GME **needs to be 90% restricted, or more, to even attempt a squeeze.** That means no more than 5m shares available at any given time. That was the real **trigger** behind VW. The free float.

Retail is actually bigger than institutions, in terms of available capital. It is absolutely possible that retail can tie that float up **in a single day**. Once the institutional longs can measure that the float is tight, by seeing how volatile the stock becomes when they test it, they can move.

People are asking for whales to step in, but whales cannot ask anyone anything. Whales can't directly tell us what to do. They risk being prosecuted, shut down or imprisoned. They have to work secretly and have to try and build confidence in the value of the stock by slowly pumping it. Retail needs to regain its confidence and superiority in this situation.

**Our whales need retail. Not the other way around.**

I'm not telling anyone to buy. I'm not a financial advisor. But for goodness sake... there is **no downside to going long on a company that is highly likely successful in the future**, besides the low risk of it failing in that endeavour.

Yes yes, ""it can't go tits up."" But really? What can go wrong with Gamestop? A team of e-commerce business veterans fail to push a cash positive company with high brand recognition in the largest entertain market sector into an e-commerce giant?

Have. Confidence.

&gt;If you're long GME. You're going to print money. 

The minute that long whales see that retail has tied up the majority of the float and refuses to let go... **we get our squeeze.**

This is **exactly** what Mark Cuban told us.

Remember and trust in your purchase. People who bought GME at 500 and won't sell, will very likely see more profits than people who bought at 20 and sold at 40.

Institutions who are short Gamestop already have accrued $7,000,000,000 of *unrealised* losses. They haven't lost that capital yet. They haven't closed their short positions. They will do anything they can to reduce that unrealised loss. But if Gamestop succeeds, they can't reduce that loss to 0. 

If retail gets behind Gamestop, that loss can only **grow, until they cannot justify it anymore and close their positions.**

In summary:

Believe in what the company will do. Understand the shorts can only *delay* or hope that a ""natural disaster"" happens. Remember that the float needs to be restricted for a squeeze to actually happen. 90% or more. Understand that our ally long whales are relying on retail, not the other way around. And refuse to use a stop loss when you're going long. Do the risk:reward in your head. Don't be emotional. Don't over-extend with your investment so you become emotional. Invest what you can and hold it. Like GME or not, this is history in the making. Make sure you're on the right side of it.

86,m3vfn0,"Deutschebank conducted a massive poll of 18-45 year old men. 60 percent took their stimulus money and invested in stocks. A good portion of those invested high risk high reward stock such as GME and AMC. I believe this is about to happen again. As in ALL next week! 

AMC will absolutely be a recipient of a huge bump next week. Not a good week ahead  if your a golden spoon hedgie with daddy’s credit card and a gal that wants the card not you.  If you bet against AMC you are going to be very sorry over the next few months. Stimulus will bump up the stock all next week. 

Then DTCC will happen within 45 days. When that happens the Hedgies are Fckd the ball game will change a lot, house advantage will slightly go away. Bottom line Hedgies can get a margin call on their borrowed daddy banks money. Daddy bank is scared shitless to lose more money from amc and Gme trades. 

Bottom line of today’s post... AMC will increase the next two weeks from the stimulus bump. After that to the moon once DTCC and summer movies hit.

96,m3vhmg,"Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.

Not financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.

This will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.

I mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.

Rule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?

The rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.

The list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).

Side note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.

Onto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? 

Unless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.

*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*

I know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?

The thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.

Fortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.

Oh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**

Put simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. 

It also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.

*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*

For instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. 

The rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. 

What I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. 

You'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.

Let's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. 

Pulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.

The rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.

TLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.",Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME,1.0,1615596543,Leaglese
