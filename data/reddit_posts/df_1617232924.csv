2,mhiefm,"**Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA)** is an advanced biotechnology company developing medical treatments with the use of **CRISPR**. 

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.**

61727054 Says Ken is Next

I know that you know what that number relates to Ken. I know that you have a plaque in your NY office with that on it. Actually..It’s known that London, Chicago, New York all have 61727-054 cleverly placed and/or referred to. 

61727-054 *bold move*

For the longest time you’ve done everything possible to exceed where they failed. For years now you’ve shared your goals and your ambitions when it comes to Citadel. To be the biggest you’ve gotta slay the legend. You’ve never shied away from letting those around you know what your aim is..what really fuels you everyday, every account, every trade. To be the king of Wall St. Bigger and scarier than the Wolf. A legend. A myth. 

...A genius. Just like xXx did it but better. They got tired and worn out. You’ve always considered that their weakness. They were only able to keep it going for so long, you’ve always felt as though you could get away with it forever. 

I must admit..you’ve been clever. You’ve taken what you learned and have adapted quite well. That was until you allowed two mistakes to be made.

I didn’t catch it before in 2019 when I started to peek behind the curtains and peel back the layers. But I have now and day by day so do others. Just like you...plain sight. 

The more I think about it and the more research that I do into the books, I can’t believe that NO ONE outside a handful of others have recognized the patterns. But that’s okay..because 🦍’s are getting ever so closeclose. So many 🦍’s are on the path, they just haven’t stumbled upon the right trees and bushes. Yet. 

{Insert Rozay} *I remember being blind to it
Til the day I put my mind to it*

Funny how alumni networks have become so clutch over the past year(Fuck Covid, amirite?)..Without them how would some dumb ape be able to gain access to the Citadel Securities Department of Computer Science at a certain uni..😳🤭🤫

14,mhilup,"Just got off work at Wendy's, smoked a bowl, and now I am chilling here vibing to the thought of GME and the non-institutional sentiment around it currently. I own 20 shares at $220 avg. that I have accumulated since January 28th and me and my **Diamond Dickbeaters** are not going anywhere. (did not average down at forty, but averaged up on second moon mission because I am retarded)

At the Wendy's I work at, I know alot of the other burger flippers that did not get in GME the first or second time the price mooned. Now they're constantly telling me, though I do not give a fuck, ""man if it hits below $XXX.XX again I am definitely going to get some shares this time"". In my head I think *you would just paperhand the shit anyways.* However, I know that if it dips like that again this entire subreddit will flood the fucking gates. FOMO will re-engage and the ""third times a charm"" Burger Flippers will pile in as well. This sort of goes with what Cuban said about the lower it goes the more dangerous retail and WSB becomes. The way I see it, it wont create less Diamond Hands, but more. 

Day by day, GME prevails against wild market conditions and my smoothbrain flirts with my diamond dickbeaters to keep SLAPPING THAT ASK! 

Every blatant ladder attack since the beginning of March GME recovered from the BTFD crew, and new domestic or Europoor autists turning into Apes by yoloing crazy amounts. 

So I ask, how much longer until GME's price is not looked at as artificial by the institutions only held up by the thought of a short squeeze? I know the possibility is there, but even without it I do not feel that retarded thinking I have a good position. I have conviction in this play.   


I look at TSLA and think back to all the FUD it got and short selling pressure, but it just kept going. 

I am not trying to compare GME to TSLA, but at some point institutions have to realize it is not just an impending squeeze keeping the stock ""overvalued"". It is the fact we WE LIKE THE STOCK and Diamond Hands or Dickbeaters

Not Financial Advice, I am stoned writing this, make your own thoughts and decisions.

He brought to the streamers attention during his live, that the call options for $12 shot up to $22mil in that hour, or something like that today. Not to mention somewhere around a total $50mil under $20 call strike. 

I don't have optionsonar so I can't link the page for verification. But shmandrew and ball of meat showed the data on the screen. Assuming that it is true, people are speculating that it is hedgie tactics. 

What no one has speculated yet though is, what if the point of the specificity of the $12 call strike was to congest that call option strike so that u/DeepFuckingValue , and any ape holding $12 calls, can't sell efficiently if they wanted? Now that such a mass amount were bought today, what does that mean for DFV's, and other apes, options? Does this force their hand, to exercise? With so many $12 calls so deep in the money what comes of this play to buy so many today?

&amp;#x200B;

[LETS GOOOOOOOO](https://preview.redd.it/tvrcw6oc8gq61.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff81522e9f4848194c1894f9aee7de723d5a46ce)

However you absolute buffoons have been purchasing Canadian stocks for the coming of American legalization, IE: APHA, SNDL (which is cool for short term I guess) because you're purchasing in hopes other idiots will make the same mistake, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the real value that comes with American legalization, and that’s American companies adapting. 

Altria is an american tobacco company that's been genuinely thriving, and purchased a couple of patents for cannabis in the off chance it ever did get legalized. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Ok but how does that differ than most other cannabis or pre-established cannabis stocks” you might ask, drool dripping down your double chin, to which I reply-

GOOD QUESTION, when I say this stock is thriving, I mean it’s t h r i v i n g, coming out of an insane dip from 2017-early 2020, MO just got moved to the investors “BUY” list and had its fair value increased to 58$ last week just off of its tobacco business alone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zlzd13zo8gq61.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38a62afa129da40c28004a088db8f1312e5452b

&amp;#x200B;

 But I havent even fucking mentioned the dividends  W O O  L A D 

Every couple of months the stockholders of MO get back 0.86 on each share in dividends which is basically just free fucking money for not pulling out, and you best believe that before every dividend payoff date you can see a considerable spike in the price of the stock, only for it to retain that price (falling slightly after payoff, if any).

AND IT GETS EVEN WACKIER

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wrbeuml8gq61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9c614b1c2534249d615a30b529e33492bfc979c

They’ve been raising their dividend price every fucking year for the past 51 years.

Anyways, to conclude, this stock has an assload going for it even without the weed, but you best bet that once weed gets introduced into the mix this April, this thing’s going to explode. This is one of my longs

(Positions: 300 shares, 51 contracts expiring September)

My best advice would be to hop in now while the price is low(er).

The hackers gained account admin access to their entire AWS infrastructure, which gave them access to user databases, secret keys, logs, the works.  


I feel like they are just taking a slap on the wrist, and their malfeasance will go unpunished.

Caught in a short squeeze,  
No escape from reality  
Open your terminals,  
Look up to the charts and see,  
I'm just a poor hedge, I need no sympathy,  
Because I'm easy call, easy put,  
Little high, little low,  
Any way the price goes doesn't really matter to  
Me, to me

Mamaaa,  
Just killed a short,  
Put a share against his bet, held the share,  
Now he's dead  
Mamaaa, squeeze had just begun,  
But now I've gone and yolo'd it all away  
Mama, oooh,  
Didn't mean to make you cry,  
If I'm not buying again this time tomorrow,  
Hold it on, hold it on as if nothing really matters

Too late, the squeeze has come,  
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all  
The time  
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to cover,  
Gotta leave wall street behind and face the truth  
Mama, oooh  
I don't want to cover,  
I sometimes wish I'd never been short at all.

I see a little silhouetto of an ape,  
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you cover your position!

Regulations and margin, very, very frightening me

74,mhj7ld,"This is true the market could crash from this squeeze if it’s huge enough. With the DTCC ruling of other hedge funds having to pay up it could cause massive sell off and liquidation in stocks across the market if they go under. (Credit Suisse for example) This is scary considering banks could become exposed, but the transfer of wealth to the retail investor would x50. While hedge funds and the stock market is rocked we could reinvest on the Black Friday of stocks giving more power to retail investors and possibly creating a more fair market because of it. Just a thought, scary times ahead if this squeeze reaches 10,000+. In a way I feel bad if we crash the market but we are not to blame for the flawed system that the government didn’t take control over and ignored the illegal practices and malicious intents of these hedge funds in the first place. It would have happened either way, might as well get some working class people a fat paycheck and some respect if it’s gunna go down.

93,mhjgpb,"I know I’ll probably catch a lot of flack for this but I have good feelings about Razer in the next 3 years. Honestly I’m too new to the market for any real TA but considering what I allow myself to gamble without risking going broke, it’s a safe play with huge upside potential and minimal risk. 

When I started last year with about $1000, the only way to motivate myself without causing any stress from my lack of knowledge was to be a value and thematic investor. I couldn’t afford huge gambles but I did seize what I felt were good opportunities like with NIO when it was at $2. I loved their battery swapping concept which Tesla tried and failed at and really believed in the company. It served me well and although it’s chump change to most of you, I made about $5,000. The more I read into companies, the more excited I was to learn more about the market. 

I found WSB and I have to honestly say, I am very inspired by a lot of you and probably learned more valuable information here than anywhere else in life so for that, thank you from the bottom of my heart. 

Of course I can’t go without mentioning DFV. When reading his earlier posts, I felt the passion and hope he had for GME despite catching flack. I can’t argue my passion for Razer is built on any analysis like DFV had, but I remember a time when Razer offered the premium gaming products. 

The general consensus now is that their products are shit but just look cool but if you take a look at the reviews for their headsets and other components, they are still highly rated and at competitive prices. I also believe with GME broadening their e-commerce and increasing in popularity, that Razer will be riding the wave as well. 

They had 1.2b in sales during the pandemic I and although it’s going to be gimmicky at best, I feel their upcoming RGB mask is going to be a hit. 

I also see Razer positioning themselves deep within the eSports market. This has already begun and the CEO is very forward-thinking with adapting to other current trends.
