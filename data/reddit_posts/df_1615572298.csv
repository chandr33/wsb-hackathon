NOW LISTEN UP RETARDS THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE IM JUST AN APE AND I REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK, LET ME EXPLAIN WHY IF YOU WOULD RATHER SKIP THE BORING STUFF JUST SCROLL DOWN FOR APE VERSION. 

VISN/BNVIF is super undervalued, the company is planning to release an app in this first quarter of 2021 the last time binovi released an app was on May 1st 2020 by May 27th that same year, they doubled the stock price. This company has recently been heavily shorted causing the stock to plummet, the stock has been in a down trend for years and used to be worth 18 dollars a share, this stock could easily be jacked up if the right people noticed ESPECIALLY with them expanding into European markets. Binovi Technologies Corp is a true turnaround story in the works and this app release could be a major catalyst for them. Binovi has increased its revenues by 100% in the last quarter however they are still not profitable. the app being released is geared towards Telehealth specifically in vision care and enhancement. There has been no new, news on this stock in over a month which makes me thing they are really ramping up to get this app ready for the public. Congrats if you made it this far here is the APE version

52,m3nkl5,"Lordstown Motors, ticker RIDE US exchange Nasdaq, is subject to a short report by Hindenburg Research, who has a historical 40% win rate. They allege the company of fraudulent non-binding pre-orders, even though they have always been listed as such by the company. They target former disgruntled employees who provide critical comments about the CEO.

[https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/)

If the whole company is fake, with tons of employees at the Lordstown plant, why hasn't the CEO sold any shares at all, while still owning 28% of the company? So, he's just making it all up and hurting his own net worth in the process? The CEO, Steve Burns, has a majority of his own net worth in Lordstown, and according to Hindenburg ""Research"", has made everything up and is going to destroy his own net worth. Right, right.

Take a look at previous fraudulent companies, such as nikola motors and others prior to the EV boom. They have always had the CEO, the main culprit, selling shares rapidly prior to and inducing a collapse. That is not the case here where the CEO has not sold any shares yet, unlike Trevor Milton, who sold millions early on.

100,000 pre-orders, 3rd largest plant in the US at 6.2 million square feet, credits given on orders so the trucks are only $45,000 USD discounted down from $52,500.

Here’s some ape logic that a lot of you crayon eaters may be able understand

Say you’re having the best intercourse of your life. Your partner is the hedge funds. If this is going to be the best fuck of your life are you going to pull out early? Girls are you going to let them finish fast? No, you’re going to fuck the shit out of them because once this is over you’ll never have the “best intercourse” of your life again. Finishing early means there was still a lot left to be done &amp; if you finish early someone else is going to come take your place &amp; fuck them better.

Builders FirstSource manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers, and consumers in the United States. Basically they build to order construction elements like roof trusses, dormers, and cabinets to make the framing of a building much simpler, cheaper, and faster than if a builder was buying the lumber, looking and plans and doing all the framing themselves. 

I like this stock and have been adding over the last 18 months.  It has a 5.5b market cap so within the thresholds of this forum. Why it is not a meme yet I do not know. The thing moves like NAIL with a beta of 2.58 while being wholly less likely to go up in smoke. 2020 was a huge year for them, the stock gained 146% yet still trades at just 17.75 P/E. It is currently trading near ATH making it both undervalued and a growth opportunity. 

Honestly, I don’t know much about technical analysis so I’m just going to quote their CEO regarding Q4: “Revenue increased 3.6%, adjusted operating profit grew 22.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6%. Adjusted operating and EBITDA margins expanded 200 basis points and 240 basis points respectively, and adjusted net income increased 32.6% to $7.28 per diluted share.” 

The stock is only around $47 a share with 206.5 million shares. There is currently unprecedented demand for residential new construction but all their sectors grew last year, including commercial construction.  Their earnings per share growth for Q4 2020 grew 237% over the same quarter of the prior year.

Cons: Volume is low, no one seems to know about it. Bid ask spreads fairly wide. Lumber prices are extremely high right now due to idiots who hoarded toilet paper and forest fires in the Northwest USA last year, I believe they can just pass this on to customers but could affect existing contacts. Related to beta, sometimes this can move a lot without an obvious catalyst (good IMO). It doesn’t get much coverage.

Daré just recently announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of a one-time treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The treatment, DARE-BV1, received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and, based on the topline results of the trial, Daré said it planned to file a new drug application in the first half of 2021. This has further attracted analysts and larger investors to keep their eyes on Daré in the upcoming months as it could be used massively later in 2021.

The condition affects approximately 21 million women in the United States, usually in their reproductive years, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279). The condition, which generally doesn’t cause complications, can, however, lead to preterm birth or increase the risk of infertility due to infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes.

***Ovaprene*** **(CURRENTLY OBSERVING DATA FROM PHASE 3)**

Ovaprene is a hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive designed to provide contraception over multiple weeks by releasing a locally acting agent which impedes sperm motility, coupled with a unique knitted polymer barrier that physically blocks sperm from entering the cervical canal. The novel combination of these complementary approaches has the potential to produce efficacy consistent with existing short-acting hormone birth control options (pills, patches, vaginal ring), without the use of hormones.

In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.

**NOTES FOR THIS ONE:**

THIS PRODUCT IS HUGE IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I cannot express how many women struggle due to contraceptives altering their hormones. Birth control medications ranging from pills to IUDS alter women's hormones causing a laundry list of issues such as weight gain, health complications, and mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc.). If this product is successful, it will be the FIRST in women's contraception to create a product like this that can be administered monthly for women. There is only one other product that really exists that women can use for hormone-free contraception, and that is a specific type of an IUD. HOWEVER, IUDs are EXTREMELY painful, and I am sure many women will prefer Ovaprene as it is additionally self-administered.

***SILDENAFIL CREAM*** **(CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2b CLINICAL TRIALS)**

Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the inability to reach or maintain a sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation. An estimated 16% of women ages 21 to 60, or approximately 10 million women in the U.S., are distressed from experiencing symptoms of low or no sexual arousal and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. To put the market opportunity for an FDA-approved FSAD treatment in context, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction (ED) in men is estimated to be about 5% of men at age 40, increasing to about 15% at age 70.

Still, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for FSAD. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Given the underlying pathophysiologic similarities of ED and FSAD, using sildenafil to direct blood to the genitals before sexual activity could provide a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience for women as it does in men.

Our localized, proprietary formulation of sildenafil cream, 3.6% (topical cream, sildenafil), has been designed specifically for women. The targeted application of this cream to the genital tissue is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response.

***DARE-BV1*** **(SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 3 TRIALS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS)**

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. In the U.S. alone, bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women. While there are several orally and vaginally delivered therapeutic interventions indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, currently approved options in the U.S. have relatively insufficient clinical cure rates, require sequential daily administrations or can be otherwise inconvenient for women to use.

DARE-BV1 is a thermosetting vaginal gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized release of the antibiotic.

**Upcoming Products:**

I'm going to be quite honest here, there are a TON of diverse products that this company is currently working on to counter sexual disorders and health complications involving sexual activity. They are additionally looking into contraceptives for Males as well. This company currently has many of these products in the pre-trials stage, but they are committed to continuing research for the benefit of people's health.

**Previous Drop in Price:**

One thing I think many people will look at and question is the 5-year chart for Daré; this stock used to trade at $33/share back in 2017. However, after the acquisition of another company known as Cerulean, Daré conducted a 10 to 1 reverse split which I think additionally scared off investors. Not to mention, COVID additionally further spiked the price down along with other stocks in 2020 as well.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. On March 25th, Dare will announce their Q4 earnings (pre-market). Based on their positive phrase 3 clinical results, this is predicted to be a positive earnings call with further products hopefully entering phase 3 trials soon.
2. Dare is further participating in two upcoming conferences to debut their products to large investors.

&amp;#x200B;

* Conference #1: **33rd Annual Roth Conference (March 15th)** \[This is the same conference that companies like *Assertio* will be presenting at.\]
* Conference #2: **M Vest and Maxim Group Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference (March 17 &amp; 18)**
* Conference #3: **BIO-Europe Spring Digital (March 22 - 25)**

1. **Results for clinical trials on Ovaprene.**

&amp;#x200B;

* \*\*Ovaprene is currently in the process to enter clinical trials which are already looking successful. The following is quoted from the DARE website: ""\*\*In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.""

Something to pull away from this is that they are spreading awareness continuously during this month about their successful trials and upcoming products. Partners and investors are their major concern at the moment, and this is a great opportunity for them to pull in potential partners/investors based on previous successes.

**My Take**

Obviously I recommend you all do your own DD, but this company has the potential to blow up over the course of 2021 with its price target being moved to the $5 - 9 range.
