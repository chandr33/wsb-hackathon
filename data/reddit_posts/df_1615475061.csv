**Apple Inc.** [AAPL 1.65%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) shares may have taken a beating in the recent tech sell-off, but an analyst at Wedbush analyst said his conviction in the stock has only increased.

**The Apple Analyst:** Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating and $175 price target for Apple shares, with the bull case price target at $225. Wedbush added the stock to its ""Best Ideas"" list. 

**The Apple Thesis:** After a [stellar December quarter](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/01/19370036/apple-analysts-lift-price-targets-following-jaw-dropper-q1-4-sell-side-takes), when Apple managed to crush iPhone estimates, some cuts in the iPhone forecasts for fiscal year 2021 were discounted by the market, Ives said in a note.

This is reflected in the stock's sell-off over the last month, the analyst said. 

Wedbush's Asia checks are markedly bullish, suggesting over 230 million units for 2021, he said.

The initial build forecast for the iPhone 13 indicates the supercycle will continue into fiscal year 2022, Ives said. 

""Geographically speaking, demand in China looks strong coming out of the Chinese New Year and remains a linchpin to our Apple bull thesis."" 

The analyst also sees continued uptick in ASPs due to a higher mix of the iPhone Pro and Pro Max, with the Mini being significantly scaled down around production/demand globally.

With a [$3-trillion valuation in sight](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/02/19766821/why-apple-will-hit-a-3-trillion-market-cap-by-the-end-of-2021) for Cupertino, the recent sell-off in share creates a golden buying opportunity, according to Wedbush. 

**AAPL Price Action:** Apple shares lost 0.91% in Wednesday's session, closing at $119.98. ",Why Apple's Stock Sell-Off Is A Golden Buying Opportunity $AAPL,1.0,1615475132,folkwoodswest

Let me explain to you real quick why selling will NOT be prevented during our 🚀 to the 🌕. Each and every sale of a stock makes it able to be bought by hedgies to close their shorts.  
You need NOT be afraid that you will be out of the money. Each and every sale that is withheld, effectively raises GME.   Hedgies want to close as soon as possible, as low as possible. They will not risk closing their shorts buying later and thus more expensive stock.  
We are in no fucking hurry to sell them our stock. Time is on our side in making the price rise. All the timing during, we are making the demands.  
Long on GME is the best position to be in now. Relax. Let it do its thing.

Just google “GME” and click on news, you’ll see exactly what I mean.

I literally could not find a single article about GME until after it dropped yesterday, the hedgies probably have all the media companies in their pockets. This whole debacle has really exposed the media for what they are.

Here's the deal apes, for the last 2 years I have been learning the fundamentals and rules to pattern day trading. I did horrible the first couple weeks in the field but this week I made 4 buy entries at specific points in the patterns and based my entry off the pattern rules and succeeded all 4 times. On the last one, the dreaded 4th one, I saw the 10ema and the 200ema kissing each other just before a break out. I disregarded the rules and went for it and I got out on the 4th bar and made $30. 

Those experienced see what I did wrong. But my point is it all clicked. I'm making money off of the patterns and I will continue to be better each passing day.

I'm only working with $130.00. So I was flagged as a PDT and account blocked from day trading until my apology letter tears at their heart and they lift the suspension.

I come to you on my knees, bloodied and teary eyed asking, no, begging for $24,863 so I can have the equity needed to be a PDT.

I'll do anything in return. ANYTHING.

I am a father of 2 and married to a crazy woman who blows my money on 7/11. She will never know of this and she still has no idea I am even making money trading securities.

It's a long shot but even David made a long shot verses the goliath and nailed him str8 in the head. I am asking you to give me that stone so I can sling it str8 into wallstreets head.
