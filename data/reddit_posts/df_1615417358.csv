7,m2bk62,"Hi buddies,
I am thinking about investing in a small canadian cannabis company, specializing on accesories.
Its name is Hight Tide and it is the first canadian company of this sector to deliver a positive adjusted Ebitda, also its revenues have increased almost a 179% from the previous year.
https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/high-tide-reports-2020-financial-results-featuring-a-166-increase-in-revenue-and-record-adjusted-ebitda-of-8-0-million-862190544.html

Its value is still quite small (around 400 canadian dollars) so I think it still has a long way to walk. Futhermore, the board has applicated to list on Nasdaq so, I think that if the company is accepted it will fly high.

Do any of you have experience investing on cannabis companies or have any idea about this stock?

48,m2bplo,"My fellow autists, I introduce to you the next RKT.

If you’ve been following RKT you're probably wondering if it's going to go back to it's high of $47.53. I don't know when that will be, but what I can tell you it's better to get on the next RKT which is BIGC.

BIGC could be the next RKT very soon.

Back in January, Seeking Alpha posted an article stating that BIGC is currently overvalued.  However after reading that article, I'm convinced that all they want to do is accumulate all the shares at a low price.

BIGC is normally touted as one of shopify's main competitors.  This should be reason enough that this stock is massively undervalued. 

Now onto why it's similar to RKT.

RKT and BIGC did their IPO in August of last year.

Both were heavily shorted however it seems the short ratio in BIGC has dropped in half, probably due to shorts fearing it would be the next RKT

Take a look at both of these charts. 

BIGC looks very similar to RKT before the short squeeze.
