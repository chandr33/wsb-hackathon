3,mggil1,"The lovely world of RKT:

Macro trend 1: move from growth/tech to value.
Macro trend 2: cheap money means increased possibility of over-leveraged hedge-fund failure
Macro trend 3: higher interest rates means this is peak profitability for RKT
Retail love 1: Hedgefunds have the movement of this stock dialed in and gave 4 big (+/- 5) and daily small pumps (+/- 1.5) early to mid-day to keep retail interested, but day-trading (notice you want to sell at 26-7?)
Retail love 2: Rocket is profitable and growing company which continues to outperform.
Macro trend 1 and 2 mean hedgefunds who are poorly managed and/or greedy are going to get their hands stuck in the honeypot and need to liquidate their weakest positions (i.e., Archegos). They are likely to liquidate RKT as Retail love 1 means they have no meaningful attachment to the business and Retail love 2 means the company may be a 'best in class' and will be the strongest survivor in Macro trend 1.

It seems that many hedgies are shorting RKT and also over-invested in hypetech

The eternal cycle: Look back on the 4 big-pump RKT days and see what was negatively correlated. It is all hypey growth/tech. Also notice that in the week before, RKT went down and hypetech went up (i.e., last week). This cycle has existed since the first bump on 1/27. The play is to accumulate RKT and short hypetech in the cycle before the big bump. At big pump, cover your short and sell a bit of RKT.

If I am right, the Big Bust will occur sometime soon. I think Macro trend 2 assures it. This will set you up holding shares of a great company with low downside risk (and has gained as the market tanks, but don't hold your breath) and shorting shares of a 3D-printing ARK cloud-space-data-EV-veganmeat-social company in a death-spiral before Chatham can tweet sobbing about why he sold before you did.

The future: When hedgies are gone, we can go into normal price discovery mode and fight over the fair-price of RKT depending on your future orientation (IMO ~35 1 year...~70 in 2)

&amp;#x200B;

**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**

**MORNING 07:00-12:00**

First thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.

https://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd

Next we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.

https://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542

Whoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.

**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**

https://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0

Michael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart

https://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0

Using my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.

2 hours later...

https://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7

look at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.

&amp;#x200B;

**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**

https://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa

For those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his üçÜ chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY

https://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0

Yep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close

https://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf

And like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.

As Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?

**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both** 

Tune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.

With that caveat in place I would like to initiate my predictions with Tesla:

TSLA will continue to move down until it hits a price target of $557 and may go as low as $508. I expect this price floor to be achieved between April 17 and May 12. It will subsequently rebound to a target of $757 and may go as high as $801.  I expect this price ceiling to occur between June 1 and August 11.

&amp;nbsp;

In my spare time, I‚Äôve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I‚Äôve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there‚Äôs anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn‚Äôt that crazy since it could‚Äôve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&amp;nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that this isn‚Äôt a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it‚Äôs not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&amp;nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn‚Äôt find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&amp;nbsp;

**I‚Äôm not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.

I took a quick look at current valuation and liability ratios for High Tide, Supreme, and Sundial to see which one might be a good investment opportunity. Note: This is one aspect of making an investment decisions, there are a number of other factors to look at when conducting DD

Summary

* Valuing companies based on comps is standard practice, and leveraging ratios helps provide a sense of potential investment opportunities.
* I looked at these 3 companies to get a sense of which ones might be over or undervalued, as well as which ones might be a riskier investment from a liability standpoint
* Analysis is below, but keep in mind these ratios only paint part of the picture to help form an investment thesis.

**Definitions** ‚Äì If you know these then skip this part but if not, it is good to have some context in terms of what the ratio mean and what the values indicate.

* **Price to Book**: Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value. P/B ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments. P/B ratios under 1 are typically considered solid investments.
* **Price to Sales**: The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company‚Äôs stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company‚Äôs sales or revenues. A low ratio could imply the stock is undervalued while a ratio that is higher-than-average could indicate that the stock is overvalued.
* **Quick Ratio**: The quick ratio is an indicator of a company‚Äôs short-term liquidity position and measures a company‚Äôs ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The higher the ratio result, the better a company's liquidity and financial health; the lower the ratio, the more likely the company will struggle with paying debts.
* **Current Ratio**: The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It tells investors and analysts how a company can maximize the current assets on its balance sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables. A company with a current ratio less than 1.0 does not, in many cases, have the capital on hand to meet its short-term obligations if they were all due at once.
* **Debt to Equity**: The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company‚Äôs total liabilities by its shareholder equity. These numbers are available on the balance sheet of a company‚Äôs financial statements. Higher leverage ratios tend to indicate a company or stock with higher risk to shareholders.

Summary of Ratios

I summarized the ratios in the table below. Note that these are just a few ratios I looked at ‚Äì the source of data is TradingView.

Valuation Ratios

*Processing img m29q9j6sd6q61...*

**Thoughts**:

* HITI looks overvalued when looking at P/B ratio and FIRE looks to be undervalued in comparison with a P/B under 1
* HITI and FIRE seem to have decent P/S ratios when compared to SNDL, but it would be good to have a Cannabis industry overview to provide boarder relative comps

Liability Ratios

**Thoughts:**

* HITI seems to be riskier from a liability standpoint, as they have a quick ratio and current ratio under 1 and a high debt to equity ratio
* SNDL seems to have essentially no debt and be in a less risky position.

**Final Thoughts**

* These ratios shed some light on the health and relative value of a company but do not necessarily indicate future performance.
* There are times when ratios can be misleading, for instance if HITI is focused on expansion and growth they might have financed it through debt instead of a capital raise through share issuance.
