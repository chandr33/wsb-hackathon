86,m1ef5q,"Hey All - Here are my main thoughts as to why I have such a overwhelming part of my portfolio in AMD.

Feel free to disagree, agree or critique. We are all obviously bullish on AMD but we don't need an echo chamber!

Bullish:
- Zen has been a hit and the road map into Zen 4 looks to keep kicking Intel while it's down.
- Recent offerings from the Radeon group have been increasingly more competitive, even rivaling Nvidia's core business on a fraction of Nvidia's R+D budget.
- Zen 3 continues to show excellence in incorporating Chipley technology. Chiplet technology allows for greater yields at the foundary, product flexibility and lower costs.
- This experience should transfer to Chiplet GPU technology - allowing for the Radeon group to perhaps take a measurable lead on Nvidia for a generation or two while they catch up.
- Epyc Milan looks dynamite and AMD will be able to gain market share in the computer server market. Recent hires in this area will help AMD gain more adoption.
- New chiplet CNDA data center GPU's on the horizon.
- New software stack incoming to compete with Nvidia's DLSS. This upscaling is rumored to provide a 2x performance boost and will be integrated into each games engine. Adoption by game companies is almost guaranteed since both consoles use and are set up to use the same technology.
- Business world views Lisa Su and AMD as ""execution machines"" - Moore's Law is Dead video. Product roadmaps and goals have consistently met and goals beaten expectations.
- Extensive business relationships with Microsoft and Sony.
- Mass OEM adoption seems to be happening in both Laptop and Desktop market.
- Xilinx merger adds massive revenue and capabilities.
- Because Lisa Su.

Bearish:
- Capacity issues at TSMC have restricted profits at times.
- They are competing with 2 monster companies in Intel and Nvidia in their core business areas.
- Semiconductor stocks are volatile by nature.
- Post Pandemic conditions might reduce profit margins.

That being said I'm confident the Bullish thesis is much more powerful than the Bearish one.
