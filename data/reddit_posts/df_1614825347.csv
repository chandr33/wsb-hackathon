22,lxar35," **Completely uneducated theory that's likely to wipe out my portfolio:**

Zillow  becoming a licensed real estate brokerage in all 50 states is going to  cause their stock to tank for the next 2-4 earnings cycles.

**Basic Ass Background:**

Zillow breaks down its income into three distinct segments: Homes, IMT, and Mortgages.

The  homes segment is their ibuyer program where they buy directly from home  sellers and essentially flip the house. Zillow generated $1.37 billion  in 2019 selling 4,313 homes. However, they still lose money on every  transaction.

The IMT Segment  (internet, media, technology) is their core business. This includes the  extra special Premier Agent program, where they charge agents a fee to  be listed on listings they got from agents for free (neat trick!) Their  revenue for this segment is $1.27 billion in FY 2019; most of that  income was from the Premier Agent program ($924 million).

The  mortgage segment is exactly that and generated $100.7 million in FY  2019. I am sure it’s profitable, but still a very small portion of their  overall revenue.

Just a quick note here: The FY 2020 net LOSS was $162 million against $3.4 billion in revenue.

Important Take away: $924 mil of Z’s $2.74b revenue in FY2019 was from Agents paying Zillow.

**Great… buy why the hell would I short a massive tech company in a bull market?**

Zillow,  to continuously grow and take over more of the real estate transaction  decided to become a licensed real estate brokerage in all 50 states over  the last 6-12 months. They basically completed the process about 2  months ago.

Why does that matter?  Well, real estate agents are pissed. A small minority have bitched and  moaned about Z for years. But many spent money with them because the ROI  was good. But that was before they became a DIRECT competitor to all  agents. All I’ve seen for the last 60 days are agents cancellation Z’s  Premier Agent program all over social media.

**But can a few pissed off agents really affect Zillow’s stock price?**

Well  that’s the gamble. Zillow’s only profitable business is selling ad  space to real estate agents. Sure, they make A LOT of revenue in other  ways… but operate those units at a loss. The Premier Agent program is  their golden goose.  Even if 10-15% of existing customers (agents)  cancel their subscriptions... that's a number with more zero's and  comma's than my feeble brain can type.

**Summary (if you are still conscious):**

Zillow  just pissed off an entire business unit that generates 30% or more of  their total revenue and the only profitable business unit they have.  Their next earnings call should reflect this, driving the stock price  lower.

I am YOLO shorting the hell  out of the stock and am up 300% in 24 hours…. I will probably lose it  all because you should not take investment advice from a real estate  guy. (May this also serve as my disclaimer).",Zillow Theory - For all my Put Options YOLO,0.75,1614825784,CummingKitteh
