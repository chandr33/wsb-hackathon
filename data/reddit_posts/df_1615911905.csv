1,m6cxen,"GME DD:
I start a poll to see how much each individual own GME stocks 

500 people participate so far. Guess what I find ???
Around 50,000 share of #GME 

That’s 1/1000 of float 

IF AND ONLY IF this sample is a good sample of population and 500,000 people in WSB OWN the same amount. People on the WSB own  the whole float.

Nobody can be sure until more people participate 

A lot of people tell me that this will help hedge fund😂 
My answer is simple hedge funds already knew how much they shorted but WE DONT 

Nobody give us the real short interest 
Not FINRA, CNBC or the rest of them

49,m6d88f,"As some of you idiots who, like me, are too simple to use a complicated broker to buy tendies on the market might have already read in an email today, eToro, the beloved shit-tier broker with the annoying ads, is planning to go public through a SPAC, trading under the ticker FTCV. (after a rapid increase following this news, currently trading at ~ $14)

Of course I already threw some money in cause why the hell not, but now I’d like to know what my fellow investors think and if I should prepare myself for sadness and regret in the following days. 

My investment decision was based on the fact that the email said they value themselves at 10B, while the market cap of the SPAC is only 300mil. Although I’m sure someone here will explain to me how these numbers are not related at all, I’m still pretty bullish. A ton of people here use it and it’s the closest thing to RH we Europeons have. No options (instead their disfigured little cousin CFDs) but otherwise comparable. Easy interface, asking very little questions.
