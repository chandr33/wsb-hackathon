Sadly, I traded a couple times earlier today and I reached the max before $25k in the app. Because I don’t have 25k to be a day trader, I couldn’t do anything except hope that GME would get better. As you’ve seen, it hasn’t. So I pulled out. I can’t use Robinhood if I’m making risky moves like GME or RBLX. I need an app that won’t limit people in trades per day. I would gladly take a small trade fee any day over limiting its users.",Fuck Robinhood.,1.0,1615405121,DHB_Master

What is the SSR Rule?  The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after.
