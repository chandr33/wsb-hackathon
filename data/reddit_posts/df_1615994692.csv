Basic info:  


Small market cap, 84.51M  
Shares float: 4.88M  
P/E: 16.18  
Insider ownership: 69.69% (lol)  
Sales Q/Q: 	89.30%  


With these characteristics, specially the market cap and float, it won't need a lot of buying pressure for the price to soar. And as for reasons for this:  


**from their last 6K filing:**

28,m731y4,"Hello

I am new here 

wanted to ask your Ideas about one strategy

now VW share goes UP

VW have 2 types of shares regular VOW (ADR in USD  VWAGY) and prefered VOW3 (ADR in USD  VWAPY)

before COVID19  almost all the time both shares where traded in above same price, sometimes one was higher sometimes other.  Because for regular investor this shares are above the same, one can vote, other pays dividends for  0,06 EUR more.

But now price difference between become unreasonably huge, due high interest in Volkswagen shares.

what do you think? If sell short VOW@297 and buy the same amount of shares VOW3@227, and close both deals when interest in Volkswagen share decreases, and shares will cost about the same price. and it doesn't mater will it be on 400EUR or 150EUR, you will get 60-70eur per share anyway.

Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-palantir-ceo-alex-karp/vi-BB19Aen1) where he mentions Apollo:

&gt; We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.

As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:

&gt; deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack. 

And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization: 

&gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

------

#Apollo

So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379). The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:

Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider. 

Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts. 

Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments. 

Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.

As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt. 

Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private. 

**Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly. 

Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.   

----

#Implications

In the Apollo article, it ends with:

&gt;  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:

&gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet. 

This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws. 

Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined. 

Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.

Top of the morning to you fine people! Been looking around for a free service to track the options interest but only found paid ones. So I wrote one and I'm handing it over free-of-charge!

Word of advice, I recommend using google chrome; got some weird caching happening in Firefox. If you keep getting cached versions of the scatter plot, use incognito, that 100% refreshes it.

[https://optionsentiment.live/](https://optionsentiment.live/)

Added the meme stocks to the first page as links for easy navigating, but you can search for any ticker by using the search bar.

Some explanation of what's there;

For example, let's take: [https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme](https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme)

For every ticker, you get a Scatter Plot and a Sankey; Puts are red, calls are green.

Since this is using yahoo finance to get all its numbers from, I had to think of a way to not make a call every time someone wants to look at these. The solution I came up with was to cache each image for 5 mins.

So if the last snapshot was taken less than 5 minutes ago, you get the cached image. If not, you get a brand-spanking new one and it will replace any existing cached images.

I'm not a web developer by trade, so the site itself is pretty basic. But I can improve it if I can get it to a) pay for its own hosting and b) earn some income on the side to merit working on it.
