32,m4ntfj,"Ok, this is outside the normal weird texts and robo calls. This one is seriously weirding me out.

I have an iPhone 8 plus, using AT&amp;T.

The past couple days I've been getting phone calls from several people on my contacts - these are the numbers of people I know personally. On my phone, I see their contact/picture when my phone is ringing, just as if they are really calling me. But when I pick up, I hear weird, muted sex noises, like a couple is banging and their phone is under a pillow. Other times it's just static-y silence.

Yesterday, it was my friend's old number (which was deactivated months ago). After ignoring those, I started getting calls from my sister's number. I cussed them out over the line and started ignoring those as well. Then, just now, I started getting these calls from my girlfriend's number.

Note that my phone still works normally when people are actually calling, or when I'm calling them. So it's not a phone or wireless issue.

I wiped my iPhone today and will be changing my number tomorrow.

So I am cruising thru clubhouse trying to find an official WSB room and I couldn’t find one. I figure that we have a couple of other official similar platforms like discord and Twitter, why not clubhouse?

Maybe this is bad idea because I have mashed potatoes for brains but I think it would be an interesting platform to go to in case of sub maintenance or some sort of shut down by Wall Street. 

Oh, and it’s probably worth mentioning that there is a couple of rooms on there already masquerading as official Wall Street bets rooms and accounts. It’s probably only a matter of time before he who shall not be named opens a room claiming to speak for the sub.

Anyways, if the mods see this I have a couple of invites to send out. If you’re not on already, and you want to make an official WSB room, PM me so I can send my invites.

Upfront disclaimer - I've been lurking here for awhile, decided it was time to join and post. I am not an animal. I am a dad of 2, I quit my job on a commodity trade floor 2 years ago (not a trader) after my son was born, and I recently started a business. I've traded stocks for more than 10 years, haven't ever consistently beat the market. I do not offer any type of financial advice, and never plan to. I'm not a teacher, and believe there are stupid questions. Be an adult and do your own work, don't ask me things you can easily google. All values below from Yahoo Finance.


TL;DR - GME stock still cheap using tech company valuations. Buy it for tendies, don't paper hand bc volatility.


This post contains the F word. I hope that doesn't get it banned, because Fundamentally I see GME undervalued. Before I get into why, I want to thank DeepFuckingValue for all his hard work. You sir, are a legend.

Now, as for GME, even after it's legendary run this year, a case can be made that it is still deeply undervalued. Ryan Cohen changed everything, and his involvement is everything to the bull thesis and why I believe GME is currently going through a dramatic revaluation.


We are currently in a massive stock market bubble, and the powers behind that have no intention of letting it pop anytime soon, so the fact stocks are trading at valuations not seen since the dot com bubble makes sense to me. I have no idea how far it will inflate, or how quickly it will pop, and I certainly can't tell you when it will pop, but for now, it's still getting blown. TSLA is currently trading a bit higher than 20 times TTM revenue and is worth $666 Billion. AMZN is about 5x and worth nearly $1.6 Trillion. Ryan Cohen's CHWY is closer to 5.5x TTM revenue and worth about $35 Billion. These are stocks known and valued by wallstreet as tech companies, yet the primary business of TSLA is an automaker, AMZN is mainly a retailer, and CHWY sells dog food.


Over the last 12 months, GME generated $7.3 billion of revenue. After closing 3/12 @ $264.50 a share, the company was worth ~$18.4 billion, so it's currently trading about 2.5 times TTM revenue. I think this is too low.


**Sidenote - for all the boomers that want to focus on earnings, how did that go over the last decade in regards to tech stocks? In this era, in a market bubble, that type of metric is outdated, albeit a metric I focused too much on in the past, hence my own personal investing underperformance. EPS doesn't matter, even though that's what's taught in the IVY league. Money is gushing out of the FED, interest rates are historically low, and if AMZN taught us anything it's to earn as little as possible as long as possible as long as revenue goes up, letting the company avoid any and all taxes. Grow quickly to tell wallstreet real earnings are coming in a few years, invest for the long term and one day turn on the earning switch once you've reach scale. AMZN has destroyed nearly every other retailer, and the stock has certainly outperformed all others, and as Bezos stands over the carcasses of bankrupt stores his stock still trades over 70x EPS. Ryan Cohen knows this, CHWY is proof.**


Back to GME - With Cohen leading, I have yet to see any bear thesis explain why the stock should trade at a lower revenue multiple than CHWY. If you are worried about debt (which I don't think you should given my statements above), CHWY has $200 million in debt, with almost $1 billion in assets - call it a 5 to 1 ratio. GME has $1.2 billion in debt, and $2.8 billion in assets, so more like 2.5 to 1 ratio. Does that mean GME should trade at half the revenue multiple as CHWY? I doubt it. If GME needed cash for their debt, they would have issued stock by now, but they don't, so Cohen and crew are comfortable with GME's debt and anyone buying the stonk should be too.


Now, looking to the future, if you're buying are diamond handing GME, simply ask do you believe in Cohen? He's proven with CHWY his ability to succeed and scale business, and I believe in him, and think the GME story is just starting. Here's a few free business strategy idea's I'm willing to offer that would at the very least get GME to a CHWY level revenue multiple -

·         Implement a subscription model like CHWY has. Sure, others may offer this, but Cohen knows how to execute

·         Repurposing and leveraging GME retail locations to a ""Gamer Stop"". This idea has already been mentioned. Gamers now have a place to meet and play. Offer drinks/food and a LAN for all. Again, subscription model where people pay a monthly/yearly membership for unlimited access. Wallstreet loves recurring revenues. I'm not sure if CHWY as brick and mortar, but there's a value add to physical presence if used properly. Why else would Amazon buy Whole Foods and open book stores in strip malls?

·         Do a 5 for 1 stock split. Show the street the board actually believes in the future, that $18 billion valuation is just the beginning of gains to come. The days of a struggling retailer are over, and management is confident even with the recent stock volatility it doesn't have to worry about a single digit stock price anymore. With fresh stimmy and a large short interest still, you could expect a large move higher in the price like TSLA saw after the 5-1 split.

·         After the stock split, focus on getting the financials in order to get included back in the S&amp;P 500. Issue a secondary if needed. Perhaps use a secondary to further bolster the balance sheet.

·         Embrace GME has become a cultural phenomenon. Partner with Reddit. Advertise with memes on social media. Offer promotions to apes. Own the fact GME is going down in history and make it a springboard for the company's future. People that have never been gamers have heard about Game Stop now, use it to continue to grow the brand.


There's much more that can and will be done in the transformation of the company I believe. DFV has been right all along that GME does offer DEEP FUCKING VALUE and the turnaround story is real. So what are realistic price targets? At 5.5x revenue, GME is worth $40 billion, close to $600/share. A fresh round of stimmy checks used to buy the stock could easily make this happen, and NO, it would not be overvalued, just valued on par with another Cohen lead company CHWY. Could GME get to a TSLA level valuation of 20x revenue? Depends on the transformation and execution, but if so it would be a $146 billion company, and the stock would be over $2,000/share. While I would need to see more on the turnaround plan for that valuation, it is not outside the realm of possibility to see the stock at that price given the current investing bubble we find ourselves. This won't happen overnight, and with the massive short interest expect more volatility, especially when they change the rules in the middle of the game like they have. This is not financial advice, do your own homework and take responsibility for your own investment decisions.


Disclaimer - I have been trading the stock this year, both buying and selling calls and stock. I exercised a $260 call option today (3/12/21). I will own 102 shares 3/15/2021. I own other stocks and options besides GME, this is not a YOLO. My position in GME will be the 3rd largest in my portfolio. I do not have an exit strategy for my GME position upon writing this, but will trim my position in half if it doubles to play only with ""house money"", as that is a standard tactic I use with all my stock investments and part of my risk management strategy.",I believe GME is undervalued.
