1,m6jjti,"It seems to me as a short time reddit person with low karma, but early retail investing adopter (robinhood 2017)that it is easy for well off people to make comments and manipulate the group with little karma amd time because of their investment size. I am starting to think that a group that was started to help the average investor get up fell into setting  the traps that the hedgies have set up for decades. We have read the investment periodicals(in the past) and made investments, to only realize they are giving us the info at the end so we can pump up their profits and be left as bag holders. Is there really that much of a difference here? People that make posts of profits/losses and tell us to hold forever never show what shares they sold for profits along the way. Its easy to show you have a position, why not share the transactions along the way for those particular companies? I only have 14 shares across 3 platforms for gme(avg $180 a share), and still holding on the green side waiting for my 🚀to the planet of the apes. Just tired that every post I make, none of wich is negative or breaks the rules is deleted and I am banned for days.(even when I get upvotes and awards) I am no day trader manipulating this group like many that have been here for awhile nor an intern. I am just an asshole that has been using robinhood to make more money from investing  than saving in a  bank that pays next to no interest on a xmas club account. 

Ps I already started my exit from robinhood when I got burned in January.

1. Three different posts showing loss porn in the three figures on shares that haven’t even been sold yet. 
2. A guy asking how to sell covered calls without getting a day trade violation. 
3. A guy posting 1500 share position in a $1.6 stock

I can’t take this anymore. Legit good memes get fucked by the automod and shit like this is just all over new every time I check. Here’s what I think should be done: 

1. Set a WSB comment karma requirement before you’re allowed to post. 
2. After that’s in place, chill with the automod going ballistic on everything. 
3. After that, a paper trading competition. 
4. After that, set the sub to private for a few months.
