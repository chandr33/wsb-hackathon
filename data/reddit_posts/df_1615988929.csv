""We're about to publish-I'm  hoping it's within a week or two- our new forecasts. Our confidence in Tesla has gone up for a number of reasons."" Then she goes on to give reasoning. ""So you might imagine that price targets have gone up considerably""

Within two week of March 8th is March 22nd. 

Her price targets in early 2020 were (accounting for split):

bull case: $3000/share

base case: $1400/share

bear case: $300/share

So what is Cathie's new price target going to be? I truly believe her bull case will be $5k - $6k. I don't care if you agree that TSLA could ever reach that price. That's not what this post is about. Here's something we might be able to agree on.. that with this extraordinarily higher price target, TSLA's share price will skyrocket because.. Queen Cathie and because.. TSLA

Here's some options:

4/16 $800c's \~$15.00 each, look to sell around $60.00 each (4 bagger)

A lot of analysts are raising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"".

Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.

The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.

Two important dates:

April 14, voting on the merger takes place

On or about April 20, the merger is completed

I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.

I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.

# Possible plays:

1. Buy in low and sell before the merger if you're satisfied with the gains.
2. Buy in low or high as long as APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY share. For this option it doesn't matter how the price is as long as APHA is still the cheaper of the two AND it's 83.81% of a TLRY share.

Why 83.81%

Every APHA share held through the merger will be turned into .8381 of a TLRY share. So for example:

100 APHA

20 TLRY

20 + (100 x .8381) TLRY = 103 TLRY

83 TLRY merged from 100 APHA would cost (@ current price \~$19.3): $1,601.9

83 TLRY bough directly as TLRY would cost (@ current price \~$25.5) : $2,116.5

So you save $514.6 by buying APHA instead.

That math is true no matter how high the price of either gets. If TLRY becomes more expensive and APHA stays around the same, even better. If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company.

&amp;#x200B;

IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind.

# TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting. April 20, merger). Buy low, sell high. If long, only buy if APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY. If short, do whatever the fuck you want.
