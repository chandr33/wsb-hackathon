46,lxm252,"I’m seeing this ticker get plugged a lot in the last 48hrs. Have I seen any quality DD? Not really. Have I seen any reputable accounts endorse it? Nope. Is the post history and discussion on these threads legit? It sure doesn’t seem that way. 

I’ve been a heavy lurker of WSB since the GME rise and this community has vibe. I’m not an OG but have noted when og’s post on what it used to be and I was here pre 2million and I’ve watched closely (I live on refreshing new) how this sub has evolved over the last 2 months. 

UWMC started popping up so I checked it out and saw that a bottom could be nearing so I put in a tiny bit just to watch it (10@9.80). I then went back to dig for some real DD. Problem is, there is none. This has a P&amp;amp;D feel and an ugly stench. I was bummed when RKT took off (without me on it and there was good DD on it) but the plummet got me hopeful that maybe some of the gains gets funneled into GME (I have a position). Which leads me back to UWMC.  It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t look right. It doesn’t seem right. 

If UWMC is a hedge distraction, involving yourself only helps them. If you’ve done your own DD and believe, awesome. I for one won’t be tossing anything more at it. Good luck out there.

My original post was taken down and I’m not sure why. I’m not hip to all the rules. If the opening is any indication, I think it bolsters my theory. And to the folks that think I’m GME focused. I am but wouldn’t be sad if it drops to the 80s, that’s called a fire sell and I love buying shit on sale.

Edit: The main point of this post wasn’t to be a conspiracy but to be weary of the hype. Do your own DD. If you like the stock then buy it. The whole you better get on board now crowd is sketch and was why I posted this in the first place. Make your money. Do what you like, I don’t care either way. I wish everybody all the tendies.

Edit 2: Check out user whiteytighties comment thread. Sound thoughts on why it’s a good investment and also giving a bit of credence to my thoughts.",It’s time to talk about UWMC,0.55,1614869091,wsrider03
