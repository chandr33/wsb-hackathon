1. deposit money from bank account using instant deposit
2. buy an option or stock that can't go tits up (GME)
3. move all the money from your bank account the deposit would be taken from into a different account
4. Profit from a interest free loan (can't go tits up)

I accidently did this a couple days ago and I got into a GME option that printed for me. Robinhood told me I had an account deficit and didn't do anything else. I have since sold those options for 4x what I paid for.

59,m22lnh,"[**GME**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/) **($330)** stock is doing well... very well in recent days... in part due to a recent announcement that it will seek to reinvent itself into a e-commerce business model. 

The two biggest e-commerce platforms are Ottawa-based Shopify **(**[**SHOP**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/shop/?p=shop)**: $1,109**), and Shopify's biggest competitor as of date that is, Texas-based BigCommerce  **(**[**BIGC**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BIGC/?p=BIGC)**: $59.00).** Of course, there are many other e-com options available, for instance, Wix **(**[WIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WIX/?p=WIX)**: $303).** 

Is GME already using any of these (or perhaps another) e-commerce platform? If not, has it indicated which platform it plans on using? Or, perhaps no indication whatsoever has been provided by GME, in which case it will be interesting to see what decisions are made on this level, and how share prices will be affected (if at all).","GME to ...

Double check your sell limits. If you think this is going higher than 420.69, fucking remove it now before this thing rockets past it (it could even happen today).
