Checked Robinhood news during one of my nightly panic attacks and it looks like Palantir has a new 6 year partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia. It's apparently the 9th largest international automotive parts manufacturer in the world and #1 for vehicle interiors and emission control technology. One in three automobiles is equipped by Faurecia. While they were hit with a bribery scandal in 2006 that caused the CEO to resign, all that says to me is that they're playing to win and that they know rules are meant to be broken, baby.

Palantir AI is everywhere and only expanding It's in France making car parts. It's in treehouses. It's in Japan scanning all the hentai. It's in ancient China via the mysteries of Qi Gong that Alex Karp practices daily. I don't know what else to tell you, DYOR.

I am a lone lurker and have been for quiet a while but recently I have had a question pop into my head. 

I'm not very Stock Savvy but I want to be and I don't see a reason why to not get into day trading. I don't plan on doing it as a full time progression, but as something that could or couldn't bring some extra cash flow. If it does or doesn't I'm not to concerned. 

The two questions I have are this. 

1. What is a good app or website for day trading? I'm not sure as to what most people use or where to start in deciding whether a platform for trading is good or not. 

2. Am I stupid for wanting to buy Roblox stock? Like I personally have a good feeling on the stock but I don't know if it's just a dumb whim that I am wanting to follow.

69,m2z3y8,"Alright Ladies and Gentlemen,

It’s time for another stock tip from Uncle Mack Daddy Matty that I think is about to rip (higher.) If anyone got on board with the Tilray trade that I posted BEFORE the GA Senate Runoff (even when a bunch of people were telling me “No fucking way Democrats can take control of Congress“ in several different forms) you may have made a fortune. I made a pretty penny myself ($20k) but would have made even more ($250k) had I stuck to my original plan... yeah still kicking myself for that one.

Anyways onward and upward. I’m about to drop yet another bomb for ya’ll. What is it I’m talking about this time? Yes, you guessed correct: I’m talking about Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. an extremely undervalued engineering and construction company with a strong focus on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) that could be a huge benefactor from Biden’s incoming infrastructure plan.

Now this one is right up your ass.. I mean alley. Why? Well for one it’s heavily shorted: \~17% of the shares outstanding and about 32% of their low float, which currently stands at about 16.21m. It also seems as if its heavily manipulated by institutions. They own \~32% of the shares, and yet the price has been plummeting since its 52 week high of \~$24.

Now that the ARA is being signed as I write this, phase 2 of stimulus is ready for proposal, an infrastructure plan, which currently stands at about $2t, to modernize America’s infrastructure which just received a C- grade from ASCE. Biden’s new proposal, which will be announced tonight, ”aims to achieve carbon-free power generation by 2035 and creates “millions” of union jobs.” And according to Raymond James “Do not think of the infrastructure bill as just roads and bridges. Democrats view an infrastructure bill as the ‘infrastructure’ necessary to build the economy of the future.”

Which brings me to IEA, “a leader in energy and heavy civil infrastructure construction.” This company had a big run from a low of $1.64 to a high of $24.13 and for good reason: it‘s initiatives align with the new administration’. And even after a nearly 15 bag run, it sits at a minuscule \~$375m market cap., about 20% of it’s $1.75b in 2020 revenues. In other words, this puppy still has some serious room to run in my opinion.

Now we can compare this to its main competitor in my eyes MasTec, Inc. whose market cap is about right on par with its yearly revenues. Because of the fragmented nature of the construction and engineering industry, margins are low which is why these companies don’t trade at high valuations relative to their production. However I believe this industry is due for some serious consolidation in the coming years and that should bring the value of IEA up and more in line with its peers’ valuations as prospects for margins grow. Currently IEA‘s profit margin is low and at nearly zero which is certainly a negative.

With the new infrastructure plan coming online, which could also become go live through the reconciliation process that the stimulus bill just did, I think IEA’s growth prospects look better than ever. They have over $2b in contracts backlogged and are winning new contracts left and right without this bill even in play. Imagine the possibilities....

Cheers and happy investing,

DJ Matty Nice
