* From the image above you can gather the following information
   * This stock has a P/E of 7.5 way way way low - this is price to earnings for you apes that are still on the gorilla teet and barely understand market cap.
   * They pay a 2.00 dividend which is a 3.5% yield. Just owning the stock you will make monies.
   * They are small, 1.5B market cap, but profitable.

# The comparison to peers!!!!!!!!!!

* Look at the chart below
   * it's P/E is way better than the industry average.... 7.5 vs 21 this is incredible.
   * It's Price to cash flow is 8x better.
   * It's price to sales is nearly 9x better....... This is absolutely insane.
   * Price to sales is 4x better
   * Price to book is 6x better this

I am not a financial analyst- just my two cents. This came on my radar from a SA article. I believe the author is correct that this could double in the short term.
