12,m3yia1,"I'm in Australia so I basically have to be nocturnal to watch the market. I haven't been this sleep deprived since I did overnights at McDonald's in high school, although they were nowhere near this exciting. I've been holding since early February and plan to do so until this thing moons. The currency conversion has been kicking my arse though; I bought my 11th share at $280 USD last night which cost me about $360 AUD, but I don't care. I've put almost 2K into this thing by now, which seems small compared to most of you, but I haven't believed in something like this in a long time. We need people to hold these shares, and hold them I shall. I just wanted to get an idea of where most of you plan on selling, eventually. At first it was $6942.00, then 10K, then 100K, I even read something about an AI predicting 130K. Sounds insane, but seeing as I could very well be asleep when all of this happens, I wanted to get a rough idea so I don't miss out.

Thanks in advance, fellow apea, and to those in doubt: we're all here with you. Solidarity will win us this thing, so hold on with everything you have - we'll all be right there with you, holding until our knuckles bleed.

Just a couple of years ago, if you wanted to save in the stock market, you had to go through an employer, be legit self employed, or have a brokerage account where you needed a $2500 minimum and had to pay $4.95 a trade.  Never had enough extra to save for such an account.  Saw the Robinhood app, downloaded it, then deleted it, and went elsewhere.  But I gotta say - if it wasn't for Robinhood's $0 commissions, Fidelity, TD, and Webull would have never followed suit.  

And the fact that a person can contribute their restaurant tips, side hustle or ebay selling money, to something that looks respectable after a little while, without the red tape and delays - is something Robinhood should be given some credit for.  I've opted for a PB&amp;J instead of take out sometimes, just to keep adding to my account.  Because in 20 years, I won't remember that meal, but the sacrifice will be worth it!  I'm patient.

You can go here https://investor.kelloggs.com/overview/default.aspx and read some boring shit but you wont so I didn't even link it.

The facts are that people are going out and doing things again which means Kellogg's products will sell much better in that environment. Their stock is down due to missing earning, whatever the fuck that means because it was only a &gt;5% miss.

This right here is not a get rich quick scheme, it is a solid investment in a company that is currently undervalued based on approaching macro level trends.
