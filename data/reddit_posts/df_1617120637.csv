64,mgk9vf,"Registration for Tesla's 100M Carbon Capture competition opens April 22, 2021. I came across an article about a company called Pond Technologies but the analytics that have looked at if they could qualify were ...well...in a word...useless. So here is a little speculation on if their business model could qualify.


To qualify for the competition the company has to have a working model that can carbon capture. CHECK. Pond grows algea in specialized containers to absorb fairly good quantities of CO2.


The plan needs to be able to reduce carbon emissions in the gigatons by 2050...hmmmm. Let's see.


Gigaton = 1,000,000,000 tons. The world produces approxamilty 27 Gigatons a year in C02 (37 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions with CO2 representing about 76%). Of that a conservative estimate puts industry and electricity contributing to about 20%. Shipping tankers are 1.7%. So let's give another conservative estimate of roughly...say about 5 gigatons per year that could be targeted for reduction by Pond Technologies?


Now. The company has indicated that their tech would reduce CO2 at the point of emission by 40%. So thats becomes 2 gigatons per year if they controlled the entire market.¬†


2050 is 29 years away. If they started today at full capacity they could reduce 58 gigatons of CO2. Keep in mind this isn't factoring in the reduction of C02 from reducing demands on the production of agricultural that would come from the harvesting of the alega as a biomass foodstock.


Just bear with me cause obviously that is not at all realistic.


Lets say that PONDS is able to successfully target 0.5% of the sector by the end of 2025 and increase market control by 25% year over year for the next 20 years. That's a start of 10,000,000 tons a year and a total of 3.6 gt of C02 captured by 2045 and final control of 43% of that market (remember C02 emissions are on the rise and as carbon capture improves the amount we produce will go up as well because...well business...so control of the market will be significantly lower in 2045. The 43% is for today's emissions but could be well under 40% by 2045). Now for the next 5 years leading to 2050 they reduce about 0.8 gt per year. With no additional growth of market control that's 4gt over 5 years. So a final total of 7.6gt by 2050.


Ability to reduce in the gigatons? Hypothetic CHECK.


Now the question is: does Pond Technologies have a viable business model to even get to 0.5% control of carbon capture market by 2025?



One of the 1 million liter tanks (not as big as you think) that they use can reduce 2700 tons of CO2 per year. So that would require 3704 installations by 2025 to meet 10,000,000 target. The cost of a large tank is anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 so they need 55 million alone for the minimum infrastructure (the tanks). Include install + maintenance (pure conjecture) let's say you need another 176m. So cost by 2025 is 241m. Current cap is mere 26.66M.


Is this financially feasible for them? In addition to taking a fee for CO2 reductions form emmitors, they also plan to sell the biomass for roughly $1000 per ton. With each tank producing as much as 1350 tons of algea a year that's 1.35m per tank so 5B dollars revenue for all 3704 tanks if they get there. Of course that's ludicrous. Let's say they make 15% profit on the sale of algea after all costs are factored in (conservative) that's still 750m in revenue. Minus your 241m cost plus all other expenses you are still sitting with amazing margins.


So. That 50M top prize awould go a long way to covering the costs of the infrastructure and would help create a massively profitable business that would reduce C02 emissions and help address growing food shortages. Not to mention algea has other great uses in a wide range of sectors.


Conclusion: If Pond Technologies enters the competition they already have a model that could win the competition.

66,mgkae8,"There is a lot of talk about ""being good people"" when we moon from GME but when I post a question to try and help people in my life who are unaware of GME, my post gets removed from r/GME which is sad to see, I am just looking for answers. There are people in my life that I cannot convince to invest in GME. Does that mean I want them to suffer? Absolutely not. What the fuck is wrong with people. The only people I want to suffer are the hedgefunds, not normal people.

Although my portfolio is 100% GME across 3 brokers, I can't convince my family members. I can't blame them, as they're from an older generation and do not really understand what is going on. Despite this, I do not want to see people close to me suffer as a result of hedgies completely fucking over the market to cover their positions.

They're mainly invested in things like Tesla, NVidia, SPY and other boomer-type stocks. I don't know much other than GME and told them maybe water ($AWK) would be a good idea. They think gold/silver. Any advice would be great.
