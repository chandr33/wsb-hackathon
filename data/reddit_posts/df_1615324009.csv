8,m1gd26,"So I was buying long OTM Call options for my favorite stock.  Thought I was making money buying long LEAPS on $800 GME Calls.   Then I read a few posts here that educated me (wish I saved them, so I could credit) - but those posts told me what a moron I was.   Long-term Calls don't help the push to 100k much.   It doesn't put pressure on Melvin and the others HFks.  

Instead, the lessons I read here on WSB pointed me to ITM Calls.  It would cost some money, but I should buy ITM Call options, and THEN execute the contract when the price rises.  Take the shares from whatever dope didn't believe in the GStop.

So I bought some 3-19 $130 Calls.  Then I waited for the price to soar.  Now they are in the money -- WAY in the money!

Do I cash in? Fuck no. Immo represent !!! So I sold anything I could to raise funds. And just now, I pulled the trigger. I just executed the contract and told Fidelity to go get me my shit !!!

Someone's gotta give up their ITM shares !! HA HA! Felt so amazing to pull that off!

Just hope it's not ""Ape on Ape"" crime. Cuz I love the idea that I'm taking shares from some MM or HFk that gambled the wrong way.

Thanks for the lessons y'all.  See you on the moon.

44,m1gffx,"I was trying to understand this:
Assume retail do not exist.
Institution X hold 100% of float, so all the float.
HF borrow 50% of float from X and sell it short.
X buys the 50% and now hold 150% of float.
X recall the shorted stock (or whatever happens that make the HF need to buy back the shares)
HF buys the shares back except that NO SHIT, X likes the stock too much (or is an index fund which doesn't need or can't sell for balance reason).

1) Is this infinite squeeze? how does it work out if X just want to see the world burn and would not sell even for 100 trillion USD/share while at the same time opposing any issuance of share because it holds a majority of the stocks?

2) If price goes to Andromeda, how do MM cover considering that X won't sell any share?

3) How does this even fucking work? If X just buy a share, but that share is created by a short, that's dilution. How does the example of A lends to B who sells short to C who lends to D if it's just X and HF? X lend to HF, HF sells short to X (200% of float), X lend to HF, HF sells short to X (400% float). X diamond hand artificially created stocks forever, what if the company issue a dividend?
