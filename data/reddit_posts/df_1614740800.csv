84,lwk1ap,"Hey all,

Here to talk about a company with alot of potential that isn’t GME or RKT. I know, I know, sad and im retarded and should just buy those stocks

Lordstown motors is IMO a heavily overlooked and undervalued EV stock that has not had its fair chance to flourish yet. 

-They will be the first electric pickup truck to market -They have a 600 acre factory right here in the USA
- A partnership with Camping world ( I know lame but distribution= 🚀 )
-100k preorders
-45k price tag on the pickup after government incentives (52k without)
-Backing by GM
 
All with only a 3.4B market cap. 
If only half of the none binding preorders got filled(which is unlikely because the average order size is 600 and you need to set up charging stations for all those trucks at there destinations and that takes time and planning) that would be 2.6B in revenue. Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven. 


Analyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.

They are also now reprinting old articles of a very early “skateboard”(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.

Another fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.

Steve Burns the CEO has entered the Lordstown Endurance into a 290 mile Baja race in Mexico to prove the concept. 

The race is in April, Earnings are next week, the moon this year. 

This isnt investment advice, I am clearly retarded and I wrote this all while I was licking the windows on the short bus
