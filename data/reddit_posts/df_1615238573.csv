**Currently:** 

I've been buying stocks on and off for 3 years with 3k, mainly in pot and EV stocks on RH. I deactivated my account and switched to Schwab in the past month. I started buying OTC stocks. Yes, I know the risk! 

**Plan:**  
I've pretty much most all of my gains in the past month because of the dip (meh, it happens). With that said my overall plan is to:

\- Invest seriously in Weed, tech, and eco-friendly ETFs (most of my shares) by selling all stocks with less than 100 shares. Exceptions are WKHS and LIVX.

\- The rest (1/3ish of my portfolio) will be for OTC stocks in the same sectors mentioned. I am comfortable investing (i.e., prob losing) $1k into this. No more.

**Reasoning:**  
Look, I'm here to make money lol. I want to invest in something that is relatively stable like ETFs.\*\* To me, it's a bit silly to invest in expensive stocks. I can only buy a small amount, and if I sell it, I get a marginal return. I don't mind wasting $200 on OTC stocks. I've wasted money on worse things.

59,m0qq9w,"Hi all, looking for some help re: entering a single entry order with two exist orders so everything counts as a single day trade. Specifically, I'd like to enter the market at a given price, exit half of my shares when a certain percentage of profit is achieved, and at that take profit level, automatically add a trailing stop so the second half of my shares can run as price moves. E.g.,

Buy Order: 200 shares at $5
Take Profit (15%): 100 shares at $5.75, to trigger a trailing stop loss for remaining 100 shares at 15%

The thought is that after securing a 15% profit on the first 1/2 of my shares, I would like to setup the order so a trailing stop loss is automatically added for the second 1/2 of my shares at 15% of the take profit price. I've messed around with OTO orders and trailing stop orders and am not seeing how to make this work.

I realize I could just submit two orders, but this will count as 2 day trades which I'd like to avoid.

Do you like being in an abusive relationship with a someone, in this case a broker, that's designed to front-run you, and not only take your money, but sell your information, and look good doing it? 

We have learned that Robinhood is the antithesis of its name. 

You have been told to delete your account and move somewhere else or risk losing your money through no fault of your own. 

A stock broker that doesn't allow you to buy stocks is not a stock broker. 

What do we like here on Wall Street Bets? Making fucking money and karma.

I'm extremely bored in my stupid life and actually I'm looking to donate some money to other people, my idea is to start doing damn investments in dividend stocks to buy an motherfucking lamborghini in like 5 years, is it possible? Not at all...

We're starting with initial investment equal to 3500 USD (because I have some money in shitty stocks but we'll ignore that). Then I'm going to add 200 USD per week for my portfolio which gives 10 400 USD per year of free capital.

Cost of lamborghini is like... 350 000 USD, which means I'll need to gains arround 1 000% after three years - target is clean.
