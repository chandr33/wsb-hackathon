50,m3nwp8,"Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

Hedge funds and big money mostly do not buy options... they sell them. They have a BIG incentive to drive share prices to the max pain price so that they can let them profit the most off of the derivatives market.  

While the max pain price isn't always great indicator of exactly where a share price will end up by Friday, it is a fantastic indicator of price direction. I would advise referencing the max pain price before EVERY trade you place to avoid bull and bear traps.

[http://maximum-pain.com/options/fsr](http://maximum-pain.com/options/fsr)

Don't rely solely on a share's max pain price, but before you go to place a trade use it to tell you if it's a good idea or a bad one. I love this sub and I want to see you guys bleed these manipulative bastards dry, so here is my gift to you.
