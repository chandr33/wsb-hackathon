21,m21vjn,"Okay I'm a graduate student who can do analysis to a certain extent. The quantitative value of that extent is similar to big hedge funds. The qualitative value is learned by reading Warren Buffett and other books.

So here's the deal. GME has been in a partnership with Microsoft (who's current CEO is an alumni lol). Microsoft is a beautiful behemoth only tainted by Apple so that both companies can show a farce of enmity while enjoying massive surges in their companies. Yes Microsoft is that smart and always has been. So, since GME struck a deal with Microsoft last year, it was only bound to rise. Microsoft doesn't like losing money because it represents tons of people and needs that money to improve those products and also stay at the top. (If you are a Linux user, well I also use Linux for specific projects so don't even get started)

Now since Microsoft has plugged the gaps (implicitly) due to management and strategy, it's getting behind Gamestop for the long run. Microsoft may not directly invest in Gamestop stocks because it already did a partnership. However, it can always promote it's agenda through its employees and the tons of companies it owns. It's not against the law to promote your business interest. So yeah, GME is going to keep on rising and skeptics are going to bitch about it like they did with Amazon and Tesla. It's not their fault, they got rich and fear change as it comes with a lot of risk. So hold on to your stocks because this will keep going up as the gaming industry is on the rise. If this post receives more than 100 upvotes or whatever, I will do a detailed qualitative analysis for this. And yes I got skin in the game too (it's only about 1grand because I am a student under shit ton of debt but I hope you get the point).",Ape analyst's view on GME's future rise.,1.0,1615394740,Professional_Kiwi_68

- Take up a martial art.

- Read a few books or digest content from minds who figured it out before you (Mark Cuban, Bezos, Mr. Burns doesn’t matter.) Finance related or not, anybody you look up to can provide some influence to your character.

- Be sparing with your boasts of wealth. Whether you’d like to or not. The attention from this gains both positive and negative attraction. Become a good “bullshit sniffer” so that your money isn’t parted with you by force. 

- Reinvest, you fucks. GameStop is just the beginning. Let’s keep it going til we reach the stratum of what can be achieved. Someday I’d like to band together with a few of you retards and start a new country. We can make it happen and we’ve done it before virtually. Let’s make it a reality.

https://a2-finance.com/en/issuers/gamestop/dividends

At the bottom is a chart of last price and average price with dividend yield differences. At $40/share, with a 3.56% dividend yield, the return was $1.44.

9.896 is ~3x that and the price of GME at peak was 483, so let's round down for simplicity and make it an even 400.

So theoretically, if GME sits at 400 for the rest of time, the dividend yield per share (standard procedure) for GME could be:

(1.44 x 3) = $4.32 per share @ $400/share (current price) @ 9.896% dividend yield value.

If you have 10 shares, that's $43 extra in dividends. 100 shares is $432 extra. 1k shares is 4,320.

# DeepFuckingValue

has 100,000 shares and 500 calls pending exercise (ITM) or 500x100 = 50,000 shares.

At the end, DFV could own 150,000 shares of GME.

With 9.896% dividends per share of ~4.32 (rounded average) @ 150,000 shares gets him (2x a year of dividend returns as per a-2 finance)... $1,296,000 per year in extra passive income.
