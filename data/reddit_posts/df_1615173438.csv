0,m06k4v,"hey guys im trying to learn how do to do proper DD and was wondering if you could tell me if im screwing it up (i am a gme ape but actually want to learn how to do stocks right)  
 

So a few weeks ago when i was doing DD for GME I was checking a bunch of stocks that were heavily shorted, and UTZ was 55% shorted (sorry, no screenshots). So I started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in August and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much? I for the most part just passively observed it for a bit. Fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6% so I look at the stock and it dropped from 25.89 to 23.35 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UTZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UTZ) 

So now that the short is over, I wondered if it is a good time to invest in it (my money is tied up in GME but if I had funds available) so I went to the call options to see what they had going on there and I found 7,347 call options for $30 a share as well as 1,092 @$25

so I think this is not a guarantee but I think it would be a good safe investment with almost immediate returns. plus there isn't too much risk because this company has been doing very well since it hit the market.

Where do we go from here?

By looking at FSRs 2 hr chart, we are in a juicy position. RSI is on support, chart has confirmed support from recent resistance (found on Feb. 16th), and volume is ready to breakout.

15,m06sta,"I‚Äôm just going to put my shit out there like I‚Äôve never done before. Maybe I end up regretting this... maybe I don‚Äôt.

I lean toward I‚Äôll probably regret sharing so much of my personal life. But here it goes...

I suffer from moderate to severe depression and anxiety. It‚Äôs impacted every facet of my life from career, financials and social life.  I am in a deep hole.

But I‚Äôve found comfort in the stock market. It has given me hope and determination.

Let me dive into a bit of detail... While there are many days I‚Äôd rather be dead than alive (the majority), I‚Äôm 35  and I have a 16 year old son who‚Äôs brilliant, amazing and I have no doubt will be successful. That young man gives me massive meaning and hope. I would never voluntarily leave him behind. I will never betray him by taking my own life... no matter how hard it gets... and let me tell you, I can‚Äôt even fathom it being harder than it has been the last year... I would never give up.

You have no idea what I‚Äôve endured and am enduring as we speak. I won‚Äôt eve get into it... but I‚Äôm fucked right now.

I came up with a game plan in 2017 and I‚Äôm attempting to execute it as we speak. I have to believe that GME was a sign... because I started my plan just months before GME. Anyone who knows me well, knows I‚Äôve been talking about this since 2017. That‚Äôs when I opened my Robinhood account.

My plan was to slowly invest in industries that I believed were the future... gaming, renewable energy, and cannabis.

I initially started in renewable resources... then cannabis... Was about to invest in Zynga... Then GME happened.

I play a bit of COD with my son... But I was a pioneer and BAMF back in the day with HALO.

I saw the GME hype and bought in at $300 and the dip at $180... Then a few more on the way down.

I got pulled over tonight.. Working my second job delivering food... The cop let me go because I had several bags of food... but notified me that I had 4 warrants for my arrest in other counties.

I‚Äôm so fucked.

I was on the bounce back right when covid hit the US... But was also dealing with a kidney problem. At the beginning of March, I had a kidney procedure In which they placed a stent through my entire urinary tract that was to be removed after 1 month.

My company was small and ended my position as lead of research and development when the stock market crashed. I had a certain amount of time to get the stent removed before optional procedures ended and so did my insurance.

My insurance ended and minor procedures were canceled due to covid. I applied for unemployment and it immediately went into ‚Äúunder investigation‚Äù. It stayed there for several months. Meanwhile, I Exhausted my savings to the point where I started delivering for Postmates (an absolutely terrible and predatorilial company) who took advantage of the situation. I tried to find another full time job.

I didn‚Äôt find another job until September... and it was a contract to possibly full time job after 6 months as a temp... I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for shit insurance benefits.

If you forgot about the stent in my urinary tract, let me remind you.. It‚Äôs still inside of me because i could never afford to get it removed. It has been the most painful situation of my life... It causes severe pain every day and all day... Times 10 when I‚Äôm dehydrated.

I‚Äôve managed to cover my rent... I‚Äôve managed to feed myself and pay for utilities... I‚Äôve managed to pay my $500 a month child support... but i have not managed to pay to remove this stent or the fines for driving with expired plates and the warrants that are now out for my arrest.

If you‚Äôre wondering about unemployment... I applied. It went into pending for months until i took it upon myself to deliver food for postmstes, sometimes earning less than minimum wage. I took care of what i could take care of. But once I resorted to getting paid minimum wage full time, I couldn‚Äôt apply for unemployment anymore.. Which I had to do after a few months.

I finally received $2700  from unemployment after 6 months of being unemployed. Which wasn‚Äôt nearly enough to cover the debt i incurred over 6 months of unemployment.

I yoloed 150 into something that cannot be mentioned in here... made $500 in profit and then put it into GME..just to lose most of it. I‚Äôve since built up 4 shares.. plan to buy more on my next pay day if it doesn‚Äôt shoot before.

Let‚Äôs be real... the last $500 i yoloed into GME would‚Äôve never have saved me... I‚Äôm in way deeper than that. But it did give me hope.

Even if GME reaches 1k... it at least helps me.. If it reaches 10k.. Then it gives me a chance to clear the books. If it reaches 100k, it gives me a fresh start at life... an absolute mulligan.

I‚Äôm working two jobs.. looking for a third... I‚Äôm not expecting an easy way out... i just want to remove this extremely painful stent and get a restart. I don‚Äôt need to get rich.. I don‚Äôt expect to get rich. I just need something... anything.

We live in a society that‚Äôs extremely unkind... and I‚Äôm totally not looking for charity.. I don‚Äôt want charity.

I‚Äôve always expected to pay my own way.. I won‚Äôt even ask for help.. but I need a break.. Something... anything. Even if it‚Äôs just getting this stent removed... So i can work harder... but I need something.

I‚Äôm so ashamed of needing a break. And again, I‚Äôm not looking for a handout. Just praying GME helps me... even if just a little.

I wish the best to all of us. I‚Äôm holding... I will continue to hold because I believe in this... I‚Äôm looking for a 3rd job... I will continue supporting myself and my son... I will never give up no matter what happens with GME.","Delete if not allowed, but I‚Äôm fighting for my life...So please read before deleting. If my post is common...

I can't find anything on the next Ex-Div Date, but judging from previous patterns it looks like it should be coming in the next 2 to 3 weeks, and there most recent dividen was $0.25.

I'm not planning on holding there stock for that long, but seems like the stock should rise quite a bit by the 19th.

I also noticed that GEO has more puts out of the üí∞ than AMC has in the üí∞.
