81,m24y1s,"So i invested what little money i had left (actually even more than i could actually afford) a the week  before GME spiked at 180 about 2 weeks ago. My gains were almost 9k and i was so happy to finally get some of that sweet life changing money! but then the hedgies shorted the stock into oblivion again, making me lose all of the shares and money i had build up. Because of my broker's (Capital) margin close out. 

They will sell your shares even if you didn't want to sell. I was so furious at myself for not just selling for an amount that would greatly benefit me. But especially at my broker, for that shitty mechanic.

But i had about €400 euros left, and i knew GME wasn't even nearly done. All wasn't lost yet so i just threw it all back in, in order to hopefully make my money back and then some. 

Everything went fine and dandy, i was up a lot of money and i was so happy gme was helping me crawl back up. I was once again back up almost 10k (I bought some with margin because GME kept going up) and i kept holding because i had faith in GME. 

But, unfortunately today the same thing happened again. Which left me with absolutely nothing now. 0 bucks in my account. I talked to my broker, but there's no way they can help me. 

I know i shouldn't have used margin to buy. I know i was too overzealous. But i just wanted to make some money while investing in my favorite stock. Money that would help me get out of my debt and my shitty situation. Money that i can actually use, instead of those hedgefucs that just hoard the money from poor (and rich) retail.

But once again, the hedgies win, and take more from the poor. At least, in my situation.

I have no idea what to do right now as this was literally all of the money i had, and i'm kind of feeling sick right now. Especially seeing GME fly back up in a heartbeat, knowing if i could've helt on to my shares i would've still had all of my gains..

Alright guys, do you remember when the share dropped at 12.15 and reached its bottom of 12.45.

[Here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208?mod=mw_RHF) is an article published at 12.43.

The reason for the article is solely FUD and fuckery.

If you read through his article you will find this part “Trading was halted five times between 12:20 and 12:50 p.m.”

Now i refuse to believe that he is a time traveling reporter, but if my time mathematics are correct, if he published this at 12.43, The so mentioned above mentioned time frame HASNT EVEN PASSED/HAPPENED YET.

I also refuse to believe that he wrote this article in 30 minutes and had it ready and edited by 12.43 while the event was still ongoing.

Just alot of fuckery my smooth ape brain can’t make sense out of.

Here’s a piece of DD for you smooth brained monkey friends.

In my last post i mentioned something about the 9th of march and the dissemination date.
So far my post aged pretty damn fckin well.

Now here’s a quick recap of what i think happened during this time.

There is a battle around 350 that the hedges CAN NOT win so this was their Magnum Opus to get it down and scare paper handed bitches.

They wanted it to drop, as you can read in the article (that was prewritten before the event) is said that it dropped by 100$ or more... Which would have been accurate were it not for our whale and shark friends.

The hedges wanted it to drop to scare us... NOT to trigger the SSR.
I have been monitoring our whale and shark friends and they excersized quite a few ITM 300 strike calls.
Which they sold when the hedges shorted, dropping the price 10% below previous market close triggering SSR.

We are nearing the endgame my friends, we have SSR for the rest of the week and a whole lot of money to spend soon (stimmy boiii).
