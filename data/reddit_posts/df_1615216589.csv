$BB DD thread: Why this retard believes the fair market value for $BB is $45. Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I'm not a financial advisor, just a retard YOLO'ing my savings into long calls, so make your own decisions.

TLDR: Blackberry is the market leader in an industry that McKinsey projects will fucking 🚀🚀🚀 to $750BN by 2030. BlackBerry has already grown their annual revenue for 2020 by 15.04% from 2019, so stap in your tendies because BB are going to the fucking moon.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/)

48,m0i49f,"My opinion article on UWMC (United Wholesale Mortgage).

Currently UWM’s president/CEO has decided to give all their brokers an ultimatum, which basically states if you want to do business with them you are not allowed to send loans to Rocket Mortgage (RKT). Here is why that is a problem and in my opinion is going to get the CEO fired and in turn create volatility in the company.

Their current ultimatum goes against everything brokers stand for. The point of being a broker is to have options so you aren’t “selling” one lenders product. Many brokers built a large part of their business on UWM’s platform while the other half of their business is in most cases built through Rocket. Meaning, most loan officers at a brokerage send 95% of their business to one of those top two lenders. So for a company like UWM to break up brokerages (if they sign that agreement, anybody that uses Quicken will have to pivot or find a new broker to work for), because they want to try to gain more market share because they have been losing massively in market share gain to Rocket over the past 2 years. I foresee many brokers revolting and possibly never going back to UWM due to their will to create a market in the industry without competition. It would be like McDonalds saying if you eat at Burger King you can’t eat at McDonalds anymore.

Also to add, UWM is a compliance nightmare in which their underwriters are extremely inconsistent, which in my opinion leaves their “dirty” books a significant factor to audits in the future.

To add, UWM has some of the best technology and support to allow brokers to send them loans easily, but with their shady tactics and a longtime CEO that will be hard to force out... there will be quite a road ahead of us.

86,m0icpf,"WSB is a casino and holds no collective inside of it, we are just a bunch of degenerate gamblers chasing our 2020 spy put losses.

there has been tons of amazing DD over the years with winning plays and it seems alot of it outside the memestonks are getting burried.

I dont know if anyone has ever been to a casino, but while they paint a rosy picture its mostly filled with people who gamble whatever money they have in the attempts to sneak one past the house and cash out on the big one, often failing miserably.

&amp;#x200B;

consider the memestonks the craps table. im not going to take the time, nor do I have the brain power to describe how it works. However when someone has hot hands in the dice game its better to wait for the next ride, or bet safe instead of trying to catch the train of the self proclaimed,"" ill roll doubles all night"" guy in the end all the screaming and yelling subsides when someone inevibilty rolls a 7 and sends the hype train down the gutter and everyone dispereses. Well it feels like a craps table with a bunch of first time casino goers who think its a place where your guaranteed to make money and all the newbies are just sitting at it waiting for the next hot roll . all the while not willing to realize that they bought in when the hype train was in full steam and will be sent chasing these losses for eternity.

the house has a take on EVERYTHING in a casino. even the poker tables against other opponents soley has a rake( takes a percentage or specific amount from each betting pot) the house is wall street and hedge funds are pitbosses. 

Sure you can get one over on them, make a good win, but its on YOU to realize that chasing losses with a -75% account( my fd account) makes you a degenerate gamble.  And the sooner you realize that , the sooner you can be accepted as a true wsber. embrace the loss and bathe in sweet sweet red as your wsb brethren welcome you with open -99% account arms.

&amp;#x200B;

you will never beat the entire casino. take your money and run before they find a way to get it back from you. enjoy your echo chambers, r/wsb will NEVER BE ONE OF THEM
