0,m1ndkt,"I see so many of you making so much money on the call options and it makes me want to try and learn how to trade options. However, I’m a broke college student with only 400 dollars in gme @100. So you guys really helped me learn about stock trading in general but I got the fever for more gains. 

I looked up call options for gme and I wanted to put some in for 255 call but the price (in ameritrade) said that I’d lose 3,000 dollars for just 1 contract. 

My first question is, does it matter if I don’t have the capital to cover those 3,000 dollars? (I’ve seen people go under 0 dollars on the stock market so I’m a little confused at what happened there). 

Secondly, if I paid the call and lost the call what would happen?",I still don’t understand option trading,1.0,1615344198,SudsiestDuke

33,m1nhd4,"There are many people who think that as GME price rises HF and other institutions short GME sell off shares of other stocks freeing up more money. This is effect on the market is sharp sell offs opposite GME rise. 

Using this line of thinking the market will majorly sell off as GME breaks into the stratosphere and doesn’t stop going. Predicting the future is hard(if I could do it I would already be a billionaire) and no one is quite sure how much the market will actually sell off. If it is volatile enough though it could cause a market sell off of 20% plus. 

This is important because if it happens in the same day and we can go through multiple circuit breakers then ultimately a trading halt for the day. This occurs when the market drops 20% in a singular day from yesterday’s closing price. If this happens this would greatly constrict the amount of time available to trade GME. I was wondering what the effects would be, would it be far more aggressive trading with people trying to get out of positions before the day ends? So when this happens should we expect it to be bullish for GME or bearish if trading time is greatly limited during the squeeze.

50,m1njq6,"UWM Holding Corporation has recently been wrecking the mortgage business and shaking up the status quo. We all know of their recent inclusion in the Russell 500 index, legitimizing the stock.

But you may also know that WSB has made $UWMC its most recent short squeeze target similar to $RKT, the company they have been challenging. But the craziest thing is that UWM *actually* makes money. Real profits, and good profits too. The company has a forward PE of 6.6 meaning it is grossly undervalued especially compared to RKT's current 255 PE ratio.

Additionally, UWM has recently bid to gain over the half the market of real estate loan brokers. Apparently, Rocket and other mortgage companies have been certifying real estate agents and other randoms as ""registered brokers"" to cut the professionals out of the game that they created. Rocket, Fairway, and UWM still rely on these brokers to provide capital financing to service the loans. But only UWM is providing the fair portion of commission to the loan agents. 

**BIG BALLS MOVE:** Last week UWM said they simply would not work with any loan broker currently doing business with Rocket Mortgage. This may seem like a huge risk, but they already have in house loan brokers that have access to capital. The only thing they can gain is the third party market of loan brokers that almost exclusively work with Rocket and Fairway (why, because they've had to until now!).

The current price is about 8.7 with a 52week low of 7.24 and high of 14.38. Without any of the hype or recent business developments, UWMC is a buy with the rest of the booming real estate market. However with these recent development and the hype about to be unleashed by WSB this is buy by a fucking longshot.
