25,m3qk75,"Alright. So 3/12 didn’t go the way we were expecting but that’s cool, we still have 3/19 quadruple witching hour and someone buying a bunch of 3/19 800c today, volume on those looked pretty big to me, idk I’m an ape. 

But, here’s what I think is going on. Someone tried to orchestrate a gamma squeeze for today and it turned out the HF had more ammo than we realized. Someone got us on the SSR with that perfectly set up strike from 350 to 180 last Wednesday. Then did it again the day after. I think they did it to bleed out any shares the HFS were sitting on through Thursday to gamma Friday. But what I think happened is they under estimated how much ammo they had. 

So on Monday I bet we see a huge spike like we did Wednesday where someone loads up on a bunch of shares so they can keep SSRing throughout the week without using shorts, then mid day tomorrow we see a huge tank from a high price to somewhere in the neighborhood of 240-50s putting us on the SSR for Tuesday.

Once we’ve been SSRed Tuesday the HF holding short positions have to sell any actual shares they have to suppress the price. Since our mystery whale bought a bunch on Monday they can SSR all week bleeding the hedges until quadruple witching hour Friday where they’ll undoubtedly have massive 3/19 calls again. 

Obviously I’m not a financial advisor this is just speculation, don’t get your hopes up, but if it happens don’t forget me. 

TL;dr Next week is gonna be a bunch of SSRs with a Thursday/Friday boom. I hope. I dunno.",Next Week GME predictions,1.0,1615581472,Saltnknepper

Sure there’s gonna be people buying more than 1400 dollars worth but the vast majority of the individual transactions going up for that spike are going to be stimmy margin buys.
