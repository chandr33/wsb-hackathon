1,m48vme,"Okay retards, it's tax season and I want to help you keep your hard earned tendies. Let me begin by saying that this will not apply to all of you. However, a lot of you will benefit from this.

The IRS provides offers for software that you can use to file your taxes for free. What's the catch? Well, there's a couple. One, you have to go through the IRS website. Two, you have to be making around 70k or less (varies by software). Some of you retards are using the same software but paying because you aren't going through the IRS website. The link for the IRS offers is below.

[https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Best Software**

* TurboTax has one of the lowest AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) ceilings but if you make the cut I would recommend using them. Free federal and state. You can import all your statements directly. It's 2021, you don't have to type shit in.
* TaxSlayer - Has one of the highest AGI ceilings and provides free state filing (Not all states).
* TaxAct - Towards the top for AGI ceilings and provides free state filing (Not all states). Not as user-friendly as TurboTax but pretty damn good.
* There are others but these 3 are the ones that provide the most and are easy to use (This is important since most of you have smooth brains).

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT - You have to use the IRS link to receive the free offers. I made it easy for you, just use the link above.**",Taxes - File For Free,1.0,1615650560,marine_guy

Since the world is going to have a increased need for water in the short and long term, people are going to have to come up with different ways of sourcing it. I think desalination would be one of the bast ways to do this since there is loads of water in the ocean ( I know that‚Äôs a bit of a smooth brain take). As the world need more water I think it would be good to buy water futures. since desalination has a byproduct of salt could you like ¬´¬†short salt in the long run¬†¬ª I really have no idea how this would be possible.

[See my post on GME and other stocks from yesterday which was very successfully buried and received little attention.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m35u61/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th/)

**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**

So far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.

In Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%! Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85... LOL

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwx447sfjtm61.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e718f52e50d2819d41bc226f160d0f2d00562b8c

Since then

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fbroivvgjtm61.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459319c3ad0b896088e1b73b0e1520543769a979

On March 1st and 2nd the shorts got side-lined by a bunch of WSB interest and the price spiked +71% to $43.

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers. (youtube links not allowed)

So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!

They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:

On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.

**This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgtiqziljtm61.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3979f04d5b95acb8b0a097642ff84bbfe185e553

Data from here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.

[Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)

From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967

The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.

During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8yr8b5njtm61.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55b9cbcddae79869becb78017a1832a6b4dfeda

Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.

The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

**That's about a 300% return from current price.**

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qelq19cpjtm61.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1177d9ce4e4baf2b65056ad52ef14f108b1c7da4

**TLDR:**

RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

This is literally our chance to start being the change we want to see in the country and the world.

Trickle down economics doesn't work because you have to water the roots, and this is going to be our job.
