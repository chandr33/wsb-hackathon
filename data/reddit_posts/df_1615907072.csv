9,m6b4rp,"Im getting sick of seeing all comments downvoted in the daily GME threads. Dont let them manipulate people here in losing hope and paper handing! 

I made a script which you can counter the downvote bots with. It doesnt downvote your already upvoted comments.

Press f12, and a console opens. Paste this in your console and press enter:

&gt;var a = document.querySelectorAll('\[aria-label=""upvote""\]\[aria-pressed!=""true""\]');  
for (var i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {  
a\[i\].click();  
console.log('upvoted: ' + i);  
}

You can scroll down and load more comments. If you dont see the console logging items anymore, execute the script again.

Also I dont know **if it is spam**. If so **please tell me and i delete this** haha. But i cant see any rule about this as being spam. The reddit rules are dont use a bot to upvote things, but this doesnt make use of the api. Its purely what the user can do with their own web browser and whats provided from reddit itself. So its not a bot :)

Also, thanks for allowing me to learn a lot about trading these few weeks. Im new, and i dont think there would be a better time to start trading than now, with all you retarded helpful people. Thank you.

Chinese electric car maker Nio plans to enter European markets from the second half of 2021, CEO William Li said at an online conference on Thursday. He also announced the company’s intention to enter other international markets from 2022.

Analysts suggest that Norway may be the first European market for Nio. The company is quoted on the NYSE, and its stock price is currently at about $43. Nomura analysts predict that it will jump to over $80 within the next few months, if it continues to meet delivery targets.

51,m6b9kd,"Hello fellow Apes, long time lurker here. The last couple of months I've been reading and researching a **lot** on investing and the current GME situation. And I can't be the only one. This is the effect of the January GME run, now I know all about the HF's dirty tricks. Today they borrowed 1.5 **MILLION** ETF shares to short. That's right, after all this, they are shorting this thing even more. The price isn't dropping because apes are selling, because we are not. They are causing the price to drop in a desperate attempt to make us sell. But guess what? 

**I AM NOT SELLING.**

It all comes down to something as simple as that. **I DECIDE WHEN I SELL.** By shorting the stock even more they are digging their graves even deeper. I'm not selling my GME stocks for $1,000, nor $10,000, nor $100,000. My stocks are worth so much more than that. So selling them for $170 or whatever the current price is would be pretty fucking stupid. All I have to do is.... nothing. Just hold.

Peter Rawlinson, the CEO of Lucid, was once a big name at  $TSLA and therefore has the know-how when it comes to building up an EV company and what to look out for or how to improve what he has seen at Tesla.

74,m6bdfp,"I remember when I got back into the stock market a few months ago after I swore I’d never return. I got burned twice and didn’t think it was worth it at all. It wasn’t until after seeing my first WSB post of some guy who made 4 million on tesla calls that I thought, dude that can me be. I didn’t even know what a call was and the thought that people can actually make 100x  baggers tickled my sack and I was reinvigorated to learn how I can be that guy. 

Throughout my trial by fire, I learned along the way by making and losing some money. Preparing my self for my “moment”. I decided GME was my moment, along with a lot of you retards. I rode this mother fucker from 40 to 475 and back to 40.

Want to know what the ONLY thing that kept me going was ? I kept asking my self, in the most introspective way imaginable, would I actually have the balls like that tesla guy ? When I was leaning to trade, I had a certain mentality.

“Man, if I had that conviction, and had that trade in my lap, I’d do it in a heartbeat. I’d  hold my shit for years. If I knew about tesla I’d so have diamond handed like that dude!!”

Now I ask myself, would I actually ? He probably held through many dips, lots of FUD, and a plethora of attacks saying that his investment was retarded (not the good kind). Would I have survived that? Would I have had what it takes to be the envy of this community and all others? 

This is what keeps me holding. I’m proving it to my self that yes I CAN be THAT dude. That dude that others give praise to for having a hammer dick After his trade prints. 

I won’t get into all the reasons why, as many of you are already aware: but everyday I see more reasons to become more diamond handed. 

And like one of the top rated comments I saw on that tesla post - remember..
