tldr;

Don't panic. Hodl. Buy the dip. Expect fuckery today and tomorrow.

Fake a sell-off to trigger a real one or at least shake off some retail traders.

\----

If I were a hedgie 🤮,

I would have the following in mind regarding what retail is paying attention to:

* Short utilization is at 100%
* Borrow rate is up around 14%
* Price is going up
* SSR might be triggered making it harder to drive the price down from shorting
* The 2020 Q4 earnings report comes out today at 8 p.m. eastern time.

What do I need to do to scare them?

* drop utilization rate
* drop borrow rate
* drop the price
* trigger SSR and still drop the price to imply that it's legit selling and not more shorting
* make it seem like people are dumping because of the earnings report. Make the earnings and company performance and outlook the scapegoat.

How do I do it?

* accumulate shares slowly to try and not make the price go up too much
* return some of the shares I shorted with some of the ones I just bought so that utilization rate and borrow rate go down
* flood the market with supply to drive the price down
* stop before SSR and let the price recover a little bit
* short the shares I just returned to drive the price down. Might need to sell some of the shares I recently bought too, but ideally, I can just short and save those for the next step.
* Trigger SSR, so now retail thinks shorts can't drive the price down that much
* Flood the market with more shares from the ammo of shares I recently bought and keep shorting to create sell walls to stop price in its tracks.
* Do so strategically to make it look like a ""normal"" panic sell.

What a shame that big money can do shit like this and hide market manipulation under the disguise of normal trading.",Hedgies are acting very predictably. Don't panic. What I suspect is their strategy is... (Context of AMC but likely applies to GME),1.0,1615401638,jtree5757

This time, we have proof. At 12:41 (20 mins after GME /AMC started dropping like crazy), CNBC posted this article [www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/10/gamestop-surges-40percent-then-wipes-out-gain-completely-and-is-halted-again.html](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/10/gamestop-surges-40percent-then-wipes-out-gain-completely-and-is-halted-again.html)

This means that they wrote an entire article with citations and quotations, got it reviewed, got it approved, and got it published in 20 minutes ? Nope, they knew this was going to happen and published it to add to the fire after the hedge funds told them so. We all knew that CNBC was dogcrap but the timing of it is definitive proof that they are collaborating with hedge funds and that this whole attack was planned.

36,m250cg,"Ok here are my thoughts  


1. Shorters keep count of the stopp losses (sell orders active)
2. Shorters use algorithms to see when a trigger will have sufficient impact to cause a drop
3. Shorters sell a large amount and trigger all these losses, causing a spiral
4. We recover, which they do not fucking see coming

Could shorters have this amount of sell power?
