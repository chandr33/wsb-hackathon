13,m4xrz7,"# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?

\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Fundamental Constraint

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s9uystsmn0n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=612d845bce1686629bd7aa7d2bedef5028891ba9

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It‚Äôs going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

&amp;#x200B;

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you‚Äôre able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pms84rvhpvm61.png?width=2073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11914ae63ebcb5a662e9c623e7caf558382539e5

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

https://preview.redd.it/3wqso7bkovm61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e922d828b2fb5655e4ce433e6bfcf05f5ff891

&amp;#x200B;

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

https://preview.redd.it/b83hyt7yl0n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf497fa79d6162b868fac37c54aed27f13efbdf8

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

\- Cash App‚Äôs Twitter and advertising strategy

https://preview.redd.it/1qvo71pmm0n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca7632db9415950320744b438310aba1518a105

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjm7d1fpm0n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8604ba6d3b892c789c2a3d8a615ed2dd38b31cb4

\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching ‚ÄúCash App vs. Venmo‚Äù. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nl52ye7ym0n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632d7f0b5043f169520fdb1af54bc3c8a3080322

&amp;#x200B;

[Chicago's North vs. South Sides](https://preview.redd.it/r3l5dtm7n0n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d7b39081a3229ef0d163dc5bba00a2d861eeb7)

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square‚Äôs youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You‚Äôve heard it before, ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?‚Äù. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

What this inevitably means is that we probably won‚Äôt even see Square operating at ‚Äúfull-force‚Äù until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank‚Äôs regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.
7. Square will improved loan systems.
8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

I believe in doing good with our new found tendies and I‚Äôll say it now that WHEN GME hits 1000/share I‚Äôll adopt 10 gorillas and post proof on here. But until then the goal remains the same.

97,m4y8t0," I am extremely proud of this community, if all the people in the world were united for a single cause and we fought against the system (hedge) we would be a better place, we are making history and we will do it.  I am happy for the fact that they are adopting gorillas, but there are also some other animals, which are almost extinct, there are only 25,000 polar bears left in the world, I know that the bear means down trend, but it is for the cause, we are everyone here for the cause and obviously the money. We will not let ourselves be won, united we are and we will be better humans. V",Adopting Apes! Together we stronk! Polar bears,0.94,1615739054,CurrencyCheap
