IT’S THE MOST SHORTED STOCK RIGHT NOW

https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today

To the moon we go 🚀🚀🚀

PREVIOUS DD:

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌

9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

APR 1 PT: $150

P.S. Do your patriotic duty and save the malls

96,lwyb27,"From Saturday's Wall Street Journal article on AMC:  


""As the (AMC) stock rocketed the next day, day traders exhorted each other not to sell, flashing images of diamond hands on social media to signify the strength of their commitment. But back among AMC's long-standing investor base of Wall Street players, there was money to be made. Silver Lake, which held a $600 million investment in the company's bonds, immediately capitalized on the rally by converting the debt into equity and liquidating its entire position, capturing a $113 million profit.""  


When I read this I was really pissed, until I read on and saw what it meant for AMC . . .  


""Silver Lake's quick decision amounted to a material gain for AMC. 'It was immediately beneficial...cause we got rid of $600 million of debt,' Mr. Aron said.""  


""Mr. Mahmoodzagedan, AMC's investment banker, said, 'The retail investor (that's you beautiful smoothbrained retards)  clearly had more faith in the long-term viability of this company than a lot of the institutional investors did.' That, he said 'gave the company a major life-line. The retail investor really helped create that bridge to a post-pandemic future.'""  


Remember this for when they haul you in front of a Senate Inquiry like they did DFV. ""We save American companies. Wall Street short sellers destroy them. I am not a cat. I am the savior of American businesses.""",Retail investors care more for the success of American businesses than Wall Street,0.97,1614789884,OrderingTacos
