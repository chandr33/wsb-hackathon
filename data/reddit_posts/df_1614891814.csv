When you have consistent momentum of Call Buying in large batches it is really referred as UOA, [Unusual Option Activity](https://www.warriortrading.com/unusual-options-activity/). Some people &amp; shops made business out of it like these [folks(from CNBC)](https://marketrebellion.com/members/getting-started-uoa/).

Other than this stock is trading in very tight channel of 100-150, which only tells us that each time selling pressure comes up either our apes brother come with buying or market makers are buying it.

Upcoming Catalyst for GME is yet not confirmed earning on 25 March, where people are expecting big announcement may be about Cr#\*to or [Ryan Cohen Ice Cream cone](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lwlb6m/slgg_possible_connection_to_gme/). Point is either the expectation of catalyst of actual catalyst will catapult this stock to new highs.

Now back to today's UOA activity, where some ape bought 1300 Calls for 16 Million Dollar approx. now people might say it could be spread, sure may be but I don't see it here.

66,lxvjxv,"You've probably heard the news by now that 6 Dr Seuss books will no longer be published for imagery that has been deemed racist. Regardless of your political beliefs, we're all here to make MONEY. Basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases. Sure enough, within two days, these banned Dr Seuss books are now worth their weight in [fucking gold](https://www.cbr.com/dr-seuss-banned-books-sell-high-pries-seconday-market/).

Here's a breakdown by numbers. I'm using data from Barnes and Noble online to establish the normal hardcover price, and then the lowest price on Amazon to establish approximate selling price after it was announced that they will no longer be published:

* The Cat's Quizzer
   * $9.99 ---&gt; $499.99 **(4,905% increase)**
* If I Ran the Zoo
   * $17.99 ---&gt; $594.00 **(3,202% increase)**
* On Beyond Zebra
   * $16.99 ---&gt; $425.25 **(2,403% increase)**
* Scrambled Eggs Super
   * $14.75 ---&gt; $325.00 **(2,103% increase)**
* McElligot's Pool
   * $19.99 ---&gt; $325.00 **(1,526% increase)**
* And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street
   * $16.99 ---&gt; $224.25 **(1,220% increase)**

Every single one of these is a literal ten-bagger. What's even more crazy is that this [Insider article](https://www.insider.com/classic-childrens-books-that-havent-aged-well-2019-5#if-i-ran-the-zoo-by-theodor-seuss-geisel-aka-dr-seuss-has-been-criticized-for-containing-numerous-offensive-images-1) sort of called it almost two years ago‚Äîthe first book on their list is If I Ran the Zoo. In addition to the above mentioned Insider article, I looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content. My analysis leads me to believe that *The Indian in the Cupboard* by Lynne Reid Banks, currently being published by Harper Collins, is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze. Here's why:

1. **Low Search Volume**. Here's a Google trends graph of how often the recalled Dr Seuss books were searched for on Amazon. 

https://preview.redd.it/d178buhtl2l61.png?width=2322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad443bc373d439abe34e87d8fbd8c8d04ffd32a

Notice how there's nobody trying to buy these books? This makes sense. No publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular children's book. This is why books like *The Cat in the Hat* or *Peter Pan*, which have also been criticized, will never go out of print. It would be a financial nightmare.

In contrast, look at how Indian in the Cupboard stacks up against some other contenders:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1xe9dbpun2l61.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e3995810de807ae599684cd690ba7efc2149b7

If you follow the red trendline, you will see that searches for ""Indian in the Cupboard Amazon"" are effectively 0 with some slight upticks every now and then. This contrasts with Amazon searches for titles like Little House on the Prairie, which sees consistent search frequency. Discontinuing further printings of The Indian in the Cupboard will probably have little impact on HarperCollins' margins.

2. **Broad readership base, particularly among middle-aged readers.** In addition to being discontinued, a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge. This will happen only if the book has a broad readership base. In Dr Seuss's case, so many adults have probably read at least one of the 6 discontinued books growing up (hell I loved Mulberry Street when I was little), which is why they're actually buying up these books now that they've become limited edition items. It probably helps that Dr Seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills.

Similarly, *The Indian in the Cupboard* was actually well-received in the 80s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide. You can still find entire teaching guides built around *The Indian in the Cupboard*, and I distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade 2009. Yeah, this book isn't as popular as it once was, but I'm willing to bet that in the 40 years that it's been out, it's been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned. This also gives *The Indian in the Cupboard* an advantage over books like *Pippi Longstocking,* which‚Äîdespite being a children's book with low search volume‚Äîis beloved in Sweden but has a much smaller audience in America.

3. **History of contentious debate.** The controversy over Dr Seuss's books didn't just happen overnight (although it certainly felt that way). His books have been banned in libraries for years and there are [arguments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/reckoning-dr-seuss-racist-imagery-has-been-years-making-n1259330) going all the way back to the 90s about whether his books are racist. This is the same situation that *The Indian in the Cupboard* finds itself in. It's been removed from numerous public libraries and the American Library Association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as 1991. This is important because the decision to remove books is typically time-sensitive. Given almost 30 years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing, Harper Collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences, especially under the current political climate, to decide that they will stop further publications of *The Indian in The Cupboard*. 

It's important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks. However, books are still less volatile and, like art pieces, tend to appreciate in value over time. I think that *The Indian in the Cupboard* is a long-term hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from circulation.",Banned/Discontinued Book Investing,0.91,1614892316,Polytroposphere
