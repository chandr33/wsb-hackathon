19,m2uais,"I see a lot of posts asking what short selling is so i tried to explain it with an simple example.

You have 50‚Ç¨ on your bank account.
Your friend just bought the new FIFA2021 game.
Then he decides to borrow it to you for 3 Months because he doesn't needs the game at the Moment. 
You take take the game and say thank you and give him a litte gift and promise him to give it back in 3 Months.

Then you take the game and sell it for 50‚Ç¨ on Ebay because you think the price for the game will decrease over time because Fifa is a game which will be bought less over Time because there will (or maybe already is) a better game (Fifa2022) soon.
You now have 100‚Ç¨ on your bank account.
After 2¬Ω Months you buy the game back for 30‚Ç¨
You now have 70‚Ç¨ on your bank account. You made 20‚Ç¨ Profit.

This is short selling explained in a very easy way.

Lets go back to the scenario when you sold the game.

Suddenly a lot of people start buying the game. Maybe something makes the games special (maybe a printing mistake on the cover) or some random people in the internet say: lets buy every existing FIFA2021 game.
The price for the game starts rising. 
60‚Ç¨
80‚Ç¨
95‚Ç¨
You see that and think: Shit I have to buy the game now otherwise it may be possible that I can't give back the game in 3 Months I only have 100‚Ç¨. 
So you buy the game for 95‚Ç¨ in order to be able to give back the game.
Because you just bought the game the Price increases to 100‚Ç¨ which causes that the next dude who sold the game of his friend has to buy the game. The price will increase till everyone who sold a game which he doesn't own bought one back. 

You now have 5‚Ç¨ on your bank account. You have lost 45‚Ç¨ and the people who sold the game on ebay made 45‚Ç¨ if they bought the game for 50‚Ç¨

This is a short squeeze explained in a very easy way.

Metaphors explained:

FIFA2021=Highly shorted Stocks like GME
You = Companies like Melvin Captial
Your friend = People who borrow Stocks to other companies.
eBay = The Stock exchange
Something that makes the game special = E.g. a new groundbreaking announcement from a company 
Some random people in the internet = r/wsb

20,m2uavm,"Tonight there is a major speech from Biden and I think cannabis legalization is mentioned driving up the price of cannabis stocks specifically MSOS I have 3/19 4/16 6/18 9/17 calls for MSOS on the cannabis legalization trade. Mostly 55s and 60s OTM strikes at different dates stated above. 

I‚Äôm betting on a these key points for my long thesis on US PURE Cannabis ETF $MSOS:

Consumer adoption: People love weed and the use  of cannabis is increasing as it becomes legally accessible. not just current users but future users. Old people love it in Florida. Younger consumers are choosing instead of alcohol and it‚Äôs healthier than drinking or tobacco. 

Legalization: I‚Äôm bullish on full legalization but even partial is incredibly good, I think tonight we get a legalization comment like SAFE banking or medical legalization. Biden might be anti in the past but he has shown he is doing things a little different these days. New blood in the DEMs will push this line. 

280 and NYSE Uplist: the financials are really fucked up and these stocks have fundamental strength. If your not an accountant or a finance person than your gonna be confused but basically the government fucks legal companies in cannabis through draconian tax policies for money laundering and the lack of liquidity by being stuck on the OTC with strong balance sheets and strong sales. Once this gets fixed it‚Äôs like 2x returns easy: I‚Äôm looking at long dated calls but they are expensive and only reach out a year.  No long term options past early 2022. 

Growth: the growth in cannabis is wild and profitability is insane, seriously if you have capital you can make a fortune in the sector.

Generational opportunity: this is like alcohol and gambling and other opportunities that are obvious. You just need to seize that opportunity. The rocket ship is getting some gas and could take off any day. 

I‚Äôm long MSOS and the underlying GTBIG TRSSF AYRWF IIPR as well as MSOS calls at 3/19 4/16 6/18 9/17

What makes them special? The deals they are signing in the Chinese fintech space.

One of the most undervalued fintech plays available. Extremely explosive financial growth. Estimating 50 million in revenues for last year and we are eagerly awaiting their forward projections/guidance (subject to major deals being signed) for this year. Our group estimates revenues will scale to a bare minimum of $200 million.

They are signing massive deals with Chinese distributors, entire Cities (city lending hub model)and building verticals left right and centre. 

I could do a really long winded DD post but I encourage you simply to read the news releases going back to say quarter 3 of last year.

Once you recognize what the company is doing, and how effectively they are doing it... it‚Äôs a unicorn.

My personal price target is $30 by end of year. Nasdaq incoming very soon followed by financials. They are making bank. CEO has discussed dividends as early as next year. This guy has executed on every promise to date. Never seen anything like it.

# What happened to short interest?

It's gone. The short sellers did cover most of their positions. I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.

# So GME is fuk?

**Not at all.** There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging. He's calling it a ""gamma swarm"" and it works like this:

# Call sellers are going short, but not for long

When you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised. That's it. If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.

But what if it goes up? Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract. With American calls this can happen at any time. With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date. That's the gamble when you sell call options.

Big players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.** That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares. This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract. Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell üöÄ calls to ü¶ç (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left. So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.

# How long do they wait?

For GME? 1-5 minutes. That's wild.

# How does this impact GME?

At the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10. That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.

Now, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares. Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares. So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.

# So, ultimately, what's happening?

The author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:

""\[T\]he Reddit‚Äôs r/wallstreetbets is said to have **9.4 million members.** If even a fraction of them coordinate their efforts, they can overrun the market""

""This leverage has changed the game. It will be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I‚Äôm not sure they even know yet what power they have.""

""\[T\]his new surge suggests that other companies with different shareholding profiles could be vulnerable. Factors such as size or liquidity could be important.¬†We probably don't know yet what the risk factors are.""

""With the ‚ÄúGamma swarms‚Äù the process has suddenly become violent. The ‚ÄúGamestonk‚Äù rout accomplished *in three hours* what it took the engineers of the legendary Volkwagen short squeeze *three long years* to execute.""

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest news coming out of the call is how, ""absolutely"" BULLISH the CEO is about AMC's future and the Key actions that the Team has put in place to move it forward.

Key Takeaways:

* Raised $2.2B in Cash.  Operating cash will last easily into next year based on their very conservative estimates.
* Negotiated $1.6B in creditor and land lord concessions.  This is a big deal and will significantly impact cash burn.
* 90% of U.S. locations now open.  New York has been a BIG success and their biggest market Southern California, including the critical L.A. DMA, is expected to open as soon as a few days from now.  
* Pent up demand is huge based on their research and what they experienced with the New York reopening.
* Over 40 major movie releases, including block busters like Top Gun 2, that were held back in 2020 are now in que to be released in 2021.  This in itself will drive box office.
* Vaccinations have taken off and AMC is leading the industry on operating standards for safety and cleanliness.

The bottom line is the Company is now a MUCH safer long term play.  Remember AMC is the class of the industry to begin with.
