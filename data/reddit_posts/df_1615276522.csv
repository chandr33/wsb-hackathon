This shitty advice, but proper documented, will not be long. 
The hedgefunds are abusively manipulating the price rise of the stonks starting last week and probably the first days after the stimulus reaches your account to make you wanna join the retard apes‚Äô club of fighting the hedges. 

The hedges need to cover their shit and they wanna try it by using US GOV stimulus (individuals‚Äô money) for fake rise of the stocks. Once you get the stimulus dont throw them at high prices of the stocks. Wait for a real, market regulated, dip process. Hedges are trying to squeeze your money at high prices. Look at the month of february, the did it the same!

They are artificially rising the stonks, making you believe the are on a pattern of getting to the moon!

For the apes having stonks, and holding diamond hands, you are doing the good thing, but remember what #DFV did, he sold stonks at the highest, waited for the market regulated dip, and bought...again. And he will do the same, soon! If you feel comfortable to sell, do that, do at your own recognizance

I was questioning myself if I should invest in GME but I haven't invested in stocks or anything my whole life.

I'm not here to ask you if I should invest or not, I'm here to ask you what's up with GME? How is it going up continously? Like, it's a great thing but how does it keep increasing its price up to hundreds of dollars?

I lived under a rock and I couldn't figure anything out from news and articles and now I'm trying to figure it out, that's all. If somebody can explain me what's happening, something like a TL;DR, that would be much appreciated.
