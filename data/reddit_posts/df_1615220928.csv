# I am not an investment advisor, due your own due diligence..

# I love flier biotech plays, because when they work, they really work. In my opinion you will either lose 50% of your money in the next three weeks, or 2-10X your money. 

# SUMMARY

* The market is severely underestimating the potential for Annovis Bio, Inc. (‚Äú$ANVS‚Äù) to release positive Phase II interim Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs data in the next month, (data release has been stated to occur March 2021) and the explosive rerating in valuation that would follow. $ANVS is a little followed clinical stage biotech company that is taking a novel approach to degenerative brain diseases, by experimenting with a drug that enhances the flow of messaging along the information nerve pathway, as opposed to simply attacking plaque build ups. We will know within the next month whether this novel approach works, and if it does, I expect this company to rapidly achieve a $1B+ valuation. The float of shares net of insiders is miniscule at &lt;4M, further amplifying the potential for an explosive rerating.  In a market in which some companies that are effectively highschool science projects with powerpoint presentations are achieving multi-billion valuations, a real company, with a real drug, and a decent shot on goal of showing good data in one of the most sought after indications in medicine ‚Äì  is simply a good risk/reward at a \~$170M market cap. 
* A comparable company with a similar drug is Cassava Biosciences (‚Äú$SAVA‚Äù) that went from a $50M market cap to a $1.94B market cap in the last two years, on an N=50 patient data set, with less stringent trial design, less promising data, and a drug with fewer targets, i.e less platform capability. In fact, the $SAVA study was open label, meaning both the patients and researchers knew what drug they were taking ‚Äì and based on positive biomarkers the stock soared 133% on the data release. In contrast, the $ANVS impending Phase II data is a double-blind placebo-controlled study at highly reputable research institutes, including Columbia University, UCLA, and UCSD ‚Äì meaning the quality of the data, whether positive or negative, is simply better. I think this is a great risk reward scenario: if the data is bad, $ANVS will drop 50-70%. If the data is even remotely promising, $ANVS will rerate 2-10X. 
* The CEO Maria Maccecchini is a trained scientist, not an MBA, with a PhD in biochemistry from the Biocenter of Basel, and is a respected expert on neurodegenerative diseases. Ms. Maccecchini has stated that $ANVS will raise money in 1H 2021. Given that the stock is +\~400% in the last two months, and the company has chosen to wait to raise money until after the data, arguably this is a positive indicator for the impending data. 

&amp;#x200B;

  

# THESIS

* In simple terms, $ANVS‚Äôs drug ANVS-401 (also known as Posiphen) could be a game changer for neurodegenerative diseases. For the last 20 years, pharma has looked primarily at one neurotoxic protein, beta-amyloid, which causes plaque. More recently companies started looking at another toxic protein, tau, which causes protein tangles in neurons, and finally some companies have looked at alpha synuclein, which causes lewy bodies ‚Äì all of these are essentially forms of plaque build-up/unwanted bodies that inhibit information transmission and cause nerve cell death. $ANVS has conducted proof of concept (‚ÄúPOC‚Äù) studies and safety studies (prior to the Phase II ANVS-401 trial) that show a statistically significant decrease in these three different proteins, and is the *only* company with a drug that may inhibit all three of these toxic proteins. While this POC was on a human data set of only five (5) patients, this data comes on the back of incredibly promising  animal studies. $ANVS only needs to replicate the POC data below in their Phase II preliminary data, for the stock to see enormous upside. 

&amp;#x200B;

* In addition to the new focus away from simply beta-amyloid based treatments towards other mechanism of reducing toxic protein build up in neurodegenerative diseases, the regulatory landscape has changed recently in that the FDA has indicated that they may approve an Alzheimer‚Äôs drug with less than stellar trial results. 5.8 million people in the US and 44 million people worldwide are estimated to suffer from Alzheimer‚Äôs, and total costs of care for people with Alzheimer‚Äôs and other dementias is estimated to top $1.1 trillion by 2050. With the PDUFA delay in [$BIIB](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BIIB&amp;src=cashtag_click)‚Äôs aducanumab despite the drugs failure to meet endpoints, the FDA is indicating that they want more Alzheimer‚Äôs drugs on the market, even if they fail a Phase III study. The market for these drugs is so large that many blockbusters can coexist and may work synergistically with each other. Even if a drug shows a modest efficacy improvement over placebo, the market should now consider the FDA‚Äôs willingness to look at less than stellar data with possible approval in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

  

WHY $ANVS IS UNDERVALUED/MISUNDERSTOOD:

Drug development for AD/PD is exceptionally difficult ‚Äì in general, neurology and psychiatry are minefields for data. Five drugs are approved for the treatment of AD including four cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine). No new treatments have been approved for AD since 2003. While these drugs ameliorate the symptoms, the ultimate goal and perhaps *the* current largest unmet need in medicine is the development of disease modifying therapies (DMT) that stop or slow the progression of AD.

$ANVS licensed three compounds from La Jolla-based TorreyPines Therapeutics ‚Äî posiphen, phenserine, and bisnorcymcerine ‚Äî that had demonstrated a potential for treating cognitive impairment. Phenserine is a compound that Axonyx (‚Äú$axyx‚Äù) brought through to Phase III human trials, however In March 2005, Axonyx suspended patient recruitment for the ongoing phase III trials of phenserine, after the drug failed to meet the primary endpoints of the first of these trials. The results of earlier trials appeared to show a difference between phenserine 15mg and placebo on levels of bad proteins. The phase III phenserine failure indicated that the magnitude of the difference between control and placebo and the variability of the data showed that a larger investigation would be needed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect ‚Äì or that phenserine simply does not work. 

$ANVS is not developing phenserine, it is developing the enantiomer of phenserine; posiphen.  In layman terms, enantiomers are molecules that are mirror images of each other (shown as either + or -- ), however they can (and usually do have) very different mechanisms of action and physiological effects. Both phenserine and posiphen were developed at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Phenserine was developed for the purpose of making a better acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), similar to Aricept but better than the existing four classes of approved cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine). Posiphen was developed essentially as enantiomer afterthought, as the focus was on AChEI inhibitors. Axonyx, Inc. licensed phenserine from NIH and developed it as an AChEI through three Phase III studies that all failed. Even though a potent AChEI, phenserine caused severe vomiting, and did not meet primary endpoints in Phase III. The (‚Äì) enantiomers including phenserine are symptomatic AChEIs, whereas the (+) enantiomers including posiphen (ANVS-401) have no AChEI activity and data thus far indicates they may inhibit the translation of neurotoxic proteins, such as APP/Ab, tau/p-tau and aSYN and protect nerve cells from dying. 

In the words of CEO Dr. Maccechinni, on $ANVS licensing posiphen, phenserine, and bisnorcymcerine:  

‚ÄúSomehow the idea spread that I was developing the one that had failed in phase-III testing because that was the most advanced of the three,‚Äù Maccecchini said. ‚ÄúI canned that one (phenserine) instantaneously. I don‚Äôt believe in resuscitating dead drugs. But people don‚Äôt ask. They don‚Äôt check. It made it hard to raise money.‚Äù

$ANVS believes that ANVS-401 -- a small, once a day, orally administered, brain penetrant inhibitor of neurotoxic proteins -- has the potential to be the first drug to interfere with the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration. The biological activity of ANVS-401 has been evaluated in 19 animal studies conducted in leading institutions such as the Karolinska Institute, Columbia University and Harvard University. $ANVS has conducted three clinical trials with 125 humans, including two safety studies in 120 healthy volunteers and a proof-of-concept study in five MCI patients with Parexel, an international clinical research organization. All data thus far has shown ANVS-401 to be well tolerated, with promising clinical signals: posiphen reduced and normalized the levels of APP, tau and aSYN back to the levels seen in healthy volunteers and statistically lowered inflammation.

The study ([https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524351?term=posiphen&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524351?term=posiphen&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1)) will measure data from 12+ different biomarkers and 5 different efficacy endpoints. Showing efficacy on any small number of these biomarkers or endpoints we believe would lead to a repricing. Quite simply, $ANVS is an underfollowed, unloved biotech, that faced a steep uphill battle due to the public believing that its drug is simply a phenserine redo. Some of the best opportunities/mispricing‚Äôs in biotech are companies with seemingly sketchy management but good clinical data ($IMMU, or $NVAX), or companies with drugs that are misunderstood, or considered to have already failed. At a \~$170M market cap, the market is pricing in a slim to zero percent chance that $ANVS hits primary endpoints. Even assuming posiphen will fail future phase III trials, showing efficacy in this phase II study is a much lower hurdle.

I'm a proud Doordash üåàüêª

While my wife wasn't surprised, her boyfriend obviously had questions. So I made this DD, and I figured I'd share it with my fellow tards to help confirm your bias. 

March 9th there will be an early unlock of shares that will significantly increase the float a significant amount. I believe that the dramatic increase in selling pressure may just break the stock and run the stock price to levels below its IPO price. 

You may be saying, ""but absurdismism, I work for doordash and make over $9 a day, it's the best company ever!"" Let me start by saying, I don't care.  Even if you think that delivering Wendy's is a breakthrough innovation, my thesis is for the near term has little to do with valuation. 

Of the over 110 million shares eligible for sale starting March 9th, 95,709,974 of them are Class A shares held by former holders of convertible preferred stock. I would venture to guess you smooth brains aren't the type to buy convertible preferred stock, so maybe you have no idea what that means and what type of investor buys them.

Hint: it's the type that doesn't just sit and hold a bunch of common on hopes of cap app. They typically sell asap after conversion.

The sellers are coming. The sellers are so far in profits that the rush to the exit may just be spectacular. You can watch it will tears of regret or tears of joy.

Okay okay lemme start by saying I love this sub. I found this place when I was very low and losing a lot of money. Very depressed and truthfully felt like noone understood how I actually view all this shit. GET MONEY. I love the freedom it allows us to post shit talk and throw ideas out there for other like minded retards to give their own uneducated opinions. Now simply put that is what this is. I am a retard.

Okay so who remembers soft banks options report i believe in July 2020? Who remembers that the rally from March 2020 lows was basically started by way otm calls on essentially everything. 

Now the hype here has been all GME for awhile now. Meanwhile there are about 40 other stocks that are tracking with GME. Now my retarded ass finds this a little sus right? Not to mention the radical swings and volume. It all seems to coordinated and happens way to quick, and the amounts being traded I hate to break it to you guys but that‚Äôs not retail moving it. Retail cannot and won‚Äôt ever have the capabilities to move markets like how we are seeing. 

Where my mind goes.... destabilizing a countries economy is literally the first step to taking their asses over. Markets have been moving in unbelievable fashion and against just about every analyst out there.

What if I told you there is a way to train computers to gamma mine? 
what if I also said 90% of market movements are algo driven? 
What if I told you that we were warned in the past about technology ruining civilization? 

And yet here we all stand holding our bananas and completely going along with outside forces
Please everybody remember to take your profits when you can. While is little guys are getting stoked about 10-20-100k even 50 mill for DFV remember almost a billion was lost just a week and a half ago. I mean I gained so I‚Äôm not
Complaining but I know for damn sure WSB didn‚Äôt make no billion a week and a half ago. 

Don‚Äôt get fucked guys. Remember the ones who make the laws and control this country are the very people GME(along with the others) have been going up against for 3 months. I do not see this ending well and ultimately see the sec finding evidence that points to massive market manipulations.

Just for Clarity if you didn‚Äôt remember the beginning I love this sub Reddit and can‚Äôt imagine where my mental sanity would be had I not ever found you guys.  I do not in anyway believe the retail investors of Reddit are the ones truly driving this. 

I have never felt more sure about anything in life other than these two things. 

1) GAMESTOP WILL BE SQUEEZED 
2) the consequences of the squeeze if it works out to be the moass will probably hobble the country for a very very long time.

As I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm watching GME surge along with well everything else that Reddit claimed. Please guys make the best decisions for you your family and your future. Remember to take a minute and think about all the consequences if this does happen. 

Sold out all my positions last week most at a loss. Had GME 150c and pltr 24.5c along with small shares in pretty much all the memes. Please don‚Äôt bash my post and downvote me because of my craziness. I really wanted to get this off my mind it‚Äôs been fucking me up for 3 months and I share this with the same community that brought me from a bad spot in my life.pleas remember I am in no way insinuating this market action is coordinated by Reddit, really it‚Äôs the opposite I believe Reddit is being targeted as the reason why the economy will fail.

For those not giving a hoot about technicals, that's fine, but you will notice it did a perfect 38.2% retrace from $194 -&gt; $164. 

With all the hedgies jumping in, it was always expected price movement would normalize. It is in fact the big players that create 'the normal'. 

This should also serve as a bit of tonic to those concerned by the drop from 194 to 164.",Fibonacci retrace and target,1.0,1615221683,Citor3_Official
