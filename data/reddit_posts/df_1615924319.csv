[FOMC Playbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m568xl/simplified_fomc_playbook_for_smooth_brains/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So since Sunday night, a few things have changed regarding FOMC predictions. 

Throughout yesterday and today, I’ve been seeing more articles and interviews from big banks and institutions regarding their predictions. This has changed my views on the likely hood of each of the 4 possible plays from the playbook.

From these interviews, I’ve read and watched each one carefully. From what I’ve dissected, I believe that, what was the play that I thought was least likely to happen, is now most likely to happen. That play is #4 on the TLDR, which is the Federal Reserve will not install YCC measures, and will also not extend the SLR suspension.

My reasoning behind this is the fact that there’s a revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC/Federal Reserve. The big banks have contacts at both the SEC and the Federal Reserve, who fill them in on information regarding policy changes. Usually, it’s someone who left that bank and went to a high level position at the SEC or Federal Reserve. 

**What’s important is that a lot of the interviews with big banks predict that the Federal Reserve will more than likely welcome the rising yields tomorrow.**

Welcoming rising yields backs the idea that they won’t implement more YCC than they’re already doing, to suppress the yields from rising. It also backs the idea that they also won’t extend the SLR tomorrow, which will cause yields to rise, as big banks sell off their treasuries. You might say, they still could rise with the SLR suspension extended, like what’s happening now, which is what I go into in my next two paragraphs.

As you know from my FOMC Playbook post, I was betting on yields rising by buying weekly puts on TLT and ITB, while hedging my positions with VNQ calls in case yields fell after FOMC. I was watching TLT like a hawk today, because it tracks the 20 year auction that happened today. It was on the downtrend and then instantly skyrocketed a few minutes after the auction began, signaling the auction was doing well. I was a little salty, because even though that’ll make my hedge position profit enough to still end green as a whole this week, it wouldn’t profit as much as if the yields crashed. 

But then a couple minutes after TLT mooned, it crashed back down to where it was. I think this is big banks trying to sell off their treasuries before they lose a lot of value from the yields rise after FOMC tomorrow.

I used a discussion flair for this post, rather than DD, because I’d like to know what you all think about my thesis. Feel free to leave feedback. I had got into TLT and ITB at insanely low IV, but after I made my post Sunday night, the IV rose quite a bit. I haven’t checked it lately, so I don’t know if it’s still lucrative enough to still buy options. But hey, y’all buy options on meme stocks when the IV is 500%+, so and IV of 40% is probably a gold mine to y’all.

C3 AI is a fraud. I am from AI industry, it’s not a AI company. They changed their name from C3 energy to C3 IOT to C3.ai to fool dumb investor who don’t understand AI.

This stock in not worth $30, the C3 to leaders and [Insiders ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c3-ai-inc-ai-ceo-031501653.html) already “Sell” on this stock at $80  . My advice exit before you loose 50% from here in next 3 months.

For intelligent readers here is why C3 is not a Datadog or Snowflake

&amp;#x200B;

* C3 is not a product company, it doesn’t have a rockstart product like Snowflake and Datadog . It uses AWS/Azure cloud to deliver most of it’s services with it’s staff sitting in California. So the margin is very thin and it can’t compete for long with well entraced services companies like Accenture, Cognizant etc..
* C3 customer base is not Unicorn next generation startups growing 50% but outdated companies which are discovering that they should use technology. So it builds a custom product for each of it’s customer which is not repeatable or salable to other customers as the customer paid for the project
* The business model is not subscription based. So, deal like a service company is closed with manpower and material cost and maintenance at the end. 

Always remember C3 is not a AI company, it is not a Product company and it caters to companies which have no growth.

Where do I think GME is going? That's simple.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ofwpleyz3gn61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf5bc2abc0c55e2e887395f4c765b847e5684dca

I want to send a special thank you to the Alpha Apes in the sub! You know who you are, and what you have done. You guys are the reason the 90% of the people come back here every day. I love reading all of your DD regardless of any predictions or non-confirmation bias, because I know what went into putting it all together.

We, the public, only have certain information available to us at any given time. The fact that you can extrapolate real theories and factual data from the publicly available cache is incredible. I will continue to read your valuable thoughts and form my own opinion, which will help me decide what I want to do with MY OWN MONEY (buy and hold obviously).

With all of that said, here is the reason for my post. We, the public, have precious few real facts to go on. The information we get from the institutions is old, incomplete, fraudulent or flat out non-existent. The only things that we know for sure are as follows:

1.) The hedgies have shorted GME.

2.) The total float of available shares vastly outnumbers the actual available shares.

3.) There are synthetic shares in circulation.

4.) There is a lot of artificial and negative press the further this goes on.

5.) There are a lot of Bots and/or Shills spreading FUD.

6.) DFV is a hero!

7.) The Alpha Apes who put their blood, sweat and tears into helping us, are heroes!

8.) Even though the hedgies did a very stupid thing, they have very intelligent people working for them. They have vast resources and many legal and illegal options at their disposal.

9.) We the retailers have Whales and other institutions on our side to a certain extent.

10.) Those whales and other institutions are not in this fight for the retailers, but are in this to make massive tendies for themselves.

11.) This is a big one. If a person was to buy GME shares, and then held said shares, he/she would indeed have diamond hands. This in turn would force a person in a short position to have trouble finding the needed shares to cover their position. Theoretically, the value of the unobtainable shares would then grow. As that value increased, it would start to take the shape of a massive rocket. If said diamond handed warrior were to continue holding his/hers unobtainable shares, the rocket would appear to lift off in the direction of the moon.

Lastly, I’m no expert, but if this theoretical diamond handed warrior did exist, he/she would surely tell you to HODL, and buy the dips.

This is not financial advice, blah blah blah....

56,m6i0xa,"Today I'm going to tell you THE REAL REASON why the HFs are using short ladder attacks. Guess what, it isn't to kill momentum or make people lose faith in the stock! They are doing it simply to increase implied volatility and make options less attractive.


For the smooth brains:

When a stock jumps up and down, it increases something called IMPLIED VOLATILITY or IV. When you go to buy options, this is priced into the cost of the option. If a stock can move by a lot, it makes options contracts MORE EXPENSIVE and LESS ATTRACTIVE.

Not only do ladder attacks lower the share price temporarily which might trigger things like stop losses and drive confidence in the stock DOWN, it hits both of your holes like the ultimate shocker - because it ALSO drives IV through the roof.

What happens when IV goes through the roof? Retards can't spend $1400 on 50 $800C weeklies with the hopes of a big payout, because they are TOO EXPENSIVE. This GRINDS THE GAMMA SQUEEZE to a HALT, and the stock price slowly drops or trades sideways until the volatility settles enough for the average retail moron to be able to afford tons of options contracts again.

We saw this when the stock settled at $40 for a while. As soon as the IV dropped enough where options were attractive again, the stock popped again.

What we are seeing now is the same... if it trades flat for a week or two and the IV plummets - those $400C are going to look like a PRETTY TEMPTING GAMBLE.

When that happens, the options volume is going to skyrocket again - causing the market makers to buy shares to write contracts, and we will see another wild ride.

Here is my DD:

I expect the price to settle, maybe at $180... Maybe at $150... Maybe at $207, but we are going to see a FLAT scenario for a while until another spark lights the fuse and people jump all over those newly reduced price calls and the cycle will happen all over again.",Let me give you retards some financial education because i see a lot of money flying around and you should be informed.,1.0,1615925062,heapsp

84,m6i552,"Shalom fellow autists,

Broke student ape here from the Canadian Jungle. I cobbled together all the buttons and strings (bugs and sticks?) I could find to invest in GME and so far have 2 whole shares lolol. Waiting for my trading app to take more bank transfers (fuck that is infuriating waiting for my own money) in order to yolo my sad dollwhores.

My question is, beyond sticking it to the hedgies in some infinitesimal contribution, there is no *real* point in such a small investment right? Might what? Get a small scalar multiple of my dough to a whopping fraction of a crumb of a tendie? I bought in the dips yesterday and today (although I missed the sweet sweet low this morning :'(  oh well). Paid 227 and 212 I think, but transfer that to CAD.

The Hodl is strong with this one, and I *am* attempting to ""increase"" my  position however meagerly, I have a limit buy for 205 I hope goes thru before market close today. Guess I'm looking for support more than advice idk, and hoping these corrupt suits keep kicking the can for a few days so I can still buy in low when another 1k deposits into my trading app.

Love being a part of this shrewdness of apes, just wondering how small-time participation can be cast?",Advice for Broke Ape,1.0,1615925363,AlienNoble
