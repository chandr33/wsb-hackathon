TL;DR Rocket Labs is actually going to the moon, confirmed. [I shit you not.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/)

If you didn‚Äôt read into the news, company deck and analysis out there, here is the important shit.

**TAM**

* Forecasted to be 1.4T in 2030
* Space is the next frontier, unforeseen TAM expansion

I know your smooth brains can't even predict where you'll wake up tomorrow morning, but this is like trying to forecast how big the internet was going to be in Stanford's basement.

**Backers**

* Solid names like Lockeed and Blackrock. When you say Blackrock and Rocket in the same sentence, you know it's game over
* Auntie Cathie is probably eye balling this company hard, probably trying to come up with excuses on why it should be added to each ETF
* SpaceX only allowed 69 investors in for the last raise, people are hungry to throw money at it. The line to get in is longer than the unemployment line. Where do you go when you can't get in?

**Revenue growth**

* Easily beat 2021 forecast, already 90% booked, this is straight out of their pitch deck. Yes, companies lie, but go look at [this man's face](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/), would he lie to you?
* Government (not just US) space spending will increasing YoY. Biden wants to leave a mark, and not the kind of shit on the backwall of his toilet bowl.
* Space Startups increasing YoY, and everyone needs a ride to orbit. This is like 2 am when the club closes, everyone wants an Uber but there ain't enough drivers. RL's launches are already booked out.
* Satellites as a service is a new business model, making it accessible for a lot more companies, already picking up traction. Ryan Cohen with his own GME satellites? Hell, this sub can probably pool together for WBS satellite.

**CEO**

* Does actual rocket engineering like Elon, you don't want some bean counter.
* Guy is a genius, multiple records and awards, [he has actually sat on a rocket and set a land speed record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-29/at-18-he-strapped-a-rocket-engine-to-his-bike-now-he-s-taking-on-spacex)
* Elon has is a busy man, he's looking after 4 different companies. This is Peter's only focus.
* Let's be honest, better accent, and bigger belly. This is good.

**Moat**

* Vertically integrated entire Rocket and Satellite manufacturing process. They make their own shit.
* Already becoming a supplier for component ingredients. They supply people their shit.
* Patents build up of 3D printed rocket engine designs, battery integration, etc. Had me at 3D printing.
* Private, government back launch sites dedicated to RL. This is the new hot real estate.

**Brand**

* Proven track record. They've launched 97 Rockets to date, this is more than 69 for those of you that can't count.
* Multiple government contracts, NASA level shit
* Elon tweets @ em, we all know what Elon's tweets can do
* Their logo is a üöÄ

**Competition**

* Only 2 companies consistently making it to orbit: SpaceX and RL
* SpaceX dead set focused on Mars colony with Starship, (retired F1, likely F9). RL will happily take that piece of the pie. RL is going to the Moon [and Venus](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html). To me, we're are going to another fuckin planet, don't care which one.
* Everyone else either is showing no results, and/or struggling with failures, delays and change in management. Rockets are hard, who knew, even Bezos' Blue Origin is laggin.

**Short term catalysts**

* Moon mission is going to going to make waves, but I don't need to tell you that.
* ARK will add, just a question of for how many ETFs.
* Look, they can do up to 120 launches a year, the viewership for these launches are trending up, the only different is, there will now be a stock ticker watermarked to screen. This is GME billboards on steroids.",Rocket Labs DD - Found the company that actually makes Rockets,1.0,1614727373,BIGJAYsmalljay

**Agriculture Aerial drones** 

First of all this isn‚Äôt necessary financial DD just something to get people thinking who may not know about the Agriculture sector

So‚Ä¶ Automation it Is coming into absolutely every single industry in some way or form, one thing often oven looked by people is the Agriculture sector. Farming these days isn‚Äôt just about throwing some seeds into the ground and hoping for the best, its about Precision farming. 

There‚Äôs 3 main aspects of precision farming that‚Äôs relevant to drones;

* ¬∑ mapping/data
* ¬∑ general spraying (think whole fields) 
* ¬∑ spot spraying (targeting ie weed patch in the middle of a field)

But im going to be more talking about why companies regarding general spraying are worth taking a look at while there relatively cheap. This is coming from the perspective of a farmer and is the general view in the UK agriculture community.

&amp;#x200B;

**Breaking down spraying operating**

So its important to know the current costs of conventual vs drone spraying. With the FFA (USA) and the CAA (not fully rolled out but is slowly) (UK) allowing and starting to promote the use of drones for spraying its something that over the coming years will be a natural progression for farmers.

The applicants/ferts are NOT taken into account as they will be the same though out the board and vary from crop and location.

What this table shows. Breaks down 3 options 

* 1. DJI AGRA T20 (yes I know I know not a publicly traded company but is good for a case study)
* 2. A used sprayer  
* 3. A brand new John deere sprayer.

The fixed parameters that are relevant are;

* ¬∑ Fuel ¬£0.50/L
* ¬∑ Labour ¬£8
* ¬∑ Drone hours halved (assumed they‚Äôll be working on a pre mapped basis may even be less hours)

(apologies you'll have to zoom)

*Processing img gxn12sic8pk61...*

So to break this down for a 900Ha (2223 acre) farm yearly the difference between even a used sprayer and a DJI drone is ¬£10,842 alone which is pretty much a return on the initial purchase in a year‚Ä¶. 

Now for a farmer that‚Äôs a lot, and if they can save that much money on operating alone then it‚Äôs a natural progression and choice, especially with the lower cost a lot of famers have the view of ‚Äúits worth a go‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall view of 98%ish farmers I‚Äôve spoken to**

* ¬∑ Less/cheaper to maintain.
* ¬∑ Relatedly disposable (cost- drone vs sprayer)
* ¬∑ Manage multiple from an office (fleet operations/contracting) etc 
* ¬∑ Solar panels are becoming cheaper so almost no running cost
* ¬∑ More versatile, can be used for crop monitoring/data collection (so don‚Äôt need to leave the office!)
* ¬∑ More effective work rate then humans

&amp;#x200B;

**Companies I think are showing potential** 

¬∑ **Actual drone manufactures**

* o $DFLY - Draganfly inc
* o $UAVS ‚Äì AgEagle Arial systems 
* o $AVAV ‚Äì AreoViroment inc

¬∑ **Component parts** 

* o $AMBA ‚Äì Ambarella (yes I know they‚Äôve had there ups and downs)
* o $TRMB ‚Äì Trimble (not only in drone mapping but also becoming more used in conventional precision Ag)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Like I said not DD or technical analysis, but I think a lot of you who are maybe thinking about automation and are into longer term plays may have been interested in hearing from a farmers perspective but also the cost of operation drones VS conventional fleets.

Overall drones more so on the spraying basis have a humongous potential, from an operating cost perspective alone it allows a more streamlined and cheaper operation. With the cost of the equipment alone even DJI‚Äôs drone at 10k roughly which is deemed as the premium of the market is penny‚Äôs in the world of agriculture equipment. Yes they have smaller capacity but with a higher work rate, cheaper operation its by the by. 

If there are another people interested I can go into a more technical analysis of this all but unsure of how many people are interested in Agriculture here. 

**TLDR**  
 Agriculture spraying drones have a potential massive upside and future in the market based of the operating/purchase costs alone. Most farmers atlest In the UK are keen to transition from conventional spraying equipment to drones for a multitude of reasons.

Currently the stock price for Merck is relatively low (compared to how it was a year ago) and has dropped quite a bit in the past year. In light of the news, this stock has the potential to start rising once again, however it could also continue to drop. I am curious to hear what you all have to say about  MRK. Do you think the current stock price is a steal, or do you think it'll keep dropping? Let me know what your predictions are.",Thoughts on $MRK?
