Ok, I bought 10 contracts DBX 3/19 c28 for $1.45. They're currently up ~900% at $14.40, but still not ITM with 5 days to go. DBX has been on a tear lately, up about 15% this week, so there's a possibility it could move up another two dollars next week, and be ITM. If it stays flat I'm gonna get extra theta loss over the weekend.

So have you apes done in similar situations? Taken the big return on a Friday, or risked it for the last 5 days of the contract? I know this comes down to risk tolerance, but I'm curious if anyone's been in a similar situation, and how it's worked out.",Holding short options over the weekend,1.0,1615570111,The--scientist

I'm sure I'm not the only person to say this but I'm very pleased with the current trend of 5/10% increase a day. That's a good increase for days in which literally no news is coming out. I take it as meaning that the who is in the stock genuinely likes it and sees a good future for Gamestop. I certainly do.  Think of it like a videogame where the number of users is slowly increasing and everytime an update is released a new set of people come in to stay.  I'm very excited about upcoming company announcements and can't wait to see the direction they're taking and being invested just increases that feeling of participation.  Sure, maybe what I'm writing sounds like emotional hogwash but regardless of short squeezes, temporary price increases or decreases, etc. I really think that with even a reasonable P/E ratio the price of the stock is going up even further and by a lot. That's my take but I'm not the only one.

88,m3mrud,"Hi, I just wanted to discuss something with you guys about gambling and the difference between gambling and making a smart educated decision. I want people who maybe are new to this to not loose that savings money their mom got them just to “hold on to”. 

Diamonds are worthless but hold value because of controlled supply, gold is steady and smart and rare. Diamond Hands bad, Golden Hands good.

I tripled my investment in a couple days. Why? Because I didn’t listen to emotions on a subreddit, why? Because I have Golden Hands. Why? I observed the trends and knew when to get out by selling at the magic 300 number after buying at 110. 

A lot of these people on these forums want you and as many people as they can to hold on to a certain stock just so they can sell out at a reasonable price. It crashed, why? Because all the big guys, the whales knew to sell at around 300. 

Their “paper hands” turned into cold hard cash, paper as in franklyns i might add. 

Sure some of you are emotional about this subreddit and say “love you guys” at the end of your post thinking with your heart when we need to think with our dicks in this market. Your balls.
And for the lady out there somewhere same thing. 

Sure some of you bought at 260 and are praying it will go up to 500 (unlikely but possible) so you can turn your $26,000 into $50,000 to double your money. That is best case scenario. I mean, it could also go down to 100 dollars a share again when you could “just buy more!” How are you going to just “buy more” when you just put your whole life savings into a meme stonk and “diamond hands” it untill you only have 20% of your life savings left and it’s all in fuckin VideogameStop!!!?

At one point the games need to stop, at this point it’s just gambling. And as your holding the bag for some rich asshole 26 year old with a 6 figure investment making a logical GME day trade, he sells, and so do all his friends and your left with nothing, hoping you will double your 10k that you already blew when you could have just put it in freakin Tesla or Apple or BRK or some shit and been fine. 

get the moon, but be smart kids is all I’m saying, some people get in real trouble over this shit. Just think how many parents are pissed at their kids right now for loosing thousands of their money on a bad GME trade as the parent forced them to sell it and the kid cries “noo i gotta have diamond hands!!” Parent doesn’t know wtf they are talking about pissed about loosing half their money.",Golden Hands 🙌 and how I tripled my money during the second GME bubble 🙌,1.0,1615570892,Bidipabeebop
