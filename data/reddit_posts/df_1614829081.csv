Take everything about GME on here with a grain of salt, and make decisions on your investments based on your own assessment/analysis. With that said, did an ape-level trend comparison of the current price trend with the trend from the short squeeze. There are certainly many variables that have changed significantly since then. Whichever direction the stock wants to go from here, I just think it's hilarious how similar they appear to me.

If the trends diverge in the future, let this post be an example of confirmation bias!

First, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.

I see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.

If we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.

I see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.

First, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.

Even they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .

Then let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.

I didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.

So, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.

Please correct me if I have any mistakes.

Position, 104@110

EDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   💎💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.

62,lxc3fb,"Hello Fellas, 

I’m sure most of you have had your focus on taxes, GME, RKT, AMC or whatever else which is highly respectable works. I’ve been a lurker here since around Fall of 2020 If i’m correct and have finally decided to spread a good cause.

Today, I come to write up a storm about how Ocugen is still undervalued, not in wants of a meme moment but in want of true investors who are willing to learn more about this very promising company and reap staggering rewards.

Earlier this morning Ocugen’s partner for a COVID-19 Vaccine, Bharat Biotech released their “Interim Phase III Data” in other words the effectiveness to their vaccine. Coming in at %81 it surpassed Johnson &amp; Johnson measly %66. Although markets have been awfully red me and the other $OCGN believers saw a massive premarket volume topping off at 10AM (45% Gain) But me and many others alike are not simply looking to day trade this stock or swing it...

Ocugen's Covaxin focuses on preventing COVID-19, not reducing hospitalizations. This is far superior to 
$NVAX, $JNJ and others. It also works just as effectively against the mutant variants. Pretty Powerful.

The news of Phase III Data was not suppose to drop for a week or so, but it came as a surprise today. Unluckily the shorts did bleed the ever living fuck out of Ocugen today while market sentiment was lower.

Personally I missed out on the gains from February but I am sticking to this stock because it is the only one that I truly believe in. Very enticing PR is right around the corner. OCGN/Bharat Biotech intend on getting EUA + FDA Approval this same month.

The fact that OCGN still finished green today when almost everything else in their sector was red as well as every index, says something. 

You could argue that the top of Ocugen has already been met at $18 a few weeks back... Though let us not forget that the ticker only saw a $2 Gain on its news of a vaccine partnership, and two days later rocketed to $18. I surely believe something very similar can most definitely happen this week.

India, France, and Brazil are onboard as well. Ocugen is based in Pennsylvania for any wondering and has had people on the case to push this out ASAP. 

Covaxin is cheaper, making its way toward children testing, the Indian Prime Minister took this days before any Phase III results were published.

Nevertheless, OCGN is not only a COVID play that has massive upside potential but also a leader in treating blindness. OCU400 is a drug they’ve manufactured to regain sight in the blind or restoring clarity in eyes. 
Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ocugen-stock-buy-now-know-173301134.html - “We believe the latest news further boosts the likelihood of COVAXIN receiving approval in the US,” the 5-star analyst said.
