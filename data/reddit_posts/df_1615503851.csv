17,m33e9g,"Just a reminder to those out there being a part of this rollercoaster of an exciting time in economic history, try not to get too emotional. Do not let the highest highs and lowest lows consume you, stay in control. Many of those involved with $GME we’re burnt out after the initial chaos. In some ways they we’re lucky to recover an ounce of dopamine during the consolidation phase in Feb. But things are volatile once again (arguably also more defined) and the apes have something to live for once again. But understand the big players have vast resources to extend this course of history beyond what our feelings and intuitions can handle. Since the advent of the industrialized nation, that has always been the last yet most effective weapon in the arsenal of the powers that be - time. 

Admittedly, this ape doesn’t know much about stocks, but I do understand power. I can assure you they will drag this out in manners that DDs or financial experts cannot fully predict, within the market itself and from institutions outside of it. Prospect of tendies will be watered down and doubt will be sowed in the media and the mind of our ungrateful wives. Retail investors in $GME are playing a game of leverage with the Masters of Leveraging. And in this moment, it would seem the power of the many is outweighing the power of the few. Because of this, the rest of the world is rooting for you behind closed doors.

For now, victory may be afoot, hope seems high and many can already taste the gourmet green crayons on their lips. But please remember that no matter your motivation, whether it be financial gain, payback, revolutionary cause, or pure retardation, please do yourself and the stOnK a favor by beginning the process of accepting that you are playing the long(ish) game and it could be weeks or months before you will finally get your dirty opposable thumbs on those earned tendies. And by god will we all have earned them all. 
If you begin to question the reason you started investing in GME in the coming weeks/months, you will fold and so will the stock. Many will be mocked, broken, homeless, divorced, suicidal, unemployed, and inconsolable. But the same person can also decide to beat their chest, nut the fuck up, continue to go about their life and hold no matter how scary the dips are - those same people will be praised, stable, prosperous, engaged, content, and most of all full blown retarded. 
Which way it goes depends on the decisions you make from now until then. During that time, many events will unfold undoubtedly... but you bet your sweet monkey ass I’ll still like the stock.

51,m33idv,"The majority of shares are held by real estate agents within the company but they don’t know they have a diamond. They are either unknowingly HODLers or paper handers.

*The business model is cloud based real estate brokerage.*

- no brick and mortar overhead

- as the number of agents goes up the cost of doing business on cloud per user goes down.

- they are several years ahead of Zillow in the brokerage space ( zillow just anounced its brokerage this year and Exp has ripened in maturity this year)
- the real estate market is 🔥 and IMO will continue to rally

- the agents are doubling in size YOY which equals LOTS of TENDIES for exp

- unlike Keller Williams which incentivizes agents to recruit others and make money from the fees which agents pay monthly, EXP is not an MLM, exp allows agents to make money only if their recruits close transactions which in turn makes agents more prone to helping new recruits succeed.

- exp owns virbela which is a virtual office space that has grown around 70% in users in past year, and IMO here to stay

- exp is going global: US, Canada, UK, Mexico, Brazil, Portugal, South Africa, India, etc, and the list is growing (more tendies for exp)

- ROE is solid at 30% (human-capital driven success)

- And “I like the stock” - DFV

- The financials are lit and today they shouldn’t let me down today

- low short percentage
