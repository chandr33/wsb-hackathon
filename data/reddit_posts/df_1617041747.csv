5,mfvuam,"On February first one of my seven little Apes told me about GME. I had an old IRA and got Mama Silverbacks okay and yolo’d it on GME.
Today I had a conversation with MS about continuing a monthly amount to ADD to the mix to help it grow and she was totally on board.
So today my perspective changed from needing the price to go up to hoping it stays where it is until Wednesday when I can buy some more! And hoping it dips on the first of every month after that!
I have been waiting my whole life to be a part of something like this, when Main Street stands up to Wall Street. I gave little Ape much love for getting me involved. Apes Together  Strong..... I love that, to DFV and all the apes holding strong. I told little Ape I will always, until I die hold shares of GME. Long after the squeeze that may or may not come, long after the hoopla is gone I will be holding shares. Yes, I hope there are major tendies along the way for me, but the fact that Hedge funds are going down and wealth is being transferred back to the retail investor is enough for me.
Naked shorting should be stopped. And maybe the DTCC sending the SEC guidelines that require Hedge funds to account for their positions on a daily basis is the first step in that happening. Maybe not, but I hope so!
If you are still reading thank you, to the posters on WSB that have made me laugh out loud for the last two months thank you! To the generous nature of the donations WSB has/is making for great causes, thank you, the world needs more of you!
Apes Together Strong, I’m so happy to join you! I’ll be holding and adding with you Apes! Hopefully to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀

6,mfvulv,"Millionaire maker Stock: Drone Delivery Canada!

In Canada alone, 150K routes have been identified with their partner Air Canada Cargo.  Clearly they are a longggg way from that currently.  However, that is one country and does not begin to accurately quantify DDC's ultimate potential.  So, here is the simple math.  This is in $US.

150,000 routes X $15,000 per month = $2.25Billion per month or $27Billion a year.

Now clearly DDC is nowhere close to that.  So, let's start small and build:

100 routes X $15,000 per month = $1.5M per month or $18M a year
1,000 routes X $15,000 per month = $15M per month or $180M a year
10,000 routes X $15,000 per month = $150M per month or $1.8B a year
25,000 routes X $15,000 per month = $375M per month or $4.5B a year

Now let's talk valuation. At each of the number of routes above I have assigned a revenue-multiple based on routes and maturity of the company. Valuation multiples are as follows:

100 routes = 100 X revenue
1,000 routes = 50 X revenue
10,000 routes = 20 X revenue
25,000 routes = 10 X revenue

Now let's translate to company valuation i.e. market cap (revenue X multiple = company valuation/mkt cap):

100 routes = $1.8B company value
1,000 routes = $9B company value
10,000 routes = $36B company value
25,000 routes = $45B company value

Now let's translate to share price at each of those levels.  (company value/210M shares)

100 routes = $8.57 share price
1,000 routes = $42.85 share price
10,000 routes = $171.43 share price
25,000 routes = $214.28 share price

Financing needs will likely result in an increased share count, so the share prices at 1,000 routes and above may need to be discounted based on future dilution. But, it should be noted that as share price increases the diluted share requirement decreases.  For example: At 1k routes, if the share price is $42, the company could raise $1Billion by selling only an additional 23million shares. So, the point is, dilution is not exponential. 

So, with respect to the industry, are drones coming?  Yes
Is DDC positioned as a leader and potentially ""the leader"" in the space? Yes

When their is turbulence in the market, it can be easy to lose perspective.  This loss is what ultimately leads to market capitulation i.e. weak-minded investors selling off shares that sophisticated investors buy at a huge discount. 

This is not investment advice.  It is simply presented for the purpose of perspective.  DDC still has to execute. *got this from another chat. Thanks to that person who originally posted it.",Drone Delivery Canada,1.0,1617041945,Secret-Preference723

51,mfwa9n,"ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th).

At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let’s do some digging. 

From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx)

*Why invest in ARKX*

*Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.*

*The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.*

**why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as “cash-like” for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. 

Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). 

The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). 

Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies).

**39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that’s actually the first thing I’ve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. 

**only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, 🚀 Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). 

**their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it’s absolutely needed for space tech whether it’s printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. 

**actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings (excluding USD) have current revenue and financial stability as opposed to negative FCF for the next few years to come (last 2 holdings). Again a sign of lowered risks taken given the current equities market. 

**TLDR**: while initially underwhelming ARKX composition could very well be increased and even reshuffled as market conditions normalize (and/or market crash). Doesn’t look like very spacey nor ultra innovative right now but it feels like Cathie Wood hasn’t shown her hand yet. 

Not a recommendation to buy, hold nor sell any securities. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 because it’s space + WSB.",ARKX Holdings Early Thoughts 🚀🛰🛸,1.0,1617043119,Rivaaal

The DTCC has released new rules that essentially will split the bill with hedges and clearing houses etc. Now even the NSCC is trying to put out rules to split their bill too. The NSCC new rulings are set for 4/21. Time is running out for the companies to cover losses, THE DTCC, NSCC and more.

Why?

Mid March they found out the entire market is a fucking ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The US govt literally handed free money to hedges to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. That was the hedges job during the virus. Now on the 31st coming up that money is gone, no more, the rule is expiring and they won't be funded anymore. (Unless extended)

Who are they?

The DTCC is essentially the worlds largest bank give or take handling over 90% of all existing US money. They are the only people who receive ALL MARKET DATA meaning they don't have to guess about anything they have every bit of info they need on these hedges positions.

Why would they do this?

There's massive upside for many many stocks bc of the amount of free money pumped into hedges during the pandemic. This of course went to shorting an absolutely shit ton of stocks as we all know. Then the stimulus checks have essentially pumped more money into the hands of individuals then there has ever been before. This combined with the hedges free money disappearing the 31st can cause massive damage to the DTCC possibly for more than they are willing to depart with.

How do we know hedges are in danger?

Tiger LLC and Goldman Sachs have both been 'margin called' and liquidated over 10B dollars in assets for underlying hedges. This margin call on Goldman is ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGIN CALLS IN HISTORY. Tiger and Goldman both had high stakes in Chinese companies and US Media networks. For an example of what liquidation does to a stock refer yourself to VIACOM the price has drop over 50% in days due to liquidating positions. (Possible Distraction?)

What does it all mean?

IMO we've managed to scare the largest bank in the world, THE DTCC, they see their wellbeing at risk and are acting as fast as possible to split the bill with as many people as possible before shit really hits the fan and stocks like AMC/GME have INNNSAAAANE UPSIDE POTENTIAL come to be realized.

TLDR: THE DTCC IS FUCKING TERRIFIED OF US APES. The little guys are winning my friends. This can mean insane upside for AMC among other stocks.",Hedges Are Fucked. AMC GO BRRRR.,1.0,1617043798,OptionsBabi

73,mfwk3u,"Dear Hedge Funds,

I sit here and wonder how many great companies that went to the wayside because you decided their value wasn’t relevant anymore.... Toy ‘r’ Us or even before KB toys are a couple that comes to mind that were relevant too me... I spent many hours dreaming of what I would get when my mother took me. Coming from a single mom family those trips were important to me and my childhood. As I grew up and moved out I still visited those store for my video games (mind you this was before GameStop I know I’m showing my age) and as I had a son I began those same special trips for him.... those stores are no more so are those feelings and the memories begin to fade until things like this happens. 

  Now my mom sits 61 years old and don’t know who I am anymore the Alzheimer’s has taken a toll on her right when it was time for her to relax and begin to enjoy her life. I tried to explain to her what all was going on and that I had yolo’d my life into a cause bigger than myself. I actually got a response from her the biggest smile I haven’t seen in the last few years so I took it that she understands and she told me to Hold....

 As I sit with a bunch of Mad Ape and think of all the things your robbed of the little guys over the years of the memories you ripped away. I can’t help but to be proud...  For once your about to get what’s coming to you and it’s not the hate for you or the blood that we want. But it’s the hopes and the dreams we want for our family so as we snatch those back penny by penny Day by Day if that’s what it takes we’re not leaving we’re not selling we stand tall and proud Apes too stupid to know better other than that. So enjoy the days the weeks the months you have left at some point you will crush to the extreme pressure the pack of Apes beating on your door is causing...
Or you could just toss in the towel and start the bleed pay out what you owe and hope that you have a funds left to live without the worry of how your gonna pay this months rent or car payment or the babysitter for while your at work ect.... those same pressures we’ve lived with for years the choice is yours at this point

To buy a put option on GME for Jan 21, 2022 at strike price $250, it only costs a premium of about $150. Is this interpretation correct? What is the max cost? That scares me.
