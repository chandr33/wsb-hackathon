11,m2exbz,"GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED app buddies, 

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**.  The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.   

**The Hedgefunds**                                                                                                                 Today, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the SSR (short sale restriction)** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say ""if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?""* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**                                                                                                                                                                                                              

**The Media**                                                                                                                          The media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME  and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our ""MEME STOCKS"" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**

**The Crayon Eaters**                                                                                          Foremost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**                                                                                                     

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

 Fuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it  made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**

GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED app buddies,

Now I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard.

What I don't understand is how you'll know the difference between the hedge funds buying 7 billion of shares versus getting mislead that its another pump from reddit people.


Do hedge funds need to disclose when they start buying like a big ceo? I don't want this to sound like I'm on their side.   It's just I never see talking about how this should finish.   There's a war right now and I want WSB to win.   But I also don't want everyone blinded by the battle and lose sight if the real reason why this is happening.   To  make sure we stick it to the big guy.   

Please feel free to shit on me and maybe there's something I'm missing.  But by at least if you shit on me some good info can come out of it so everyone can keep rallying to the right point.  My biggest fear is an a average joe mistakes the last pump and it's hedge fund pump and then the bottom falls out underneath them.   We need to win, when it's all said and done.

üöÄ  Roblox is widely viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of COVID-19 as lock-down orders, school shut-downs, and parents dealing with their young children 7 days a week permeated the world. The data supports this as Daily Active Users (DAU) doubled on a YoY basis in a short timeframe. Roblox provides 3D virtual world experiences to over 36M DAUs.
During the pandemic, growth exploded and ~75% of children aged 9 to 12 use the platform. To continue its growth, Roblox is adding events to capture additional users and hours spent on the platform.


üöÄ


üöÄüöÄ One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.


üöÄ


üöÄüöÄüöÄ  Roblox isn't your traditional developer or publisher of video games nor is it a video gaming company as the business model combines gaming and social. Roblox fits the Andreessen Horowitz model as it can be free and it's widely available across gaming consoles, PCs, and even mobile (iOS and Android) and, more importantly, friends can play together across different platforms. From a business model sense, Roblox is a platform company that has a network effect, the more users who engage with the platform will, in turn, invite their friends. From a ""social"" point of view, Roblox users spend 2.5X more time on Roblox than YouTube. 


 üöÄ


üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ On the other side of the platform are developers who create ""experiences"" (or games) for the players and, in 2019, developers created over 20M experiences. The key, however, is that Roblox provides the tools for developers to create a game and, more importantly, as players get older, some develop games on Roblox. Monetization occurs when some users buy Robux to pay developers for an experience or virtual items for their avatar. In essence, there are two self-reinforcing network effects occurring where more players will invite their friends who will become players and more players on Roblox will create more developers to create additional content..


üöÄ


üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ In some ways, the business model is similar to eBay's (EBAY) business model as eBay created a platform to connect sellers with buyers and sellers pay eBay to list their goods. The difference with Roblox is that not all players buy Robux and, rather than Roblox taking 100% of Robux's sales, Roblox takes a percentage of Robux sales as its fee. However, do not be fooled that Roblox may take only a ""small fee"" as it is estimated that the fees that Roblox charge its developers are in excess of 70% (Adopt Me!: The most popular game you've never played) and while Roblox may take at least 70%, for those who purchase Robux via the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, fees to those platforms, i.e. Google and Apple, are 30%.

Hey apes,

**I know today for some of us was still a +7% day, and for others, it was an ""uh oh I am freaking out"" kinda day.** So I have been looking in the Mega-Thread and I stumbled upon a comment about a GME analysis! **I watched a few of this guy's videos and I have to say I am impressed. He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**

**It won't let me link the vid, Idk why but lookup:**

 GME Stock - FUNDS ENTERING - BULLISH OUTPERFORMANCE - GameStop Prediction for Tomorrow, March 11th 

Rember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.

1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.
2. **We are still up $10\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!
3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!
4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???

TL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.

92,m2fcrp,"'Autists' first my disclaimer. Red Crowns taste better than green but have double the calories. I also know nothing about investing, stocks, stonks, or Elon Musk. 

I am guessing you are all aware of this anyway. But I would not be the grey-haired diamond hands ape if I did not give you my opinion. 

Lunchtime I was strapped in with a goldfish bowl on my head ready for the moon. The launch was a most splendid thing as 'GME' left the atmosphere. Then like Mr potato head, the trip was canceled. 

(I hope the moderators allow me to post this else I will be so sad. Even sadder than my wives, boyfriends, dog who I am no longer allowed to walk since I invested the profits from my condo in GameStop stock. What can I say I like angry pussy)

So I noticed the vertical plummet back to earth. How could they be manipulating the price so efficiently I thought to myself. Like an honorary retard I stuffed the green crowns in my mouth and began to chew nervously. Yes, it was happening again. My AMC stock had the exact same pattern. 

I'm a newbie to all of this so I would not have a clue to find out about AMC but I can use google. So I discovered what most of you already are aware of. Two companies are the majority shareholders of 'GME'. 'B.R.' and 'V' have enough shares to influence the value of the stock so violently.  But why on earth would they attack their fellow hedgies. By the trend (the wiggly crayon lines) they dumped almost all their stocks and then repurchased on the dip. Standard stuff from what my mom told me when she read the more complicated posts to me from the WBS threads. 

Canabals? Why would they be trying to hurt the hedgies so? Then I thought hang on a minute. 

&amp;#x200B;

WBS is getting all the market credit for this war. I would guess the hedgies are crying in their pillows tonight afraid of the months remaining days. Ohh yes, young Jedis uncle Biden may not be able to remember the name of that five-pointed building thingy but he can sure sign checks. 

'B.R.' and 'V' won't qualify for the $1400 else things would get real chalky fast. But for those of you who were fortunate enough to read the small print on these mothership investors they kind of read like the UN script. You will own nothing and you will eat crayons and you will love it. 

While this would be a dream come true for most of us the hedgies planned on belonging to the elite club. But how can the world hit the reset button if the hedgies are still robbing our beloved meme stocks? In a nutshell, they have to be eliminated. But if the motherships ended them the fallout would be horrific. Epstein Island would no longer be a vacation paradise for them. 

So they need some heroic 'autists' to take the blame. Diamond-handed ones. Even let a few of them gain significant drawing tools that require thumbs. Maybe those fortunate few even end up investigated by a few corrupt branches of the tree that is of white. 

Not sure how this affects each and everyone's uniquely abstract opinion of strategic crayon stacking but I thought you might like to know.  

As for me, all I have left to say is I am Sparta the orange crown. I will be on the field of battle tomorrow regardless. Hitting the post button with my knuckles now moderator. Send this pray and message to those who need it.

Pardon my retardness, but I just want to buy this stock more, with more discount!

Ever since the first mooning of GME in the cold of January, I have been playing a game called Super Mega Baseball 2. When GME tanked after I bought in at 293, I needed an outlet to occupy my time and get away from the red. So I made a team called the GME Retail Sparrows and entered season mode. 

We started the season 3-2 when GME was in the trenches in the mid 40s. We went on a 15 GAME WIN STREAK and low and be-fucking-hold GME shot up to the 120-130 range. We just won our last 4 in a row, although the last game came down to a walk off in the bottom of the 9th from my girl R Horne. That explains today's sell off and narrow gain on the day (narrow I say üôÑ, 7%).

Currently in the top of the first I am up 3-0, 2/3 of my first hitters hitting homeruns. Premarket tomorrow will be green as fuck. 

This is not financial advice.
