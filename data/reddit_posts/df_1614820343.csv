48,lx9d65,"Yet another day, TSLA and tech stocks got crushed due to rise in Yields. I feel this is an over reaction because the 10-yr bond yields are just at where they were pre-covid. I outline below why there won't be any rise in the short term interest rates atleast till the end of 2023 and why stonks will go up

**Unemployment claims and inflation** 

Unemployement rate in January was 6.3% and the Fed's natural rate of unemployement stands at around 4%. The Fed has cited that if we were to include millions of people who quit the labor force and other misclassifactions the rate could go up to 10%. So, even though we are reopening there is a very high rate of unemployement across the country.

In Feb 2020, US had the lowest unemployement in it's history at 3.5% and guess what the inflation number was ? less than 2%.

**Effect of stimmy and infrastructure package**

There is around $1.9 trillion stimulus package on the way and plan for a $2 trillion infrastructure package later. If both of them were to get through (I doubt the infrastrucure deal), the expectation is that in the extreme case we might reach the 3.2% unmployement rate (which is good) sooner (early 2022) than later. With industries moving to automation on a large scale, lower unemployement rates are hard to sustain.

*But with the reopening, there might be a spike in inflation but that will quickly subside due to the forces of globalization, opening up supply chains, cheap labor and goods. This is a case for lower unemployement and lower inflation.*

**How will we pay back the Federal Debt ??? The Inflation elixir**

We don't need to worry about higher debt, we only need to look at the level of public debt relative to GDP, because the costs of any debt level are less important when the economy is larger. The economy can be made larger in two ways

1. Increase in real production
2. Increase in the prices of the produced goods

Being a developed economy there is only so much the US can increase real GDP. The elixir of inflation will solve the problem for us. Here is a simple example

***Assume that inflation returns to Fed's target of 2% per year and the GDP growth rate is 1.5%, then the nominal growth rate would be 3.5%.***   
Guess, how much uncle sam pays for borrowing ???   
0.7 percent per year on its 10-year borrowing and 0.1 percent per year on its 3-month borrowing through 2021. At the end of 2019, 1.55 percent and 1.92 percent 

***Even without a primary budget surplus, the net effect of interest payments and growth would be to shrink the debt-GDP ratio at a rate of 2.0 (=  3.5 – 1.5) percent per year, when inflation rate is at 2%. Assume the reduction in debt when inflation rises to 3% or 4%. This reduction would increase to 3% and 4% per year which is huge.***

The same has happened after world war II when debt to GDP ratio is at current levels and it got diluted over the years because of inflation and the only way we will be able achieve is through lower rates, which is good for stonks overall. I believe the Fed will opt for a higher inflation target around 3%-4% before finally moving to increase any short term rates.

**Tl;DR**

Over-valued tech stocks might be taking a beating but the marker overall is poised to move up. Whether we see inflation or not, interest rates are going to be low atleast for the next three years if not more, else uncle sam can't pay his debt back.

87,lx9ils,"Want to get your thoughts on Slack's recent pull back after the Salesforce acquisition. I am still holding my $WORK position *(average price of $30.82)* though in the last 14 days it is **down 10%** to a price of **$40.04**. This seems very strange and perhaps there is an arbitrage *(correct term???)* opportunity to buy more Slack and get some profit. Feels like the recent tech selloff is just dragging  Slack down with it.

The Salesforce acquisition price *(according to CNBC)* was $26.79 a share plus 0.0776 shares of Salesforce ($CRM). The math and thus potential value of $WORK according to today's closing price of $CRM is then:

**$26.79 + ($205.01 \* 0.0776)  = $42.69 = value of Slack**

First, any idea when my Slack position will close out and convert into $CRM? I've never held a public company that got acquired before. What's this process look like?

Second, is my thinking correct that as long as the potential value of Slack is higher than the current trading price there is value. What are the gotchas I am missing?",Arbitrage opportunity with Slack? Undervalued based on the $CRM acquisition terms,0.52,1614821635,JustinK101
