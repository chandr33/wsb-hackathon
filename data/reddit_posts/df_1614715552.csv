14,lwb98q,"James, I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now. You must feel incredibly confused, angry and distressed seeing your money wash before your eyes. You’ve put years of your life into this and this one play is slowly taking it all away from you. You’re probably starting to understand that this is not gonna end the way you hoped. You’re taking risks that you probably haven’t taken before, hoping for a Hail Mary, but you’re having your doubts about it and know this could put you down even more than before.


And all by a bunch of degenerates who call themselves apes and who talk about their wives giving blowjobs to their boyfriends. You must think we’re all a bunch of assholes, and who can blame you.

You were the hero of the retail investors; it was quite a legacy and only in a matter of weeks, it’s all being taken away. I cannot imagine what’s been going through your mind. We all want to be remembered in a good light. And we all want to keep the money that we’ve invested over the years. 

James, I’m here to tell you that you still have a chance to redeem yourself. Right now, you’re being called a villain, but this can turn around. You can save yourself a bigger loss along the way and here’s how; buy back the stock and let us know you did. It’s time. Otherwise, you could lose it all. I’m sure you’re worried about your friends and what they’ll think of you. Eventually,  one of you will feel the pressure and crack, and you’ll be the one with the short end of the stick. Do you think they’ll warn you first? No they won’t. 

Hell, you can buy even more stock after and make back some of that loss! Think about your children and their children. Isn’t this what it’s all about?

Do it and you will no longer be Jim Cramer The Villain, you will be Jim Cramer The Redeemed, Patron Saint of Investments, Hero of Wallstreet bets. Your legacy will return, in fact it will be even bigger than before. The people who WSB will talk about you to their grandchildren about how you chose to do the right thing and stand for the retail investor. 

I wish I could give you all the time in the world to think about it, but the longer you wait, the bigger the risk. Good luck Jim.","Jim Cramer, you can still redeem yourself",1.0,1614715706,MortyMcMorston

56,lwbcjl,"Hey fellow apes, I’m so frustrated because supposed “Smart money” is less informed than the average retard in this sub, and I’m afraid that this moment in history will largely be remembered as a reddit-fueled pump that trades on no information. 


The conversation started because I was asking him about his feelings towards the recent GameStop saga. I was looking forward to a conversation where I could get some insight into the way market makers hedge against options, the way short selling (in particular naked short selling) impacts the market and the kind of liability that traders face when making these trades. 

Instead, I was met with grotesque regurgitation of CNBC bullshit, calling us honest retards “Reddit warriors” who trade on “hype” alone. He even brought up the Elon Musk phenomenon, and the meme asset which he has been accused of pumping. He spoke very confidently on the matter, and essentially summed it down to market manipulation led by Reddit bros who have nothing better to do. 

I tried to point out that the recent spike was due to the gamma squeeze rather than because of the shorts covering, and he kept bringing up the fact that “if Reddit had never existed, there would have never been this insane spike”...

The truth is that if you’re investing time researching the numbers, reading the Bull (and bear 🐻) thesis and spending time actively learning about the current environment, you are the expert on the subject, not any boomer who just happens to have been trading for longer. 

This is not financial advice, or even a prediction of what happens. It’s a rant coming from a misunderstood ape who only wishes that more people were spending time genuinely learning rather than accepting what’s on tv as gospel truth. 

TLDR: No one knows what will happening and very few people (if any) know what’s currently happening. Do your own research (DYOR) and don’t follow your emotions

Did you know that 32% of all fresh vegetables and 69% of all fresh vine crops sold in the U.S. are imported?

Did you know the UN has said the world will need 50% more food by 2050?

Did you know that 70% of fresh water is already dedicated to agriculture?

These are all startling statistics and when I started doing my research a couple months ago on $APPH and learning about the benefits of indoor farming I really fell in love with this company so I’m excited to share it with my 30,000+ subscribers.

If you are looking to invest in companies that are doing something good for humanity and/or doing something good for our planet then I would encourage you to consider $APPH for your portfolio.

**OVERVIEW:**

AppHarvest aka $APPH is an ag-tech company focused on improving our food supply through high-tech indoor farming and improved efficiencies in every way. $APPH is combining conventional agriculture techniques with cutting edge technology to grow non-GMO, chemical-free produce. The company has started with fresh vine vegetables but already has plans to expand into other vegetables and then fruits.

When I first heard of large-scale indoor farming it sounded crazy because I thought “why would someone spend the money to build a large structure in the middle of nowhere when they can just grow outside in the dirt for free” but as you study the industry and the data is clear that indoor farming is the future.

&amp;#x200B;

$APPH not only buys the land and builds these massive high-tech greenhouses but they also do the growing, harvesting and selling. They are a vertically integrated AgTech company with ambitious growth plans.

Their first facility is in Morehead, Kentucky. This building is 2.8 million square feet which is the size of 50 football fields. Next to the facility they have a 10-acre rainwater retention pond which is the size of 70 Olympic sized swimming pools. This water is captured from the roof and then filtered multiple times with sand and UV light as it’s recycled over and over throughout the facility. This is how $APPH is able to use 90% less water than open-field farming.

 $APPH not only buys the land and builds these massive high-tech greenhouses but they also do the growing, harvesting and selling. They are a vertically integrated AgTech company with ambitious growth plans.

 $APPH has the facility in Morehead up and running and has already broken ground on two more facilities that will be equally as large and productive — the Morehead and Richmond facilities will grow vine crops while the Berea facility will grow leafy greens. 

**PROBLEM:**

There are a lot of problems with traditional outdoor, open-field farming which include weather conditions (too hot or too cold, not enough sun, can only grow certain months of the year, etc) as well as insects/animals and the need for pesticides. Just think about the crazy weather we’ve had this winter in the US not to mention all the fires in California. If you talk to any climate/weather expert these problems are not going away and will likely continue to get worse and more unpredictable. In most areas of the country you can only farm in certain months. This is why indoor farming produces 30x the crop yield per acre.

Let me say that again because if you only take one thing away from this writeup I want it to be this — AppHarvest is able to generate 30x the crop yield per acre compared to conventional open-field farming. This is a mind boggling statistic and should be enough to convince most people that indoor farming is the future.

It’s pretty sad that only 10% of Americans eat enough fruits and vegetables. Part of this is because we develop bad eating habits as children or never learn how bad foods can impact our bodies but also because fruits and vegetables (especially organic) can get very expensive. If you are living on a lower fixed income you might gravitate towards the cheaper and less healthy foods. As a country we need to change this and one way we do it is by growing more pesticide-free fruits and vegetables in the US which means no more importing from other countries. There’s no reason why we should be importing as much as 50% of our fruits and vegetables from other countries. We need to increase our home-grown food supply, not just for us but for future generations.

**SOLUTION:**

We are dealing with a food crisis in the US and many parts of the world — it’s getting worse not better. This problem can’t be fixed overnight or by one company but $APPH will be part of the solution. Given the 30x yield per acre it makes financial sense to grow our fruits and vegetables in this massive indoor high-tech greenhouses with specialized irrigation systems to collect rainwater and then recycle it. It’s simply a better, cheaper, more efficient way to grow our most essential foods.

 These state of the art indoor farming facilities have the ability to control everything and therefore establish the ideal environment for whatever fruit or vegetable they want to grow. From the temperature to the humidity to the special LED lights to the water flow to the nutrients in the soil to the bees — everything is dialed in exactly how they want it. Nothing is left to chance. No more dealing with mother nature. No more hoping for sunlight. No more spraying pesticides to keep the insects away. Indoor farming is better in every way. 

 I actually have a couple friends that live in Kentucky and they have visited the $APPH facility and bought some of their tomatoes in the local grocery stores and they said they’re amazing — by far the best tasting and highest quality tomato that you can find anywhere in the country. The fact that Martha Stewart is a Board member and ambassador for $APPH means a lot because she only puts her name/brand next to the best.
