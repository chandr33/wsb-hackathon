31,m25r3j,"“$200 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Company, will pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 4.50% per annum” The conversion price of these bonds is $4.22 which is a discount of the current stock price. The number of shares that these bonds would be converted to is a little over 470,000 shares. This also states that convertible bond holders are receiving 4.5% interest annually which is a healthy number when considering other bond offerings. As a result of the healthy interest, it would be assumed the bond holders would not elect to convert and instead choose to receive the healthy interest year over year.

“The Notes will be convertible into, at the Company’s election, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock” This gives OPKO Health the opportunity to use the profits generated from the unforeseen pandemic revenue and pay off the bonds in cash. This would lower shares outstanding and help minimize dilution.

“The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to February 15, 2022, but may redeem the Notes, at its option, on or after February 15, 2022 if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.” This states that OPKO Health can close out these convertible bonds anytime after 2/15/2022 if the stock price is above $5.48 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days.

So now that the facts of the convertible bonds are laid out, I want to share my thesis off of my DD. This is one idiot’s opinion and should not be taken as advice. These convertible bonds act as insurance for anyone that holds them. The convertible bond holders are able to open massive short positions to hedge against $OPK defaulting on their loan. If $OPK defaulted, their stock price would plummet, and the bond holders would lose out on their principal they paid for the bonds but they would make a much larger amount of money on their short positions. If the opposite happens and $OPK reaches full potential and the stock price rises gradually, the bond holders will slowly cover their short positions and will simply cash in on their convertible shares or the cash, whatever $OPK elects to give. So we have big money players with hand in both the short and long positions and they don’t care which way the stock price goes because they will make a lot of money either way.
The catch here is that $OPK has done great work in the past year and was profitable in 2020. They are accumulating cash and will hopefully be able to pay of the convertible bonds in cash. The pandemic was unforeseen, and things have changed. Some convertible bond holders have most likely been covering their short positions and going long, while others still might be hedging against their bonds that they hold.
Long story short, February 2022 will be when $OPK can free themselves from the manipulation from these bond holders. The biggest thing though is that these bond holders know their time is limited to close out their short position. They have been gradually doing so and we have seen 40,000,000 short shares be covered in the past few months. These bond holders are hoping the true value of $OPK can be suppressed until they have enough time to cheaply cover their hedged short positions. The main take away is that $OPK can close out these bonds with cash. This would mean if stock price were to correct to fair values, they may lose on covering their shorts combined with $OPK paying off the bonds in cash and not shares.

I say let’s squeeze them out of their rigged game and make them actually feel the pain of losing in the market. We need diamond hands that have enough DD to know that $OPK is extremely undervalued at these levels. Let’s make these shorts and convertible bond holders scared of the power of the common people.",$OPK : OPKO Health’s Convertible Bonds that are often used by shorts to fear monger,1.0,1615403490,idiotmike69

65,m25szi,"Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.

I have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of ""security"" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.

That being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.

There's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.

I'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Truth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.

And let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.

So what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.

Not just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! 

You know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.

Based on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.

Fellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.

Now... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!",Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1/3 of GME and AMC,1.0,1615403620,SnooApples4563
