10,lw73x4,"Zomedica Overview

Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Zomedica (NYSE American:ZOM) is a veterinary health company creating products for companion animals (canine, feline and equine) by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians. Zomedica‚Äôs product portfolio will include innovative diagnostics and therapeutics that emphasize patient health and practice health. With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica‚Äôs mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.

 

Investors

Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (US:ZOM) has 45 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 54,381,501 shares. Largest shareholders include Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, BlackRock Inc., Millennium Management Llc, FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund, Geode Capital Management, Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Northern Trust Corp, and Winton Capital Group Ltd.

 

Team

I checked their employees who are on LinkedIn, I can confirm they are all top notch workers. Newly appointed CEO, Robert Cohen (former Pfizer exec) has taken three different biotech companies from $0.30 to $8.00/share.

 

What is Truforma

Zomedica's flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect &amp; diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in ~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents. TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States. Link

 

Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

44,lw79vl,"DD: $CKPT CheckPoint Therapeutics Recent Surge and Long Term Potential

 CheckPoint Therapeutics enters this space as a penny stock trading in the $3-4 dollar range and recently experiencing a surge similar to biopharma in recent weeks. This stock trended last week and I suspect it will again today so if you're going to play the stock at least know what you're going to invest in.

CheckPoint Therapeutics has 3 analysts upgrading ratings to $16-20 dollar range with Wainwright being the most prominent.

[https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/how-will-the-market-react-to-checkpoint-therapeutics-inc-ckpt-stock-getting-a-bullish-rating](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/how-will-the-market-react-to-checkpoint-therapeutics-inc-ckpt-stock-getting-a-bullish-rating)

These ratings are due to their two drug candidates. We are talking immuno-oncology here which as I like to post about offers the potential for headline like blast offs upon positive clinical trial results so that is a checkmark right there. The first candidate is a PDL-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, hence the CheckPoint name. PDL-1's are incredibly common in oncology therapeutics and have a whole interesting side business on testing for these immuno check points which is another DD I will do eventually, plenty of money in that business that is ancillary to biopharma (quest diagnostics is huge in this space). PDL1s are the number selling immuno oncology drugs on the market...using the immune system to attack cancers has been a trend now for many years in oncology development. No one will top Keytruda and Opdivo but you can hope to join the party

&amp;#x200B;

![img](bosk09rvgth61)

The main value of their PDL-1 candidate is in the binding affinity for the PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor which held high in vivo.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](1989jwyfhth61)

CKPT entered into an agreement with TGTX, TG therapeutics, which is another solid company in the space which now has their approved drug, Ukoniq, used in another of lymphomas. The partner company has shown the ability to get a drug to market with a better financial profile to ensure CKPT stays aboard the joint venture. With only extremely positive phase 1 results reporting and early phase 3 patient recruiting occurring, the catalyst will be quite far off and therefore may be worthy of waiting for this stock to drop a bit before entering. The $4 dollar entry from last week is a better price but to drop down but given the heated nature of the small cap biopharm market a dip to low $4's in the morning could be possible. Depends on how bullish you think these latest run of small cap BT are going to last. I bought this company in September for all the same reasons, although I bought at the peak in the $4's and watched it fall on back down over the last few months (i've learned a bit about that the last year), and finally it has come back to where I first entered after the release of the overall survival rate ORR in the phase 1 trial of their lead PDL-1 candidate. Phase 1 data usually means nothing more than indicating a companies internal desire to move forward with a drug candidate but in the NSCLC biopharm space those positive results can move the stock needle. CKPT also had a bought deal offering at the time to net 18.8 million. Hence the phase 2 data could offer another catalyst opportunity in 6-9 months as we experienced in September.

* *51.4% objective response rate and 13.5% complete response rate in half the planned pivotal cohort*
* *Interim results presented at ESMO Virtual Congress 2020*
* *On track to report full top-line results in mid-2021*
* *Potentially favorable safety profile compared to anti-PD-1 therapies*
* *Market-disruptive pricing planned in $25 billion PD-(L)1 market*

BioMedTracker has not evaluated the likelihood of approval for the drug, normal for phase I, however given the disease state and early ORR data, there is enough positive momentum that any positive news phase II likely has exponential potential (what a word combo). I'm more bullish on TG Therapeutics participation and experience in the field than that of CKPT tbh.

![img](a0mwjc30hth61)

This is truly why the stock boomed in seeing those phase 1 results compared to Merck's blockbuster, Keytruda

![img](8nfzz0jugth61)

The second candidate is an EGFR inhibitor to treat NSCLC which has a horrible 5 year survival rate even for localized malignancies. The US has decided we will pay whatever it takes to advance cancer treatment, so although utilization will contingent upon the clinical trail results which will ultimately determine the boom potential of course, the drug will be still attractive with less than stellar results given the use in refractory NSCLC patients with limited options. Honestly, any positive results will boom the price for a sell far more than holding and hoping the uptake of the drug vaults CKPT into a prime purchase condition for a BMS type larger oncology focused pharma company. They have 42 mill in cash with runaway cash until 2022 and no outstanding debt which means future direct offerings to dilute shares are possible or attractive sale opportunity given the lack of debt for the parent company to take a shot on their pipeline. With Merck's Ketyruda dominance in the immuno oncology space, it would not surprise me if CKPT were bought given so-so clinical trial results or become a golden goose with a competitive response compared to Keytruda in phase 2/3 results.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](sr6wrvfahth61)

I am not sure what the appropriate entry price is, and I do not advocate buying on weeks a stock goes up, but if the stock stays low in the morning near the $4 dollar range could be a buying opportunity, if short term players decide not to hold, if they do, then you may just have to wait a bit longer. The floor seems to have been raised with a triple down by BlackRock on 2/2 which may have helped spur the recent run with the strong institutional support.

[https://fintel.io/so/us/ckpt/blackrock](https://fintel.io/so/us/ckpt/blackrock)

However, the company is still shorted 36% which may be why the spike returned so quickly last week and another reason to believe that on the future spike due to a catalyst, the stock could have an immense boom through any squeeze. That is the knowledge I have on the company and feel free to play at your own will and make your own decision on an entry price.

-RKT net revenue for 4Q20 was $4.78B vs $3.92B estimated with EBITDA at $3.12B vs. $2.0B estimated. The gains on sale revenue was $4.22B which was up by 178% y/y.
-Rocket Mortgage has also partnered up with Morgan Stanley Bank where they will service mortgages for Morgan Stanley and ETrade. This is huge because it will open more market to them. 
-RBC analysts predicts closed loan volume in the range of $98B to $103B vs an estimate of $57B, which will generate large interest revenue.
-There‚Äôs been a big wave of mortgage refinancing and the US population entering peak first time home buying period. RKT will continue to take shares in the current market by underwriting new mortgage loans and refinancing existing loans. The company targets to reach 25% market share built on technology platform thats designed to handle $500B of annual volume.
-Some risks to consider: mortgage industry is highly regulated, business model is dependent on interest rates and sensitive to economic conditions. 
Given the post Covid times are in sight, Americans sitting on large amount of cash, interest rates extremely low and likely to remain low, I see Rocket to be in strong place in 2021.

64,lw7bwd,"As far as my understanding goes, currently the only rare earth mining company in North America is $MP. $AREC mines metallurgical carbon used in processing steel, which could be significant if there is an infrastructure overhaul in this administration, but $AREC is also poised to begin mining rare earth materials. The company holds around 16 patents related to things like producing graphene, social responsibility mining, better rare earth separation techniques, I think also retrieving material from things like used batteries, and like $500 mil in real estate assets. The company has been negative revenue, but is set to turn that around this year becoming increasingly profitable over the next 5 years. China holds the market on rare earth minerals so companies like $MP and $AREC are going to be supported toward reducing a reliance on China, not to mention a shortage in rare earth materials as EV markets grow. Supposedly $AREC might also be able to do things like put together batteries on site. I think a lot of its success hinges on things going right, but at &gt; $5 a share, I'm not sweating it. $MP is new to the market and is trading at $50/share, so consider $AREC's potential...
