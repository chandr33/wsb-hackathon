Anyway I came up with an idea for this freak train. Yes it’s okay at the moment but I want the GME freak train to be a bullet freak fucking train with 50. Cal machine guns on each side BLAOW BA BA BA BA BA KA KA KA KA KA. 

Anyway moving on from my utter retardness, I love what we did with the Ape Santorum and we got good coverage off it. So I came up with an idea, what if we stuck ape sticker all over our cities and towns? I would attract soo much traction and would probs be on the news if a big number of people did it.

12,m6sv8z,"Hello fellow autists,

I am presenting an opportunity that has risk but the rewards are much lucrative. Alibaba (BABA) is a severely undervalued tech stock that serves over 1 billion people. **BILLION.** Lately Alibaba has had a barrel of bad news but every analyst and hedge fund on the street agrees on one thing...it is a premier undervalued blue chip tech stock. Nowadays where you fuckers throw 30% OTM calls at all sorts of stuff even though the stock is at 52 week highs. Well I am presenting you a diamond in the rough that also happens to be a mega cap. 

**What is Alibaba?**

 Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group and as Alibaba.com, is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. The company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. **To summarize it is the Chinese Amazon (AMZN) and does all sorts of things.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Alibaba is a great company with great growth prospects but you don't need me to tell you that just look at the numbers.**

 \-Alibaba’s e-revenue for 2020 was $41.7 billion

\- The latest available info shows that the Alibaba Group held 55.9% of the Chinese ecommerce market

\- In Q3 2020, the percentage of profits that Alibaba generated just from commerce in China was 62%. 

\- Alibaba’s GMV on Singles’ Day in 2020 reached $74.1 billion.

\-**THE PE RATIO IS 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE for a super growth company**

With a five-year annualized  earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.

Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.

The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.

Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's **cloud-computing business** is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.

Alibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.

Sales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's video streaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.

**Why buy Alibaba right now? They have got butt fucked raw the past few months by the Chinese government? Most recently the Chinese government told Alibaba to dump their media assets.**  

The risk is simple, will the Chinese government continue to make investors uneasy and weigh on Alibaba. They just told them to dump their media assets.... which weirdly enough would be bullish.  An analyst at Morgan Stanley made the case that it would be a positive for Alibaba to do so, as it would improve its margins and provide it with more capital. Their media assets lose them money. The analyst reiterated the firm's overweight rating and $320 price target. **It has only been negative news lately and you must buy when others are fearful.** 

I am a capitalist loving spitfuck, I am no commie. If you want capitalism to thrive throw some money into this strong fundamental company.

**What is the play and why now?**

**May 21 240 Calls** 

The stock has gotten wrecked and has showed stabilization. This is a great opportunity to enter in and ride it to tendie town. Worst case scenario it breaks 220 support and you eat the losses. Best case scenario it skyrockets leading up to earnings in May and you cash out for great gains. It will by no means be an easy diamond hands. This stock moves very crazily, I am currently down 9% on my calls. But when IV picks back up and it skyrockets we will be driving lambos. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

On my etrade research all the analysts have price targets of 285+, average target of 325, and highest being 395. And those guys get paid a lot more than I do to do research.

23,m6sxps,"Good evening retards,

I felt the need to write this because of another post on here that got quite a bit of traction regarding GME. The submission was titled "" **GME has a -8 Beta. Evidence shorts have yet to cover** "" and it had a screenshot of what I believe was a bloomberg terminal with the beta information.

**BASIC STOCK KNOWLEDGE:**

The thing is, BETA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SHORT POSITIONS AT ALL.

 ​Beta= Variance/Covariance​ 

**where:**Covariance=Measure of a stock’s return relative to that of the market Variance=Measure of how the market moves relative to its mean​. 

What does all them words mean? It means Beta is just a calculation of how a stock reacts compared to the general market. It is generally a number between 0 and 1 but it is still common to find a beta higher or lower than 1 and 0 respectively. It doesn't take into account how an individual stock will move when there are upcoming catalysts, it just gives you a general indicator of how a stock has been performing compared to the general market.

Here is a link for more information on BETA: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-formula-calculating-beta.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-formula-calculating-beta.asp)

**SO WHAT DOES GME HAVING A -8 BETA MEAN?**

GME having a -8 beta doesn't give us any new information. It tells us that the Beta calculation doesn't know what the fuck to expect from GME when the market is up or down because it's movements have had no relation to the market, the longer GME doesn't react to the overall market the further away from the normal range it gets.

Want to take a wild guess as to why? 

retard 1: MARKET MANIPULATION

No, shut the fuck up retard,

retard 2: uh, we like the stock?

Good job retard, It's because a large group of apes have been focused on one stock and buying it regardless of what the rest of the market is doing for 3 months, so it is acting entirely independent of the market. It means that on a day the market is down 10%, GME might go up 500%. On a day the market is up 5%, GME might go up 20%. On a day the market is up, GME might go down 200%. Poor beta bitch doesn't know what the fuck is going on.

**SO WHY DID THAT POST SAY IT WAS PROOF THE SHORTS HAVEN'T COVERED?:**

Good question, I think we found the autist in the group. I was wondering that too, and then the account that posted it deleted their entire account 2 hours after the post. 

Had the poster not deleted their account, I may have thought they were just a dumb fuck and let it go, but now I am suspicious that the purpose of that post was to test all of you, and I think that test was very successful. What were they testing? How you react to confirmation bias when you're shown information you don't understand. I have to say it exposed a FUCKTON of people that were ready to rally behind the information and lend support to the theory as though they knew what the information meant. A lot of the people that saw that thread will probably wake up tomorrow and post about how GME's beta is -8 in the webull comment section, I plan on checking that in the morning.

**BUT WHY MAKE A POST HYPING GME WITH BAD INFORMATION IF WE'RE ALREADY HYPED ABOUT GME?**

It's not so much about the stock itself, it's about potential to manipulate how the community thinks, or things they will look at when making decisions on a stock. Maybe a month from now someone posts some exciting DD with pretty colors and graphs that have nonsense information, general sentiment in the thread is positive and people throw their money in pumping up the stock price. Maybe they were testing how long the mods would leave the post up with bull shit information. I'm not sure why they did it specifically, I can't know, but you should be aware of shit like that.

Here is the comment section graveyard from that thread so you can decide for yourself how effective it was: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6p4t6/gme\_has\_a\_8\_beta\_evidence\_shorts\_have\_yet\_to\_cover/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6p4t6/gme_has_a_8_beta_evidence_shorts_have_yet_to_cover/)

&amp;#x200B;

**SO YOU PROVED THE POST WAS BULLSHIT BUT WHAT'S YOUR POINT I STILL LIKE GME:**

My point is, even if you are the laziest of fucks and all of your DD is whatever is trending on WSB, at A BARE FUCKING MINIMUM GOOGLE TERMS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW BEFORE GETTING HYPED ABOUT SHIT AND THROWING YOUR MONEY AT IT. You're in a community of retards, some retard telling you what something means doesn't necessarily mean they are correct, they're retarded after all. By now you're probably interested in the stock market and when GME and AMC do their thing you'll probably still throw some money around at stocks, accumulate some basic market knowledge as you go along. Like a WSB word of the day calendar look up one thing a day and sooner or later maybe you'll be an autist.

But looking past the money, when we get to the end of this, America will really become the land of the FREE! Imagine. A life with no student loans, no mortgage, and no car notes. Nothing Other than excitement for the coming day keeping you up at night. To be truly Free! This is what this war is about.       
   Big banks have lured many into their illusion of freedom enslaving many for generations; we have seen now that they control the media so our narrative on freedom have been scripted to their benefit. But the tides are turning! Technology has shone a BRIGHT light in the darkness they have kept us in for centuries. And now it is UP TO US TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY to reclaim our freedom. WE BUY, AND WE MOTHER FUCKING HOLD!!! 
  Think about it. Why do you think they are fighting so hard? They know that losing this war will break open the flood gates which they have put in place to control our progress. They also know that this war will usher in A NEW ERA!  One where we will see currency FULLY decentralized, monopolistic capitalist strongholds crumble and be replaced with a more human centric, and earth conscious leaders. One where humanity can truly shine forth (we seen so Many examples of humanitarian acts just off the little gains we’ve seen so far) and address issues of our planet. Hedgies are fighting so hard because in this new word, they would be punished for all their crimes against humanity. So they are fighting for their lives!! But this is an uphill battle for them that is slowly coming to a devastating and climatic END! 
   Now knowing what is at stake here, and knowing what you have to do to create that future for yourself and for your legacy, I HOPE YOU ARE AS AMPED UP AS I AM!!  I have been through so much uncertainty in my life. So much hardship. But what has kept me going is the belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel And giving up now only means I will never get to see that light. Using that mindset in this war, I SEE THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE AND ALL I NEED TO DO TO BASK IN THAT LIGHT IS TO HOLD THROUGH A FEW MORE UPS AND DOWNS! 
    Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will stop me from getting to that light. I deserve that light my generation deserves that light. WE All deserve that light. it’s our right as human beings to live in that light and all we have to do to get there is FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!

44,m6t8ev,"Alright, tuck yourself in. It's story time.

It was February 2020. The markets were roaring at all time highs, the mods were super gay, and the air smelled like WSBgod's cum along with thousands of wsb folk getting rich on absurdly far OTM TSLA calls (seriously *retardedly* far out of the money calls... I'm not joking here). The atmospheric composition in here was 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% adderall dust.

The winds were changing though. It gradually stopped smelling like cum, and instead started smelling more like viral RNA of bat meat origin. Wallstreetbets was coming to grips with what was about to happen to the world, and CNBC was still talking about the democratic primaries and how extraordinarily overvalued TSLA is (lol).

Here is an example DD from that era. For context, there had been 15 confirmed cases in the US when this was written, and the uncertainty around the IFR of the disease was still large.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff173u/diamond_princess_coronavirus_protip_update/

Notice what's in that thread? Sourced information. Predictions. Price targets. Tickers. Wild napkin calculations. We were scrapping and fighting for anything we could get. There are hundreds of threads like these in WSB from early pandemic era in late February. Bulls lined up and bought calls (rip), Bears lined up and bought puts ($$$), and the mods made one guy drink his own piss because of TSLA.

When NYC got hit, just as we had predicted, the markets started to free fall. The S&amp;P 500 crashed over 35% in a matter of 2 weeks, and this sub got fucking rich. The front page was inundated with +10,000% gain porn from calls on VIX, SPY puts, casino, cruise, and airline puts. Occasionally there would be funny loss porn from some poor cannon fodder of a human bag holding MSFT 220 c, but we didn't laugh at them until they finally bought puts at the literal hard bottom of the crash.

My point is, we got rich because of good DD. We scrounged around where most news outlets did not. We found the preprints, we read the early travel and epidemiological models, we knew what was coming here. We didn't make up crazy theories based on wild leaps in logic.

tl;dr Do your due diligence, make sure it's *actually* good and it makes fucking sense before hitting the post button. Your goal here is to get rich, so be honest and unbiased in your assessments.

One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.

Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.

""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release. 

And so they did, but then they had a problem.

The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know. 

And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.

Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""

And this was the game that they made up:

#Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours minimum to flip again.

This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in. 

This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time one wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias. So at most you would have to flip a coin 20 times in order to sell 100% of your shares, having sold 5% each time you sold, and the fastest you could possibly sell off would be 10 days before you would have zero stock left to sell.

This is part 5. Part one got taken down due to a Clerical error on my part. I'm really Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if this is finally enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike took out parts two, three and IV. Volatile!

So I ain’t been here long and brought GME first at @60 after the first spike to happen in jan and learning about this sub. I have loved this community soo much and it has generally brought me joy how open and funny whilst joking around we can all be. 

However what the fuck is going on now? 

People who are spending their free time making DDs are just being shit on. They are doing it because they are genuine people and want to help out this community!

Also what the hell is this GME vs AMC shit? It’s absolutely pathetic to see because this is what the Heggies want. Can’t you see that! I was slaughtered on one of my posts yesterday talking about how strange the two doing the opposite was  and I got shat on saying stop attacking AMC when I specifically said there wasn’t any hate towards the stock and that I like BOTH STOCKS.

Coming up with ideas as well people just immediately shit on it or any criticism towards GME or AMC and people go haywire saying that they are a bot or a shill, when the only way to get better is to see the mistakes!


This sub is getting toxic and it is sad to see but I want all us apes to HOLD ON IN THERE. These are strange times and no one knows what’s going to happen. But we should be there for each other before expecting anything drastic to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

READ THE REPORT AND SCROLL. THE ENTIRETY OF CITADEL. FUCK THEM.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how many more small brokers are within this group but they now own the fucking game for some. THEY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT OUT.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: I WANT ADVICE FROM MODS. I'm instigating a huge fucking sell off here and that is detrimental considering the circumstances.**

**But I also do not want my shares to now be owned by Citadel. They want our shares? Seems like they can just buy the broker and manipulate it that way.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2: E-Toro does not allow transfers. Withdrawal of funds can take** ***'up to 8 BUSINESS DAYS.'***

69,m6tesw,"Hi guys

So I ain’t been here long and brought GME first at @60 after the first spike to happen in jan and learning about this sub. I have loved this community soo much and it has generally brought me joy how open and funny whilst joking around we can all be.

However what the fuck is going on now?

People who are spending their free time making DDs are just being shit on. They are doing it because they are genuine people and want to help out this community!

Also what the hell is this GME vs AMC shit? It’s absolutely pathetic to see because this is what the Heggies want. Can’t you see that! I was slaughtered on one of my posts yesterday talking about how strange the two doing the opposite was and I got shat on saying stop attacking AMC when I specifically said there wasn’t any hate towards the stock and that I like BOTH STOCKS.

Coming up with ideas as well people just immediately shit on it or any criticism towards GME or AMC and people go haywire saying that they are a bot or a shill, when the only way to get better is to see the mistakes!

This sub is getting toxic and it is sad to see but I want all us apes to HOLD ON IN THERE. These are strange times and no one knows what’s going to happen. But we should be there for each other before expecting anything drastic to happen.

An army is only as strong as its weakest solider

TLDR

ARkK grew 3.5% YTD, while MOON did 39%

Main difference seems Moon's focus on biotech instead of other big tech

TELADOC INC	5.8 %

BAIDU INC - SPON ADR	3.4 %

SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY SA	3.2 %

XUNLEI LTD. ADR	2.6 %

VIR BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.	2.6 %

PLUG POWER INC	2.5 %

NANO DIMENSION LTD SPONSORED ADR	2.4 %

IROBOT CORP	2.2 %

(Except for fuelcell, plug and irobot, never heard of the above companies)

Checking for overlap between the two, I found only FATE therapeutics(according to 
https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php)

What do you guys think? Too early to say MOON will win over ARKK in the long term? 

Ps: since I am based in EU, I can't buy either of these etfs. However, arkk has inspired me to buy into baidu and tdoc is my biggest holding (bought before I heard of Arkk). Regarding Moon, only company i own that overlaps with the moon holdings is plug (but not as individual holding, but through IQQH). Plug is 10% of iqqh, and iqqh is my biggest holding",Cathie's copycat MOON ETF overperforming ARKK 10x,1.0,1615961443,futureIsYes
