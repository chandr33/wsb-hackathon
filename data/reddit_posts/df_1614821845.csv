37,lx9slu,"Okay guys. 
This my first time writing a DD so bear with me. 

First the company we are talking about is Exelon Corporation 

Exelon is a holding company which owns in full the following subsidiaries: Exelon Generation Company, LLC, Commonwealth Edison Company, PECO Energy Company, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Pepco Holdings LLC, Potomac Electric Power Company, Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company, Atlantic City Electric Company. 

Stats: share price: $39.53, market cap 38.6B, EPS 2.01, P/E 19.67, forward div yield $1.53 (3.89%), Net Income 1.96B, total rev 33B

On 2/24 the company announced it would spin off it's generation and energy marketing unit. The company said separation will establish the nation’s largest fully regulated transmission and distribution utility company and the largest carbon-free power producer paired with the leading customer-facing platform for clean, sustainable energy solutions. The stock has barely budged since the announcement. Every stockholder will get a piece of the spinoff company and the resulting utility will be 100% regulated which should lead to a multiple closer to 30. As for the generation company it's an open question on the value but I feel it's energy mix and disproportionate use of nuclear  leaves it well positioned for a wide range of future policy and regulatory scenarios. 


Exelon has the largest number of electricity and natural gas customers in the U.S. Exelon does business in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada and had 2020 revenue of $33 billion. Exelon serves approximately 10 million customers in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania through its Atlantic City Electric, BGE, ComEd, Delmarva Power, PECO and Pepco subsidiaries. Exelon is one of the largest competitive U.S. power generators, with more than 31,000 megawatts of nuclear, gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric generating capacity comprising one of the nation’s cleanest and lowest-cost power generation fleets. The company’s Constellation business unit provides energy products and services to approximately 2 million residential, public sector and business customers, including three fourths of the Fortune 100. 

Generation is one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas, including renewable energy, in competitive energy markets to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation has ownership interests in thirteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 23 units with an aggregate of 18,880 MW of capacity. 

Generation is currently 60% carbon free with 40% nuclear, 20% renewables, and the rest natural gas with no coal generation whatsoever. 
Generation’s nuclear fleet capacity factor of 95.4% was the company's second highest ever (owned and operated units) for 2020. Higher Generation earnings in 2020 due to lower nuclear fuel costs; lower operating and maintenance expense; and unrealized gains resulting from equity investments that became publicly traded entities in the fourth quarter of 2020; partially offset by a reduction in load due to COVID-19; lower realized energy prices; lower capacity revenues; and increased nuclear outage days.

Exelon introduced 2021 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range of $2.60-$3.00 per share, reflecting growth in Utilities, offset by impacts of the February severe weather event, lower realized energy and capacity revenues at Generation. Exelon Utilities project capital expenditures of $27 billion over the next four years to benefit its customers, supporting 7.6% annual rate base growth

Exelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2022, subject to final approval by Exelon’s Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions.  

On Feb. 21, 2021, Exelon’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.3825 per share on Exelon’s common stock for the first quarter of 2021. The dividend is payable on Monday, March 15, 2021, to shareholders of record of Exelon as of 5 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, March 8, 2021. 

That's all I think this could and should go up as we continue to approach the spinoff. This is pretty far off as well so be prepared to hodl for a while and take your 4% dividend in the meantime. I feel as we get closer to the spinoff date it will increase in value.",Exelon Generation Spinoff,0.46,1614822548,duck_speaker

I’ve been following this stocks for months.. bought a ton around $11 and been watching it clearly get manipulated down to $7.75 (which btw is what it sat at exactly at close for two days which btw is the exact amount shareholders would be entitled to receiving if the company were to go bankrupt and liquidate assets.. coincidence? I dunno) 

Also coincidence it started to take off on one of those days after it closed at 7.75.. again I dunno, and really doesn’t matter

Main point: I think tutes kept this stock as low as possible leading up to the March 10th deadline of locking in shares in order to qualify for the 1st quarter dividend to be paid in April. 

For this reason alone I see this riding up for the next 6 days. Maybe even throwing in a short squeeze (which CNBCs Najarian specifically mentioned a possibility of for this stock today morning)",$UWMC Simple thought on why I think it 🚀🚀🚀,0.74,1614823527,hakopc
