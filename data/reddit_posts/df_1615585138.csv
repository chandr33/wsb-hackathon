5,m3rvq7,"Final Response to your Complaint
Thank you for taking the time to contact us, Trading 212 UK Ltd (""Trading 212""). We are sorry that you felt it was necessary to make a complaint about our trading platform.
In your complaint, you raised the following two issues:
A. You are unhappy that you were unable to access the Trading 212 trading platform on 27 January 2021 and believe that Trading 212 breached our regulatory or contractual obligations as a result; and
B. You are unhappy that you were restricted, by Trading 212, from purchasing shares in GameStop Corp. and other stocks on our platform on 28 January 2021 and believe that Trading 212 breached our regulatory or contractual obligations as a result.
Trading 212 is commited to providing a high quality financial service. As part of this commitement, we treat your complaint seriously, and we have carried out a thorough and impartial investigation into the issues that you raised.
Having assessed the evidence and considered relevant guidance we are unable to uphold your complaints. We address each of the complaints you have made and the reasoning for this decision below. Please consider this letter to be our final response to your complaint.
A. Access to Trading 212's Platform on 27 January 2021
On 27 January 2021, there was a period of downtime on the Trading 212 platform for some users, a period which corresponded to the opening of the US Market. The downtime was a result of unprecidented demand for Trading 212’s services. This demand was created by unprecedented external market factors beyond Trading 212’s reasonable control, including by users of various social media platforms acting together to artificially increase the prices of certain stocks, including shares in GameStop Corp. (""GME"").
We have investigated your complaint regarding the above disruption, and have concluded that Trading 212's actions were justified, that we did not breach our regulatory or contractual obligations, and we are not liable to you for the disruption to our services, nor for any losses sustained by you as a result of this disruption. We provide details for this conclusion below.
When you entered into an agreement with Trading 212 to trade shares on our platform, you:
(i) acknowledged that Trading 212's platform may be subject to disruption and downtime caused by external factors; and
(ii) agreed to waive any claim against Trading 212 in relation to loss suffered due to disruption to the provision of our trading platform due to circumstances outside our reasonable control (also called a ""force majeure"" event).
In particular, we draw your attention to the following three clauses:

i) under clause 25 of Trading 212's Terms and Conditions, Trading 212 is not liable for any disruptions in the provision of our services to you where this is caused by events beyond our reasonable control (i.e. a force majeure event). This includes providing access to our trading platform;
(ii) under section 6.4 of Trading 212's Share Dealing Terms of Business, you agree to wavie any claims against Trading 212 in respect of both lost profits and also in relation to trades that you would have executed at a specific price during a downtime. You also formally acknowledged that there may sometimes be technical issues or faults with the Trading Platform; and
(iii) in our Risk Disclosure Notice, we include a reminder that the computer-based systems and services used by Trading 212 are vulnerable to disruption, delay or failure, which may cause you to lose access to the trading platform. It also states clearly that, on accepting Trading 212's terms, you also accept that Trading 212's liability is limited in relation to these disruptions.
We provide a copy of the abovementioned clauses at Schedule 1 for your records.
B. The Restricting on Trading
On 28 January 2021, Trading 212 made the decision to prevent clients from purchasing GME and some other instruments that were experiencing irregular volatility. The restriction was prompted by circumstances outside of Trading 212's reasonable control, including Trading 212's liquidity provider restricting access to GME (including Trading 212's acces) which impacted Trading 212's ability to offer GME for trading on our own platform.
We have investigated your complaint have concluded that Trading 212's actions were justified and that we acted appropriately in restricting trading in GME and other related instruments on 28 January 2021, as further set out below.
First, on 28 January 2021, Trading 212's liquidity provider, a reputable global investment firms, restricted the provision of liquidity (i.e. trading) in all affected instruments. As Trading 212 was restricted in our ability to access shares from the liquidity provider, we were also restricted in our ability to offer those shares on our platform (i.e. make those shares avaliable to you to trade). This disruption to Trading 212's services was caused by events beyond our reasonable control and, as stated under the heading ""A. Access to Trading 212's Platform on 27 January 2021"", Trading 212 is not liable for such force majeure events under clause 25 of our Terms and Conditions .
Second, Trading 212 is contractually permitted under clause 5.12 of our Share Dealing Terms to ""suspend and/ or remove from the Trading Platform any Financial instrument and Market Hours at [its] sole discretion"". Trading 212 therefore has the power to restrict trading in GME (as well as any other shares) for any reason.
Third, Trading 212 can also take such action where we consider that it may materially reduce market disruption. As a related point, the FCA confirmed in its statement on 29 January 20211 that firms such as Trading 212 are under no legal or regulatory obligation to offer trading facilities to clients, and may withdraw their services in line with their terms and conditions should they consider it necessary or prudent to do so. For the reasons set out above, it was necessary and prudent for Trading 212 to temporarily restrict our offering of shares such as GME.
In addition to the above, firms such as Trading 212 are required to take reasonable care to establish and maintain such systems and controls as are appropriate to our business. The obligation does not require

Trading 212 to continue to offer an instrument for trading that is expereincing a market volatility event. By contrast, we view the actions which were taken by Trading 212 to restrict trading in GME (and other instruments) in response to this extreme market volatility event as evidence that our systems and controls are effective. Under our terms and conditions and in line with FCA guidance and market practice, Trading 212 was able to take steps to prevent harm to our clients and the markets during the GME market event and responded appropriately to it.
We provide a copy of the abovementioned clauses as well as the relevant FCA communication Schedule 2 for your records.
Your Regulatory Rights
Whilst we empathise with your situation, Trading 212 does not feel that you are due any compensation in relation to this periods of abnormally, as the circumstances described were beyond Trading 212’s reasonable control and in accordance with our regulatory obligations and customer terms and conditions.
If you are not satisfied with our handling of your complaint, you have the right to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, free of charge. The time limit for referring complaints to the Ombudsman is six months from the date of the original decisions regarding your complaint, which is the date of this letter.
If you do not refer your complaint in time, the Ombudsman will not have our permission to consider your complaint and so will only be able to do so in very limited circumstances. For example, if the Ombudsman believes that the delay was as a result of exceptional circumstances.",Trading 212 finally responded to my complaint. What’s next ?,1.0,1615585236,Internationa_Mudlark

/[Jcw122](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jcw122/) in case the auto mod deleted my reply:  
 Like I state in my DD, EXPI reached platform maturity this year and by that, I mean that they began reaping the fruits of their investments and work. Their net income transitioned from negative to positive as the platform matured over the last few years. Look at their YOY growth in their agents, the company's revenue is driven by the number of transactions closed by their agents. So as the agents grow, the revenue grows. This company IMO should be worth 25B at the moment, minimum. It is not speculation like Zillow nor is it constrained to the US like Zillow is. EXPI is expanding globally and is going to be making all the TENDIES at a global scale. I mean look at these financials, any reasonable APE would know that this is solid. Other companies like Zillow, Redfin, etc are theory, this company is the  IRL PRACTICE.   


If you still don't believe in this, then you sir are a 🌈 🐻 ! Have a good day sir!

43,m3s21b,"As Dr. Sid Gilman approached the stage, the hotel ballroom quieted with anticipation. It was July 29, 2008, and a thousand people had gathered in Chicago for the International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease. For decades, scientists had tried, and failed, to devise a cure for Alzheimer’s. But in recent years **two pharmaceutical companies, Elan and Wyeth, had worked together on an experimental drug called bapineuzumab, which had shown promise in halting the cognitive decay caused by the disease**. Tests on mice had proved successful, and in an initial clinical trial a small number of human patients appeared to improve. A second phase of trials, involving two hundred and forty patients, was near completion. Gilman had chaired the safety-monitoring committee for the trials. Now he was going to announce the results of the second phase.

One prominent investor was known to have made a very large bet on bapi. **In the two years leading up to the conference, the billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen had accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Elan and Wyeth stock**. Cohen had started his own hedge fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors, with twenty-five million dollars in 1992 and developed it into a fourteen-billion-dollar empire that employed a thousand people. The fund charged wealthy clients conspicuously high commissions and fees to manage their money, but even after the exorbitant surcharge investors saw average annual returns of more than thirty per cent. S.A.C. made investments in several thousand stocks, but by the summer of 2008 the firm’s single largest position was in Wyeth, and its fifth-largest was in Elan. **All told, Cohen had gambled about three-quarters of a billion dollars on bapi.** He was famous for making trades based on “catalysts”—events that might help or hurt the value of a given stock. Sid Gilman’s presentation of the clinical data in Chicago was a classic catalyst: if the results were promising, the stocks would soar, and Cohen would make a fortune.

**But soon after Gilman began his thirteen-minute presentation, accompanied by PowerPoint slides, it became clear that the bapi trials had not been an unqualified success.** Bapi appeared to reduce symptoms in some patients but not in others. Gilman was optimistic about the results; the data “seemed so promising,” he told a colleague. But the investment community was less sanguine about the drug’s commercial prospects. **One market analyst, summarizing the general feeling, pronounced the results “a disaster.”** The Chicago conference was indeed a catalyst, but not the type that investors had expected.

**It appeared that Cohen had made an epic misjudgment. When the market closed the following day, Elan’s stock had plummeted forty per cent. Wyeth’s had dropped nearly twelve per cent.**

**By the time Gilman made his presentation, however, S.A.C. Capital no longer owned any stock in Elan or Wyeth. In the eight days preceding the conference, Cohen had liquidated his seven-hundred-million-dollar position in the two companies, and had then proceeded to “short” the stocks—to bet against them—making a two-hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar profit. In a week, Cohen had reversed his position on bapi by nearly a billion dollars.**

Gilman and Cohen had never met. The details of the clinical trials had been a closely guarded secret, yet S.A.C. had brilliantly anticipated them. **Cohen has suggested that his decisions about stocks are governed largely by “gut.”** He is said to have an uncanny ability to watch the numbers on a stock ticker and intuit where they will go. In the assessment of Chandler Bocklage, one of his longtime deputies, Cohen is “the greatest trader of all time.”

But federal authorities had a different explanation for S.A.C.’s masterstroke. More than three years after the Chicago conference, in December, 2012, prosecutors in New York indicted a young man named Mathew Martoma, who had worked as a portfolio manager for Cohen. They accused him of using confidential information about bapi to engineer the most lucrative insider-trading scheme in history. **According to the indictment, Martoma had been receiving secret details about the progress of the clinical trials for nearly two years and, ultimately, obtained an early warning about the disappointing results of the second phase. His source for this intelligence was Sid Gilman.**

Why would the Chairman of GM sell so many shares if she believed in her company.  I believe that GM is way overvalued and should be in the low $40s.  They are an imitator in the EV market, are prone to fail on executing long term strategies and all they really have right now is the Bolt and a lot of hype.  Tesla is an innovator with better cost of production.  They also do not have the legacy cost that GM has.  The same is true for the other new startups in the EV market.  

I encourage you to now join with Mary Barra and sell GM, even if you don't have it.  I think the market will reward you.  Todays close is $59.19.",time to short sell General Motors (GM),1.0,1615586136,Financial_Dragon

The music for todays post is **Terrible Bear Attack** by **Bongripper.**  Put it on.  The entire album is good. In fact just start from **Reefer Sutherland** and work your way up to it.

**This is not financial advice.  I am not a professional.  Tell me when I am wrong.**

I have a lot of calls in March and April 

You should listen to nothing I say Bruh

But look bruh...

Bruh, I'm Glad your back bruh,

Dude bruh I was so high bruh... I was so fuckin' high bruh...

and everything was cool bruh and then like bruh I smelled smoke bruh

Shit was on fire mannn  and it was the **50 day MVA** bruh and i was over my head bruh,

you don't understand bruh

# The 50 day MVA was over my head bruh...

Today started out like many others, GOEV bulling out the gate and just destroying shit. We did this before. Released the hordes over ran silly sell walls, kicked in doors took plunder and moved on.  In the distance was the prize. Gleaming 16$.  It was the only thing between us and the sick GammaRamp Dildo of Naughty Gainz posting.

We ran up on it, Got pushed back, Ran up on it again and again got pushed back off the stage, Voltron jumps up, swerves fakes, and then does the Philadelphia eagle all over Gojira's face.

For the rest of the morning Voltron and Godzilla are fighting on a cliff edge for fucking hours.  Hours on this tightrope edge. Shit is going down. Couches are getting broken in half and thrown into the mc Donald's ball pit. The toddlers are running the daycare. The candy jar is empty at the nurses station. Fuck, I forgot its our anniversary again honey.

The car is on fire. There is no driver at the wheel.

The crowd roars when Voltron drops a back cracker on Gojira.  Theres voltron kicking the shit out of a big lizard, people cheering from the balcony, hes looking hot. You're all smug looking at your mad gainz.   Gojira is all beaten up, getting tossed around.   Cup to Handle Voltron climbs on top of the ring and jumps arm out stretched, Gojira rolls out of the way and bam theres Mecha all dazed, Gojira starts winning some more fist fights, the mecha is sparking, slipping... loosing his groove...

the fans we're a little nervous, some people are even switching to some copium..

""We want them to accumulate SI here...""  ""When the big boys get back from lunch, they'll make the move. Junior traders don't know the MechaBot kungfu and aren't authorized to deploy lightning sword...""

Round 12:30 the handle started smoothing out and the bull flag banner started to lean farther and farther over till...

12:50 on the money Godzilla just straight kicks Voltron in the nuts

**World Star**

and that's exactly where everyone who bought tickets to this ride after 10:00 today got to sit.

**You just paid money to have a gigantic lizard kick you in your robotic nuts.**

I feel bad for you.

10 minutes later the bosses get back from lunch and want to know what the fuck just happened.

# Welcome to the Jungle... I was wrong about yesterday.

Today was the day shit got real.  A big boy woke up and put us on notice that they aren't going down without a fight.  Luckily we have the battlefield for now.  EVs are hot.  Capital seems to be leaving other plays and flowing to Canoo.  Macro is good. Nasdaq set for a run.  We got Roth in a few days and even with all that bear violence.  Our Gamma Ramp is still lopsided and we did well today. 

I bought the dip a bit. Won't lie.  The thesis is still in place...  We took a lot of violence and continued to raise the price.  You might still be holding a gun, but admit it... you got a little nervous there didn't you. I'll write something bullish for Monday.

I will give the big lizard this.

 Acknowledge us!! 

All we want is to be able to comfortably feed our families.  We break our backs building those sky scrapers you work in, and you just try to spit on us from up there like we are nothing but ants.....

Come on man, just give us this win.  You have fucked the average family consistently since the beginning.

You have so much money you don't even know what it feels like to be ""average"" anymore.

We are struggling down here.  My grandfather worked his entire life doing construction, the man worked until he was 70 years old, right after he retired, he passed from lung cancer.

You would think that being a well to do man, didn't booze, didn't gamble.  He worked hard and that was it.  You would think my grandmother would be okay now right.

You are WRONG!  She is losing her home, that she raised all 7 of my aunts and uncles in.  70 years of hard labor wasn't enough for them to make it, and you are complaining about a few billion being scraped away from your 100's of billions, that you literally only need to move a finger to make?!

94,m3scqy,"For those of you who don't know about Max Pain Theory, the max pain price is the share price that will result in the most options contracts expiring worthless by Friday.  

Hedge funds and big money mostly do not buy options... they sell them. They have a BIG incentive to drive share prices to the max pain price so that they can let them profit the most off of the derivatives market.  

While the max pain price isn't always great indicator of exactly where a share price will end up by Friday, it is a fantastic indicator of price direction. I would advise referencing the max pain price before EVERY trade you place to avoid bull and bear traps.  

[http://maximum-pain.com/options/fsr](http://maximum-pain.com/options/fsr)  

Don't rely solely on a share's max pain price, but before you go to place a trade use it to tell you if it's a good idea or a bad one. I love this sub and I want to see you guys bleed these manipulative bastards dry, so here is my gift to you.

PS: Catalytic events will cause a share price to sharply deviate from the MPP, so it won't be very effective against stocks like GME rn!
