Not only does the poster have no clue what they're talking about, but all the top comments are in blind agreement without actually understanding what is being said.

Hello! So I'm *incredibly new to trading stocks*, and have just been setting aside some chump change to play around and get used to seeing numbers go up and down.

Now I was just wondering, with nations pushing for more climate change fixes, and less fossil fuels, I bought some stock in US SILICA HOLDINGS INC (a Silicone manufacturer SLCA) and in Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP). Are these safe bets? I see that they're doing somewhat well, and I've made around 41 cents! but should I be buying more shares of these? What is the general consensus on companies focusing on green energy? With shifts away from fossil fuel create demand for certain commodities/materials?

I know that a lot of issues surrounding Green Energy Tech is how to control the power supplied with the demand needed. That meaning Solar has peak efficiency when people don't need the energy as much. Does this lend itself to other energies? Will fusion, Wind, or other technologies become the backbone? if so, how would this effect the market? will energy overall get more expensive? or less expensive?

If you got to here, thanks for reading! I hope to learn a lot, and to generate thoughtful discussion! and there's a lot of questions here, but don't feel obligated to answer all of them!

If you're still on that piece of trash platform you're essentially choosing to stay in an abusive relationship. RH showed in January that they either can't or won't support you during large market events. The reasons why don't even matter, they can't. 

Harken back to the Cuban AMA. Remember that? One of his foremost pieces of advice was to get a real broker with a trillion dollar balance sheet. Fidelity or Vanguard, pick one. Doesn't matter which they're both boomer hellscapes to interact with but they at least have your back.

Now do a partial account transfer. This is \*faster\* than a full account transfer and just transfers specific shares of your choosing. I did this and transferred my volatile shares to Fidelity and they were only in limbo for a day or two. Then I did my full account transfer separately, and that took about two weeks of which 4 days or so the shares were truly locked up.

If this seems too hard then maybe you should know that there is a non-zero chance RH may disable *selling* during the squeeze. Did you see that recent offering to give you cash for deposits? They're desperate for money and on their last legs. If anyone asks them for a big chunk of collateral they are instantly GOING TO FOLD AGAIN. It might sound harsh but if this happens and your shit is locked up and you can't sell, that's your own damn fault. It's been a month and a half that people have been screaming to get a real broker.

WSB TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀$IRWD🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc is a strong buy out candidate due to their flagship drug Linzess and its current partnerships, a otherwise very limited pipeline, recent unexpected CEO exit, and (most importantly) large insider share purchase from activist investor Alex Denner of Sarissa Capital whose focus is on increasing shareholder value usually through forced acquisition


**The Thesis**


**Product**

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals ($IRWD) is a biotech company that focuses on gastrointestinal drugs. They currently have one major drug, Linzess (linactolide), which is a novel action drug used to treat IBS which was approved in 2012. Since that time, it has been an excellent drug and has steadily been making consistent revenue for Ironwood (~$400M revenue in 2020, $106M GAAP income). They are partnered with AbbVie for US brand and commercialization collaboration, this is key as they could be a potential suitor. In Japan they are partnered with Astellas, and in China with AstraZeneca.  Ironwood's other pipeline products have either been unsuccessful over the past 5 years or are pre-clinical (ie so early they don't yet provide much value and in fact cost a lot of money in valuation). This has been destroying shareholder value as all the money made by Linzess is not being reflected in the share price and the company is not doing well on developing another blockbuster drug.

**Sarissa Capital and Alex Denner**

In case you aren't involved much in biotech, Alex Denner is the big swinging dick no board member wants in their company. Mainly because his MO is to infiltrate your board, buy up a bunch of the company, and then leverage it to increase shareholder value (his own mostly, but also he says yours). Usually this means sale of the company. He started out under Carl Icahn at Icahn Partners but then spun off and started his own company Sarissa Capital. Here are the last three company's he has been involved with: Ariad (Takeda purchased for $5.2 billion), Bioverativ (Sanofi purchased for $11.6 billion), and The Medicines Company (Novartis acquiring for $9.7 billion). All of these were at premiums around 50-75% of current traded share price. 

**Alex Denner and Ironwood history**

Sarissa approached Ironwood in 2018 about Denner joining their board. From a news article at the time, ""But after three meetings with Denner to better understand his intentions for the company, Ironwood’s executives decided they weren’t thrilled with the prospect of him on their board. In a statement, the company said Sarissa hadn’t made a strong enough case to appoint Denner, considering the boards existing diversity."" Here was Denner's response after the share price jumped 10+% at news of his interest: “To the extent that they state in their press release that they’re concerned with what investors want, I’ve been told that more value has been created for Ironwood shareholders today than in any single day in their history.” Fucking legend. [Full press release here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sarissa-capital-issues-statement-on-ironwood-pharmaceuticals-300657237.html) centered on how Ironwood should be improving shareholder value. 

While Ironwood initially rebuffed him joining their board in 2018, they did implement many of his recommendations from the press release above. Namely, separating their R&amp;D division into its own separate company instead of funneling all of the great revenue their flagship and established drug was producing into failing pipeline drugs. 

Then in late 2019, they all the sudden let him join the board. His comment at the time, “I look forward to working with my fellow board members to create value at Ironwood.” 4 month later in 2/2021, the CEO of only 2 years steps down rather unexpectedly and an interim CEO is implemented. 1 month later, Denner starts buying up shares. 

**Insider buying**

So I noticed that Denner bought about $13M in shares on 3/02 which was shortly after the announcement of the CEO leaving, this brought up his ownership to over the SEC rule of 5% meaning he now needed to file a Form 4 every time he made another purchase. This seemed pretty fucking suspicious timing wise with the CEO leaving so I've spent the last few days looking into Denner's history and prior involvements with other biotech companies, particularly those that were bought out. While I was doing this, the motherfucker bought $10M more shares in large batch orders (one on 3/05 and 3/10). I strongly suspect he has actually bought much more than this because there have been several large block purchases over the past few days as well. But the forms for &gt;20% influencing owners SEC reporting are different than if you are say a ~10% passive owner and I suspect these take longer to come through (10 day allowance per the SEC). So I will be on the lookout for if a Schedule 13-D from Denner comes through the SEC. I am not the most knowledgable about the SEC form requirements so I could be off base here. [Here is an article about this difference in SEC filing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp#:~:text=3%EF%BB%BF-,Schedule%2013G%20is%20a%20shorter%20version%20of%20Schedule%2013D%20with,meets%20one%20of%20several%20exemptions.)

With the recent purchases, IRWD has become Sarissa Capitals largest portion of their portfolio (total value around $1 billion) at 16.32%, [see here](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/sarissa-capital-management-lp)

**How I am playing this**

The timeline is difficult to assess on this. At earliest, the purchase would not likely be for 6 months given SEC rules on insider buying. Thats even if he plans to create a buyout at all. I belive given Denner's history, the lack of pipeline, the pre-existing commercial partnerships, and need for more global footprint of this drug the best option is to sell to AbbVie or some other large partner. I do not see Denner attempting to buy all of these shares just to install a more shareholder friendly CEO.

Given that the timeline is variable and possibly mid to long term. I bought shares and calls in August and leaps for Jan 2021 at $15 and $20 strike. I think a bear case buyout would be $15 and best case would be $25 but I expect somewhere around $20 given his previous history. The leaps were just added today so the premiums are inflated but I will be looking to buy more of these over the next few weeks to months. The August calls were cheap as dirt. I will be following the options prices closely and adding a bunch more as the buying power of options is much higher than straight shares and I have strong conviction this sale will happen in 2021.
