0,m0rako,"Listen up all you man babies.  If you're interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! 

Sonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both 'stay home' and 'reopen' trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. 

TL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. 

**What is a Sonos?**

*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* 

Basically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they've said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). 

**Reasons for buying them long term:**

I could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos' systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I'm only going to focus on TOMORROW. 

**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** 

New product announced.  Go look at Sonos' stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they're going to announce.  It's already been leaked.  It's the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. 

[Here's a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)

But here's why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn't picked up on this because it hasn't hit any of the media they cover.  It's going to be new information to them.  While you'll have the leg up on it. 

The Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  

To give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that's worth 12% upside from it's closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. 

**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** 

Let's imagine you're having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don't.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  

Now let's pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q's numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you're going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. 

Situation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they'll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they're confident. 

**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**

I'm cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it's likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos' management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. 

**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** 

I'll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos' catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don't want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They've been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. 

**In conclusion:**

Sonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I'm happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more. 

Positions: 1500 shares, 3/19 35s, 4/16 40s, 7/16 45s.

I hate seeing the number of top posts that are screenshots of Robinhood profiles. Have you learned nothing? Do you like being in an abusive relationship with a someone, in this case a broker, that's designed to front-run you, and not only take your money, but sell your information, and look good doing it?

We have learned that Robinhood is the antithesis of its name.

You have been told to delete your account and move somewhere else or risk losing your money through no fault of your own.

A stock broker that doesn't allow you to buy stocks is not a stock broker.

What do we like here on Wall Street Bets? Making fucking money and karma.

If we stop upvoting these RH screenshot posts, and start downvoting them instead, it might actually get through your thick monkey skull to finally move to a real broker. Do it for their own sake.

The drop wasn't really due to any of the shit I said before (yet), everything was bleeding, but when life throws money at you, you shake dat a$$.

Took profits throughout last week, can see the [Xpeng gains](https://imgur.com/x6SSu50) here and [Nio gains here](https://imgur.com/SCpGZsM). Could've been more, but I ain‚Äôt fuckin Miss Celo.

\*\*Why'd you sell pussy?\*\*I'm just playing the dip. I had to get into some other positions, and will load up again at the top when we dead cat bounce, everything explained below. This ain't financial advice, I just don't like these stocks.

Let‚Äôs check in on Q1 2021 projected PS ratios as of Friday‚Äôs close. These are going to real interesting once we get to Q1 earnings.

TSLA: 15.7

NIO: 17

XPEV: 15.3

Li: 10

There were some short term catalysts in the mix that also sprayed fuel to the fire last few weeks.

\- Nio missing EPS, hemorrhaging money

\- XPeng stock lock up period ended

\- Lackluster feb delivery numbers from both

Well, how do you keep the growth story fueled? You need to grow Rev. How do you grow Rev? You need to grow deliveries. For all the reasons described in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/), I don‚Äôt see them breaking out in the sea of competition. For some reason, people think Nio and Xpeng are the only 2 EV companies in China. I did a casual forecast on deliveries for Feb. [Look at it and tell me where Nio and Xpev sits](https://imgur.com/8G5dlPt). This is not even all the smaller, upcoming players who didn't make top 20...

Yes, there is a Chinese new year effect in Feb on deliveries. All the millennials head to their hometowns from big cities, gloat to their parents about how much money they made, get questioned on when they‚Äôre going to get married. Little do they know, they‚Äôve just been in a claustrophobic 1b apartment, stroking it to Fan BingBing on the daily. Ok, I digress, in reality, Nio and Xpeng have tiny pepe order books, and if you‚Äôre actually a hot growing EV brand, CNY shouldn‚Äôt affect you that much. Just look for Feb 2020 in the most updated deliveries chart. (Tesla Feb 2021 numbers will be out next week, I‚Äôm betting on this).

Nio‚Äôs EPS miss was no surprise if you look at their cost centers. They posted a growing, healthy vehicle margin, but tucked away a sickening amount of costs, just like your secret cum bucket.

\- All their early adopters, till last month, were still getting FR33 LIFE TIME battery swaps. So much for those service Revenue dreams

\- All those pretentious ass NIO houses? Prime real estate locations, yeah you bet rent is expensive AF. This doesn‚Äôt even scale, if NIO drops vehicle prices (which they need to if they want to grow) = more NIO customers = crowding NIO Houses = less desirable. Forget crazy, even Sane Rich Asians don‚Äôt like to share with plebs, even without covid.

Xpeng doesn‚Äôt have it any better. There are 13,000 vehicles being recalled. I mean, that‚Äôs pretty much their entire Q of deliveries, Q1 earnings is going to be a bloodbath. Oh, shares lockup also ended on 2/23/2021, what would you do when your company is a get rich quick copy of Tesla? You dump those shares faster than Bogdanoff can make a call on his BB.

**Outlook for 2021**

Is Nio and Xpeng going to 0? Not right now, they‚Äôve got more tricks and the YT pumpers haven‚Äôt gone through the 5 stages of grief yet. We'll likely see a dead cat bounce. Will wait until all these Nio ""investors"" are back in their circle jerking habitat, then pull the trigger and load up PUTs again.

Let‚Äôs dispel some of these dilutions being force fed to you. It's time wake your ass up from that confirmation biased wet dream.

1. Competition is fuckin fierce in China. Nio themselves have already cut their guidance, but based on chips shortage. I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs more than just the Pringles, since CN Government tax credit got cut starting 2021.
2. ‚ÄúCCP is backing Nio!‚Äù Yes, Nio has gotten some support from Hefei, a TIER 2 city in China. A single Tier 2 city does not equal the CCP. All these small city govs are trying to claw up the power ladder, so they can play in the big Tier 1 city leagues. As soon as Nio shows signs of weakness, they‚Äôll drop‚Äôem without a second thought. Just like when your wife finds out were 100% maxed margins on NIO from last week.
3. ‚ÄúBut global expansion!‚Äù Here we go again. Besides what I already said in Part 1 about western demand for ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù cars, think about it. Nio and Xpeng are playing in the biggest EV market in the world, instead of focusing attention on their home turf, where they‚Äôre still far from winning, they‚Äôre trying to expand overseas? That‚Äôs like getting into foreplay with Kendall Jenner, but you‚Äôre licking your lips and looking at Bruce in the other room!

Nio and Xpeng could just float around for awhile before the makeup comes off, but it'll become more apparent every quarter. There is always the off chance we get a you know who Coffee scenario, but they have 3 years to comply with audits.

**What am I bag holding next?**

\- TSLA 3/19 $580 Cs  
\- Rest all in on Tesla and Rocket Lab commons

Nio and Xpeng are in the back view mirror for now, will load up PUTs again after the bounce. But the EV revolution is still happening. Who do you bet on?

My TSLA position got beat up like Elon in grade school. But just like papa in 2018, I‚Äôm doubling down and holding shares like a boomer. With the nice volatility we‚Äôre going to see in this upcoming kangaroo market, I‚Äôm taking advantage of the sky high IVs and selling CCs after short term catalysts.

1. CN Feb deliveries for Tesla, that‚Äôs coming next week. This will be the first peak at Model Y numbers. You bet there is going to be movement, I sure am. See my naked calls above.
2. For those of you that are looking at Tesla and think it‚Äôs still got a long way down to go, think again. Tesla's bottom line is about to get juicier when Q1 numbers roll around. For all the crying about Tesla making most of its profits from credits, it‚Äôs only about to get even more lucrative. Credits are not going away, take a look at the schedules (ZEV for example), it's only ramping up towards 2025. Simple supply and demand, more credits needed, legacy auto EVs deliveries absent, Tesla has them for sale.
3. FSD is about to make the news cycle again. Elon said subs are coming Q2. But hey, you don‚Äôt have to believe the boy who cried wolf, because Auntie Cathie will save the day with ARK‚Äôs new report on Autonomy and PT on Tesla. It‚Äôs nice when you have the hottest (popular‚Ä¶) fund manager pumping your stock.

At the end of the day, this correction could go on longer, but there is no existential crisis here. Tesla is going to keep selling cars like Samoa flavored girl scout cookies. Those Credits and Sub Revenues will flow straight to the bottom line on earnings.

Next up, Rocket lab. I won‚Äôt go into it, [you can read my post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwffta/rocket_labs_dd_found_the_company_that_actually/). This is going to be the beginnings of the next EV-like rally. When you can‚Äôt buy $paceX, Rocket Labs is your BFF. You can bet it'll be in ARKX.

As always, JJ

The $DMTK Melanoma Test is a new kind of lab test that looks for signs of melanoma in your skin‚Äôs genomic material.¬†

 With the traditional biopsy care pathway, clinicians use their eyes ‚Äî aided by a microscope ‚Äî to see physical changes to a mole (aka pigmented lesion), and the cells within it. If the dermatologist is concerned with the mole they will order a biopsy, performed with a scalpel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The $DMTK test uses a gene expression test to analyze the RNA inside those cells.

Since the $DMTK testing method can find indications of melanoma at this more precise level, the disease can be detected far earlier and more accurately than the current biopsy pathway. This is all done from cells lifted off your mole with a simple pain-free adhesive sticker, not a scalpel.¬†

 Cancer starts when genes mutate within a cell. This altered cell duplicates and duplicates until enough cells exist to be seen under a microscope (and then, eventually, even without one). $DMTK‚Äôs genomic analysis can find these altered cancerous cells long before they show up under a microscope, through a proprietary gene expression test. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qcyf1g01ovl61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b67577b45a23c35a7fc2ccd7b36e5e60b9854587

 

The expression test to search for PRAME and LINC00518 is done through an amplification process called RT-PCR (a polymerase chain reaction) that makes billions of copies of these genes so our scientists can study them in detail. When this analysis shows excessive levels of the PRAME and/or LINC00518 gene, it correlates with the presence of melanoma.

$DMTK‚Äôs genomic testing smart patches have been such a breakthrough they also have agreements with companies like Biogen, L'Oreal, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to evaluate this technology in clinical trials for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne and other skin conditions.

**COLLECTION PROCESS:**

If your doctor has identified a suspicious skin spot ‚Äî one they would normally take a photograph of and track ‚Äî now they can use the $DMTK test to rule out melanoma with 99% accuracy and better than the 83% accuracy of the current biopsy care pathways.

Once they have identified the spot, they‚Äôll open the ‚ÄúAdhesive Skin Collection Kit‚Äù to begin the test. They‚Äôll use the smart sticker to lift skin tissue off the spot by pressing, rubbing, and lifting the sticker. They‚Äôll do this four times, placing each sticker on the collection strip.

The collections strips are then sent to the $DMTK lab in La Jolla, California where a team of experts and Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) oversee a fully automated testing process. The $DMTK Gene Lab is the first and only commercial lab to extract nucleic acid (and other proteins) from non-invasive skin samples.

 Results are sent to your physician in about 3 business days. Your doctor will use this information to choose the best path forward for your treatment. If the genomic markers are there, this will typically result in removal of the spot. If not, you‚Äôve likely saved yourself a scar.

**OLD WAY vs the NEW $DMTK WAY:**

With millions of unnecessary biopsies occurring every year for suspicious pigmented lesions (moles) it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand why $DMTK‚Äôs non-invasive method is so attractive to both medical professionals and patients not to mention $DMTK‚Äôs smart patch is easier, faster, cheaper, pain-free and more accurate.

**MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

Everyone reading this newsletter knows that every form of cancer is scary and potentially deadly but I didn‚Äôt realize how many cases of skin cancer were diagnosed every year.

Sadly the skin cancer market is one of the biggest and still growing quite rapidly. $DMTK has an opportunity to save countless lives over the next several decades with early detection of skin cancer so patients can get the treatment they need before this horrible disease spreads to other parts of their body.

$DMTK estimates their current PLA product plus additional pipeline products will address at least a $10 billion market.

 

**PIPELINE:**

$DMTK‚Äôs PLA test is their first commercial product but they have several more in the pipeline that are addressing equally as large markets in the skin disease and skin cancer industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**TELEHEALTH:**

$DMTK sells its products primarily to pathology and oncology practitioners however there‚Äôs an emerging opportunity (mostly thanks to Covid) to offer telehealth services with DTC (direct to consumer) kits whereby consumers would collect the samples off their bodies and ship them to the $DMTK Gene Lab for processing.

&amp;#x200B;

**GROWTH STRATEGY:**

Now that $DMTK has their viable PLA commercial product their challenge will be ramping up the sales team to go after the dermatology and oncology medical professionals. $DMTK ended 2020 with 40+ sales reps which gives them significant coverage in most major markets.

 $DMTK has increased their marketing efforts as the pandemic comes to an end which means more dermatology offices will be able to function on a normal schedule. Since approximately half of all $DMTK patients are over the age of 60, the pandemic has had a clear impact on the older population being able to see their medical professionals in a timely manner. 

 $DMTK is doing more digital marketing with an emphasis on ‚Äúfind a specialist‚Äù to help drive traffic to the dermatology offices in their network \[[click here](https://dermtech.com/find-a-specialist/)\].

As of mid-2020, $DMTK‚Äôs smart patch test is now eligible for full reimbursed by Medicare at $760 per patch with private payor coverage on the horizon. At some point in the future $DMTK‚Äôs smart patch will be the new standard of care rather than just a better alternative.

 

**FINANCIALS:**

The current financials and revenue forecasts for $DMTK are nothing to get too excited about because we‚Äôre still dealing with small numbers compared to more established companies in the healthcare industry.

However I believe $DMTK could grow revenues at 100% per year for the next 3-5 years (maybe longer). I have spoken to several dermatologists over the past couple weeks and they all said that $DMTK‚Äôs new smart patch is an absolute game changer for them and their patients.

Based on $DMTK‚Äôs December 2020 estimate of 2,900 billable samples processed the 2021 revenue estimates of $12 million will end up being way too low if the company continues on this same run rate however given the number of new sales reps it‚Äôs likely this monthly sample processing number continues to increase as well.

**TRIALS and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:**

Whenever you are investing in the healthcare industry it‚Äôs important to take note of intellectual property, namely patents, that will protect the company going forward. Due to the company‚Äôs strong IP portfolio and solid pipeline I do wonder if they could be an acquisition target someday. These types of transactions are impossible to predict however with so many large pharmaceutical and biotech companies sitting on piles of cash it‚Äôs always a remote possibility.

**SHAREHOLDERS:**

I like when the shareholder base has a nice mix of retail, institutional and insider ownership. I‚Äôm glad that 12.3% of $DMTK outstanding shares are owned by insiders including the founder ‚Äî this gives them some skin in the game (no pun intended).

This is how you can risk all of your wendy's paycheck 100% risk free.

Now this is what I do so copying what I do while certainly an option üí¶ is not recommended.

The first step in how I take say $1,400 and put it into extremely risky positions with 1000% potential while also guaranteeing $1,400 remains in my account by the EoW is by firstly following sound advice. When it comes to options the ITM longer term dated Gen X strategies are great and like has been said 1000x üí¶ around here already, is very similar to holding a long position in the underlying stock.

Once you do this after proper money printing or institutional greed the price of the stock will steadily rise. That is the magic of infinite credit and that is worth its own post. You however do not have that advantage and so the day that your ITM (ATM) LEAPs return 100% EoY (I know said EoW), as well as 7-8% market return average you can close out your position. In this way you have satisfied every standard of a boomer and can move your initial paycheck into index ETFs for extremely tiny volatility compared to what you just experienced for a year.

Now step two: after returning 100% you can now put $1,400 risk free into extremely dangerous high reward positions without a shred of emotion. 0 dte purchased before close. The moon is the limit.

Step THREE: every time this new portion of your YOYO portfolio returns over 100% move the investment into your sleepy, drooling index funds. If you repeat this strategy you will have zero fear in the market. Half of the people here are in this situation and cannot relate to your desperate Wendy's back-alley situation.

My portfolio looks like an amusement park. This is not financial advise.

TLDR: purchase safe investments such as ATM index LEAPs and close your position out when you achieve 100% (ROI) + 7-8% (market RoR). Buy index ETFs with the initial investment + the 7-8% RoR and then spend the matched gains on extremely risky FDs and experience no emotions. Maybe get tendies.

So I sold my call premiums at $190 hoping GME would hit support levels around 170 so I could use the proceeds to purchase a more reassuring and potentially profitable 3/19 call.
