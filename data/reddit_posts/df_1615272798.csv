They are going to soread fun

Senate hearings for bad actors in general (Banks, hedges, jack dorsey, big pharma, crooked politicians, and fuck zuch is just a complete circus at this point.   

It always has been.    It's JUST A GAME to pretend like the bad guys that you don't like will get in a lot of trouble , be taken down , assets seized, of arrested.    We have all seen it for multiple different people these past few years.      Nothing EVER GETS DONE.  

All it is, is angry questionnaires that's go on for hours straight.

Politician: This is a shame what you did, where were when all this happened? 

Them: I can't really remember that much, but we're looking into at the moment so we can correct these problems in the future. 

This is your senate hearing all day for ANYONE the past few years...

Paid for Politician: bad bad bad bad bad , did you do this??? DID YOU DO THIS? 

Them/Corp: I don't have those numbers with me but currently we are working to get it here as soon as possible. 

Politician: What about this then? What happened here? Why is this and that happening?

Them: I can't remember exactly, I'd have to circle back to you.  It might have been an error we later fixed. 

Paid for Politician: you don't remember ?? Your the top guy , and you can't remember ?
I know you did illegal things. Why did you do these things? I have the evidence right here that shows you did this. 

Them: well, at the we were following protocol based on federal guidelines and some team members got confused. 

Paid for: You know , what you did was wrong, and if we don't fix the actions now, it's going to set a dangerous precedent. Ok next politicians ...

""Politician #2"":. Do you know this X persons on this list?  

Them: I dont know

#2:. Well they said they know you, and we have multiple communications proving that. 
What you're doing is bad.  

Them: I understand, but we were just trying to do the right thing, were already dedicating tea to handle this for the future. 




Then nothing happens after that. Literally NOTHING.  It's all a Show to keep us occupied and make it look like  things will be done. 

BUT THEY WONT!  It's all there to quiet the noise down because they are ALL CONNECTED SOMEHOW.      If any normal person was in charge , many people at hearings would be arrested soon after. 

 Now robinhood is coming in tomorrow with a Team of FUD spreaders.  To push other paid for politicians to draft a bill to outlaw speculation.  To tell you speculation on meme stocks should be ILLEGAL for your own good.

This shitty advice, but proper documented, will not be long. 
The hedgefunds are abusively manipulating the price rise of the stonks starting last week and probably the first days after the stimulus reaches your account to make you wanna join the retard apes’ club of fighting the hedges. 

The hedges need to cover their shit and they wanna try it by using US GOV stimulus (individuals’ money) for fake rise of the stocks. Once you get the stimulus dont throw them at high prices of the stocks. Wait for a real, market regulated, dip process. Hedges are trying to squeeze your money at high prices. Look at the month of february, the did it the same!

They are artificially pumping the stonks, making you believe the are on a pattern of getting to the moon!

For the apes having stonks, and holding diamond hands, you are doing the good thing, but remember what #DFV did, he sold stonks at the highest, waited for the market regulated dip, and bought...again. And he will do the same, soon! If you feel comfortable to sell, do that, do at your own recognizance 
 

This is not an advice! I am a retarded ape, autistic and quit smart, swimming against the flow! 💎",Dont buy #GME #AMC #BB using your stimulus paid by the US GOV,1.0,1615276348,iondelaraion95
