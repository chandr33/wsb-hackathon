99,lxnclk,"**AMKR – Amkor Technology** \- is a SUPER undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space. Great financials. The company has a market cap of 5B with revenues of $5B. &lt;---- WHAT??

Positions - (This amounts to 50% of my portfolio)

1. 3/19 - 5x 23C
2. 3/19 - 24x 27C
3. 3/19- 30x 26C

AMKR provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla

***1.*** ***Financials are great***

5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7

Okay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

The company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.

Low volume

Great financials

***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***

Semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..

***3. Outlook is great:***

last earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -

“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”

Financial highlights:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

To summarize:

1. Great outlook
2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. Great revenue and P/E
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. Feb 16th - S&amp;P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion

I am no financial advisor, but I love the stock and think it's about to go to the moon
