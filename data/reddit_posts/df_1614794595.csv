5,lx07bd,"The movement we saw yesterday was insane and it was all thanks to wsb. The Media had no idea what was occurring until the price reached the 40’s. (Around 2-3pm ish  EST yesterday) I’ve been eyeballing this stock since it was around 25, I got in at 29.63, and was surprised it took the media so long to catch on. Right now there are a lot of uneducated people that are selling. My opinion is that the don’t know that this stock was already a set up for a squeeze before the big hype caught on yesterday.  95% of shares are owned by rkt, yesterday we simply made the situation worse for the short sellers. There were already more shorts scheduled than stocks available prior to the massive buy yesterday!!! These hedge funds are not going to cover as the price goes up. They are going to wait until it goes down which is what they are hoping for. GUYS the market price is going to explode regardless 💎. I personally believe we can hit 100 if people don’t keep dipping out from being scared. 



Please educate yourself on stocks you invest in prior to putting your life savings. At least understand the concept that is being exercised 😂.



This was already squeezed when most people started getting in yesterday!!! We just need to wait for the hedge funds to buy all those shares! 



I am confident that if all the noobies leave the price will still hit the moon :).



EDIT: Please comment if you have informative insights. If you are bearish on this stock please present a valid argument. I am open to other opinions, the whole purpose of this is for us to learn together based on our opinions!

EDIT: Changed wording because it seemed like I bought at 25. I just became really Intrigued  at this price point which is better than most people who got in later yesterday!

13,lx08fk,"Good Morning Everyone.

Even with the evidence of synthetic shorts being a primary driver for the downward pressure we are seeing on certain stocks, I felt it was worth mentioning that if your account has margin on it, tucked away inside the terms of having margin it states that your shares can be used to lend to short sellers. This can happen regardless of you borrowing on margin or not. If you buy your shares in a margin account you are providing additional shares to be sold short (ammo to the enemy, if you will), which gives more leverage to the downward pressure we're fighting.

If you already own long shares in a margin account and you want to keep these shares from being lent out to short sellers, you can reach out to your broker and request that they be either moved to a cash brokerage account, or confirm that they are being held in ""Type 1"" / cash status.

Maybe this is a moot point, but I felt it was worth sharing for those not familiar the terms of margin accounts. I'll list a couple of customer account agreements and margin agreements from popular brokerage firms where it states your shares can be used to sell short in the comments.",A quick note on adding a little extra fuel to the fire for battling short sellers.,0.78,1614794707,Wreckeshey

Similar to what RKT has done just for different reasons. Koch Industries just bought a portion of PQ Corp in all cash and now they are going to offer a one time special dividend possibly up to $3.25. 

Current share price is 17.03 so you’re looking at a 19% return by end of March. The board hasnt officially approved it yet but they just did another special dividend back in Dec. and the turnaround time for that was pretty quick. I like easy money as much as the next guy. 

Not a financial advisor. Just like the stock.",(PQG) $3.25 one time special dividend on a share price of 17.02. Easy DD for Easy Money,0.59,1614795103,goodtilcancelled
55,lx0e6a,"Light DD. Suggesting a quick 10% gain that might not be suitable for more retarded, risk seeking investors.

OSTK crushed earnings but dropped something like 16% last Tuesday. This is in keeping with the overall market sentiment- bond yields are increasing, beer virus stock winners are returning to a normal world etc etc. 

The last time they reported earnings, it was a similar fiasco. Up like 20% early hours on huge revenue boost then actually finished red like 20% as investors realized they have no inventory. (Inventory has since before more available)

It's a day trader's top stock pick because of such crazy volatility. In my opinion, it's never had a chance to find it's true value because it's been squeezed and day traded abusively for two years. 

And- I need to be cryptic with how I say this so I don't get blocked- it's a good play for alternative uhh coin stuff.  Like, if alternative coin stuff keeps pushing at new highs, that would be really good for OSTK's medici ventures. Medici is a small facet of OSTK's revenue, but it's fascinating what they've been accomplishing. They issued a small dividend a year ago that's up 901.88% at the time of this post. (It's not really a dividend. Idk what the fuck it is, to be honest. They just issued it to me and it grew. Ticker is OSTKO if someone wants to explain it to me.)

Their main publicly traded competitor is W. W also had a rollercoaster earnings day. Early hours shot way down (jussst enough to trigger my stoploss order) then corrected way up. I think most of everyone saw they had a 16% run-up on Monday. There's yet to be a post earnings run-up for OSTK.

I might lose some apes here, but I'm going to discuss risk/reward. Most recent extreme low was $47 about a month ago. Most recent high was $110 a couple weeks ago. OSTK is now trading at $65ish. Low volume is below most averages and, given the 🌈  🐻 news on tech sell-off, it seems to be finding support.

Housing market up also bodes well for the furniture industry. 

This stock has always been for thrill seekers so I'm not going to promise to drink my own piss if it drops further. Positions: 552 shares of OSTK @ 67.13 and 233 shares of PYPL @ $275.4.",OSTK,0.66,1614795103,Furnitureman80085
