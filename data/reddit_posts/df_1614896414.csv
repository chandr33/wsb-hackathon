16,lxx3kj,"TL;DR - at the bottom. Make you atleast scroll through my work. 

I’m not gonna pretend to be some sort of mathematician nor am I a financial advisor  that you should listen to but my smooth brain does work sometimes so listen the fuck up.

The market has been absolutely taking a beating in recent weeks. It’s a blood bath out there to say the least. Yet somehow GME is continuing to maintain and/or rise above the market even on the bad days. The market plummeting could be due to a number of reasons. I personally believe that could be one of 2 things. Or even both. 

1. Hedge funds selling off other portions of their portfolios to cover potential losses and keep GME price down long enough hoping people get bored and sell.

2. All of us retards selling off our other stocks just to put it all right into GME.

I guess I could be wrong but the fact that GME is able to go positive on a miserable market day like today changed the whole game for me. I don’t care if you were here in December or if today is your first day. Whether you think GME is a massive squeeze prospect or a down the road long play, now is the time to buy. The time to sell is when you are happy with the gains. I can’t stand when dates are given. Let’s be honest, no one fucking knows. What we do know is that this is likely about to be the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind. I believe that both of those reasons listed above are why this is happening. I’d love some input so drop it down below and maybe we can talk ape to ape.

TL;DR - Things are starting to line up and I’m gonna YOLO the fuck out of GME til my nuts fall off. As always, do WHATEVER THE FUCK.. you wanna do.",Ok Listen Up GME Retards - I Realized Something Today,0.8,1614896599,jaypx21

76,lxxd4r,"Gather 'round the fire kiddos, tomorrow is going to be lit. 

(NOT investment advice. Positions: 3000 shares + 100 3/19 $30c)

Tomorrow is the day that $RKT shorts die. If you haven't read any of the dd, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/).

Long story short, Jay ""Rocketcock"" Farner is about to dick slap Lord Farquaad out of this dimension during the trading day tomorrow. $RKT has a special dividend coming up of [$1.11 per share](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rocket-companies-q4-net-income-surges-declares-special-dividend-of-%241.11-shr-2021-02-25#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20declared%20a,distributions%20of%20about%20%242.2%20billion.). The record date is March 9th, and the ex-dividend date is March 8. For the autists around the fire who haven't figured out T+2 yet, this means if you want the special dividend you need to buy your shares by the end of the day tomorrow.

Before Vlad Tenev enters the chat and starts screeching about how the stock price will adjust down $1.11 the day of the dividend, let me just say **I don't give a single fuck**. It doesn't matter. Any shorts that do not cover tomorrow will *have* to pay $1.11/share out of pocket to keep their position open. Imagine you have a boatload of shorts that you purchased at $20, you're down 35% on them, and if you don't close **tomorrow** you are going to have to pay another 5.5% cash out of pocket on top of insane borrowing rates. They will close out, and if they want to short the stock they will probably make a nice profit next week piling back on after the record date.  

""But dad, if it is going to fall next week I'll lose money!""

Again, this is not investment advice. I am most certainly packing some powerful autismo in my jeans.  

Operation Starship SN10 will be in play tomorrow (Hi Elon!). Any astronaut worth his salt will load his precious tendies up and watch $RKT do what it was designed to do. When things settle down in the afternoon, be sure to unload the cargo before the [inevitable happens.](https://videos.space.com/m/yBjqWbrR/spacex-starship-sn10-explodes-shortly-after-landing?list=9wzCTV4g)",$RKT Man: Burning Out His Fuse All Up Here Alone,0.81,1614897391,oatmealcreampie

If the bond market is allowed to continue, it’s going to take the entire stock market with it. However bonds are really the only source of dollar confidence left. If the Fed turns bonds into a zombie market then the market will stabilize, probably even make a good jump up. But it won’t matter because the dollar would be done for and it doesn’t matter how high the stock market goes if the dollars don’t buy anything.

However they could let the market crash and do nothing. If that is the case the current batch of politicians and people viewed as “leaders” in our country would be guaranteed to be gone in their next elections because they “did nothing about it.”
