Dug a little deeper and there seems to be some behind the scenes momentum building coupled with some big names recently buying in.  Recommend the read if you're interested in small cap stocks with a strong buy rating and a ""high"" projected EPS announcement in the coming weeks.  I like this stock for a short term options play.

92,lww4vr,"Trading halted this morning for $MIK - Michaels Stores - this is the store Etsy sellers go to buy stuff to make their crafts.

Buyout news was announced that Apollo Group will buy them out for $22 a share - trading resumed just now and currently trading at $22.

QUESTION: Is it a no brainer to buy a TON of shares NOW at the current $22-ish  price range because if they find a buyer willing to pay higher within 25 days - then it's time to buy a new yacht ??  
Is there even a risk this stock will drop below $22 after this announcement???

The go-shop period is 25 calendar days, commencing today. Michaels will have the right to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal subject to the conditions and procedures specified in the merger agreement.
