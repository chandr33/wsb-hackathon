0,m2a5m4,"I had some money in my Public account, and was looking to move it over to my Schwabb account so it was all in one place. I had some GME on there from weeks ago that I had bought at ~$250 a share, so I was excited to sell it, and rebuy it so that it was all on one account.

I set up a [sell option on my Public account at 7:51](https://imgur.com/2wcpLPO) this morning for 11 shares at $320 a share. GME was at 295 at that point and growing, so I figured if it hit $320, it would trigger the sale, and once I got the notification, I'd buy on the Scwabb to move it over.

At 8:35am, GME passed $320 a share, and stayed above $320 a share for over a half hour, reaching over $344 a share at 9:15am. Then the strange market collapse happened. 20 minutes after that collapse, [I get a notification from Public that they sold my 11 shares, but sold them for $184.25](https://imgur.com/EZtwTMi).

65,m2afku,"Looking at US CPI report, China‚Äôs PPI and CPI report,  and the treasury offering this week. Yield spike beginning to look more like drama.

With CPI reported in line with expectation, or slightly below within some sectors, it does indicate that inflationary pressure is likely temporary and is driven by supply and logistic disruption due to the pandemic. In addition, with China PPI reported in line or slightly higher while core CPI was also slightly under expectation, further add to the idea of a temporary inflation driven by supply-logistic disruption.

US treasury 10 year offering today went well, with over $2.7 bid per dollar offered. And foreign interest bounded back to over 58%, just slightly below high.  

Its looking more and more likely that the recent yield spike is caused by dramatized media covering of the bad auction of the 7-year bills few week ago. Looking at the today and yesterday‚Äôs auction result, the demand is strong, and that‚Äôs taking into account that USD has declined about after a 8-9%. 

The reality is that the giant global government bond market has no better choice. US , is practically the only one issued by developed country that still has a positive rate. So there are only 3 options: safe bonds with negative rate, risky bonds with positive rate, or US bills which is safe but dismal positive rate. The reality is that, at the moment, US bills offering is still seem as the best out of a basket of crappy choices.","Looking at US CPI report, China‚Äôs PPI and CPI report, and the treasury offering this week.

77,m2agu7,"**TL;DR**

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of the trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

Iqiyi is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the Netflix of China, it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but Iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

Iqiyi is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years
*It has just closed at the very top of that range.
*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range. Trading ranges do continue more than they change, but it's hard to see that happening now.",Iqiyi ($IQ) - the Netflix of China - poised to soar - TSLA all over again,1.0,1615414531,Charlielarch

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, I was up to $11K in the first hour of market open, but that dwindled away fast as the sideways movement yesterday killed the premium on the options. I was glued to my screen, and watched as each minute my balance fell more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mazqce0hy9m61.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28521c6e3a025872a7794ac6903df4c0727f6041

&amp;#x200B;

Then today, I was initially down in the morning just for a minute but suddenly, things picked up big time. At 11:00AM, **I was up $32,000.00.** I currently owe about twice that in student loans, and I told myself I wouldn't sell until the options were worth what I owed in student loans (I refinanced my loans so they are now privately held, and thus I have no hope for forgiveness).   


Then, the GME drop and halts happened.   


My $32,000.00 dropped to next to nothing in minutes.   


While a strike price of 500 for Friday is... doable, it's pretty fucking risky at this point. And with each passing day, the option premium drops significantly (theta at one point was like -4.2).   


So, I waited a tiny bit  after the batch of halts (I was basically gambling yet again), and the options were finally about double the price I originally paid. I didn't want to be a slaughtered pig, and rather than focus on the $32,000.00 I missed out on, I realized I should be fucking happy I was able to get out with over $5,000.00 in profit.

**TL;DR: I don't have diamond hands, but I'm not ashamed.** I also am proud that my trade didn't have an impact on the hard work all you apes are doing in holding shares (since they are options contracts). Of course, it would've been great if I held and then they become ITM on Friday, but I'll take a $5K win over a $6K loss anyday.","My $6,000.00 YOLO on 3/12 GME 500 calls: at least I made a profit",1.0,1615414652,phillythompson
