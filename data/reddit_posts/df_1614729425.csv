59,lwgbju,"Ok you apes, I know everyone is probably distracted by the rest of the shit going on in the market but GO just had their earnings call today 3/2 and they fucking crushed it. In typical fashion what happened? the stock TANKS all the way down to $34 which is an INSANE VALUE. This stick was a bargain around 37-38 but now it's just free money when this thing rebounds back to 45 where it was less than a month ago.

Here are the highlights of the earnings call today in case you missed it:

* Net sales increased by 23.1% to $806.8 million, which includes $53.3 million from the 53rd week.
* Comparable store sales increased by 7.9% on a 13-week basis over a 5.1% increase in the same period last year.
* The Company opened eight new stores ending the quarter with 380 stores in six states.
* Net income increased 146.8% to $24.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 46.1% to $24.2 million, or $0.24 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 24.7% to $51.2 million.

This is all good news for us and only proves that after the sell off after earnings this thing is going TO THE FUCKING MOON!üöÄ

Here are some highlights from 2020 compared to 2019:

* Net sales increased by 22.5% to $3.13 billion.
* Comparable store sales increased by 12.7% on a 52-week basis compared to a 5.2% increase in the comparable period last year.
* The Company opened 35 new stores and closed two stores during the year.
* Net income increased 592.1% to $106.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 86.9% to $112.7 million, or $1.14 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 32.4% to $222.9 million.

AND if that wasn't good enough here is what things are looking like moving forward for us.The Company currently expects to open between 36 and 38 stores this year with one closure. They anticipate that comparable sales for the first quarter will decline in the negative high-single digits reflecting the impact of cycling the initial demand surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Excluding the impact of discrete items, they anticipates a normalized fiscal 2021 tax rate of 28%.apital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are estimated to be approximately $130.0 million.

This is an extremely cyclical stock and moving into spring and summer are the biggest months for GO as cooking and overall grocery shopping increases. I can't overstate how undervalued they are right now at $34 and the calls are DIRT CHEAP.

Positions or GFTO: 

 3/19 40$ Calls - 35

4/16 40$ calls - 50

6/16 40$ calls - 50

I know march 19th seems soon but this thing is going to rebound very quickly with the rest of the market and they are so cheap I couldn't pass them up. WE WILL see $45 by the end of March, I am NOT  financial analyst, I eat crayons with a straw, please do your own DD.

62,lwgbtr,"Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. 

**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)

**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**... 

**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**

Here is why my fellow tards,

1) **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote ""**Lackluster day**"" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!

2) **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **""GAMMA SQUEEZE"" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.** 

3) The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. 

SOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. 

*Processing img v59kaj2xapk61...*

**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)** 

4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.

5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:** 

\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.** 

**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a ""NEW SQUEEZE RKT"" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding.

First semi real post here so bare with me. I‚Äôve noticed a trend between the last few days and the GameStop saga. I‚Äôm not sure if it will play out the same way but from my (recent) memory some of this set up seems familiar. 

1. Trade volume. Looked back at GameStop the two days prior to moon day (1/28), there was significantly higher volume. Today we saw even higher volume all within a single day. Not sure if there is any correlation but the lead up volumes seem to be similar. 
2. Broader market. I haven‚Äôt checked every ticket but I did notice that everything I‚Äôm tracking and a few other I spot checked were all down today. If memory serves correct, everything was down the day before  1/28
3. Hype. I never really saw what happened with that weed stock that gained momentum a week or two ago (I took a little time off after GME), but it seemed like it came and went before I noticed.

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert &amp; Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&amp;#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&amp;#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45. (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&amp;#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&amp;#x200B;

My PT is $73.5. NO üßªüëê

The market is still indecisive as we found out today, but that may have no impact on MARA. If we take a look at the chart below, notice that the volume is squeezing; yet there are still big moves each day due to volatility.  This explains two things:    
1. MARA is volatile   
2. When volume breaks out, it will go ballistic.    


Take a look at the last two bounces off support (circled in green). This should tell you that MARA typically pumps FAST and drops slowly, when there is a breakout on volume that is.   


Back to where we stand.. we have bounced off support, but volume has not spiked and we aren't moving like we do in the previous bounces.    


From all of this info, expect to possibly touch that support one last time before we blast off; otherwise, this is a small pullback in the process of taking off. In conclusion: Take an entry when you see the volume spike.. simple as that.     


And always, before entering a trade, be sure to check recent news to give yourself support and a sturdy wall to stand behind.

If the price dips further than your strikes then you sell using your put and you‚Äôve lost nothing and can keep using the strategy until it bottoms.

After the price rebounds you hold the security and let your put expire to profit.

This seems like a zero risk long bull strategy. Is there an easier way to do this I‚Äôm missing, or risk I‚Äôm not understanding?
