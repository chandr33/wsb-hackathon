Revenue rose 18.9%, while gross profit grew nearly 52%, as strong demand for UMC's 28-nanometer chips pushed profits higher. Shares are up an eye-watering 240% in the last year, but compared to larger competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), UMC still looks cheap.

55,m3ex7z,"Honestly I don´t trust Cohen´s tweets cause I simply don´t trust Cohen.

Let´s resume:

Cohen´s tweets look like Roaring Kittie tweets, misterious and funny, and the stocks are in fact responding to his tweets, always going up.

Plotkin was an ex employer and protégé of Cohen and don´t forget that  his company Point72 Asset Management and Citadel invested $2.75bn funds for Plotkins hedge fund, Melvin Capital, in the first squeeze and they both said that this money can be managed by Plotkin without any question. "" in a rare move that sees two industry titans help a smaller rival"".

Plotkin said in the federal court that he had liquidated all the shorts that his company had in Gamestop, no one believes but he said it, again in a federal court.

I know that Cohen will have an important role play in Gamestop but why? This fact is quite important cause if you borrow tons of money to your protégé you would expect to be paid. Or he went to Gamestop board to manage the whole situation? Damage control?

Please let me know your toughts, I am just a smooth brain that likes the stock.

Its inspirational to see that you guys, who are strangers to each other, nonetheless are joining together into an unmovable force. 

Now this....is unity.


I am a person with a hope, in thinking of doing the impossible in creating a startup and forming a team on Reddit to create a universe almost like OASIS from ready player one. 
Except the death = lose all part.

3D INTERNET HUB !  For PC, Console, Mobile, VR

Create your Own Reality in a Million Worlds. 
Be yourself in a Universe where anything is possible. From realistic to animation!

Imagine walking inside your favourite anime world, literally!

Ok you’re not into anime, no problem. 

Sitting on the floor in your room, you are also sitting on virtual sandy beach on a planet while your custom spaceship is cooling down in the distance.

Walking in your house before its built, see sunlight pass through the windows and light up the room.
This is here guys! The tech is here. 
Look at minecraft ray tracing.

// What a virtual universe would change
-Virtual Global Classrooms

Realistic 3D shopping? with 3D scanned products.

-No screen limit (Be like IronMan w holograms in VR).
-Decentralised, like the internet.
-Visit user made planets &amp; space empires
-Import Any 3d models
-Add an Ai friend like jarvis

A physics game engine will be the foundation of the universe but it can be modded for the your game or world settings.

New user enters the main planet (which is split in different districts to avoid server crash).

⁠'server overload' is a solved technical problem.

We don't use single machines for servers anymore, haven't for 15 years, we use server farms.  
We have 'front end' machines that handle the connection between you and the outside world (and encryption, for example, which is computationally expensive), we have database servers where all they handle is writing your character information to a database and then reading it out, we have 'zone' servers that handle all of the characters in a specific part of the world - and these days we can even dynamically split them up at run time AND we can 'shard' or 'instance' them dynamically - we have separate servers used just for AI, or for physics, or voice chat, or text chat, or for rendering your character's head shots, or for doing ray cast collision checks..  

Basically - we can split up the server into as many processes as needed, and buy as much hardware as we need to, to be able to run just about anything imaginable.  

If you're worried about latency across the world, you can build servers in different data centers on different continents - though this generally means that people won't be able to interact across them or you have to deal with the latency.

I don’t think its really necessary to make a compelling ""OASIS-like"" experience.  

Plus, if we start working on it now, and if we are smart, then we’ll just build in support to expand into new interfaces as they become available... because I can tell you with certainty that whatever we think it's going to be like right now is going to change over the next 10 years. 

We had the luck of being able to see and experience demos for a huge variety of hardware, and it's incredibly compelling and at the same time feels like its years away from being ready for a mass market.  We also already have to support Oculus, Vive, and 'Windows Mixed Reality' devices in a variety of video resolutions, on a variety of hardware, with a variety of controllers, probably allowing for both seated and room-scale VR - AND we’ll probably support non-VR experiences initially to gain users.

It is easier to create non-VR first then turn it into VR as then we can include more people.

I've seen a fair few posts about when to sell and people being worried about if it's going to keep going up.

No one knows right?

Wrong DFV knows. 

He is right about everything and is the only technical analysis needed, from posting screenshots of his postions right from the start, to not selling during the first squeeze and then doubling down. All has been open for us to see and decide whether or not it's worth the risk. If you look at his comments there's even an erie message where he says January 2021 in response to a comment about when it's all going to take off months ago. He's right about everything.

As it would appear that he's either psychic or a time traveller, and therefore I trust what he posts to then make my own decision about where GME is going. Gathering some of you can read then you know that he has a call expiring on April 16th. Based on everything up until now. I would predict that that is when the party is over. Some time after earnings is when I think it will skyrocket for a couple of weeks and then slowly or quickly dip back to a normal level by mid April. DFV might then keep holding onto his shares as it seems he's long. But if you want to get off at the moon and not come back I'd get off before that contract expires. 

However, this is GME. Maybe no one ever sells and it stays at $1,000s for years.
