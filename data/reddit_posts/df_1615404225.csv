I apologize for paperhanding 11 GME stocks from a side account I didn't want to close.  I have since bought back in at a considerable loss.  I went from 11 @ \~$124 to a nice 8 @ $264 average.  Side note:  I still hold 40 @ 150 in my primary account.

At any rate, I also promised that if GME hit 400 (which I'm sure it will), I would open a pickle business.  Since I work in the public, I don't want to dox this account (so I'm not putting my name out there), but I will have everyone know that I have registered my LLC with the state, I have obtained my food production permit, I have secured a logo and website for marketing, and I will be offering my pickles on the market in CY 2021.  I'm also adding in virtual and in-person cooking classes for anyone interested. 

It isn't easy putting yourself out there to try something new, but the idea of all of us going all in on GME gave me the push to try something new, to follow my passion.  All of my profits are going to support local charities.

Thanks for the wild ride so far.  Sorry for buckling for a moment, but I'm back in again, ready for MOON!

Here's my pickled jalapenos and garlic, about to made into a pineapple ginger salsa.  Great for banana dipping.

32,m263j5,"In this post, I will present evidence to support my thesis that we are in the infancy of the largest economic expansion in modern US history since the period immediately following the Great Depression. I will touch upon US monetary policy, politics, treasury bonds, and the equities market in broad terms, and only as they relate directly to this thesis.

First, we will examine economic metrics which illustrate the magnitude of the Great Depression, and how they compare with the present day COVID-19 pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

  **US Unemployment Rate from 1890 – 2020**

[Figure 1. Source: Washington Post \(Unemployment rate jumps to 14.7 percent, the worst since the Great Depression - The Washington Post\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ca83kww19m61.jpg?width=844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86045b9cccaf138fb68b08ccab0510e1232333a0)

&amp;#x200B;

**Annual Growth of Real GDP in the US from 1930 – 2020** 

*Processing img mbkd19n129m61...*

&amp;#x200B;

These two charts and metrics alone cannot express the nature of despair faced by the US during the Great Depression, which persisted for a full decade. Entire textbooks are dedicated to this topic, large portions of which are mandatory reading as part of the US public school curriculum.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) is a link to the Wikipedia page for the Great Depression if you want to learn more.

The Great Depression caused economic ripples across the world and became a cautionary chapter in US economic history. Since then, numerous US federal economic policies have been put in place to soften volatility and prevent another economic depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Deal:**

What followed the Great Depression was the largest economic expansion in US history, with annual real GDP growth reaching almost 20% in the early 1940s (figure 1). This growth is attributed primarily by historians to the policies enacted under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which are referred to collectively as “The New Deal.” The New Deal was essentially a massive federal stimulus which included things like the formation of the FDIC, SEC, mortgage relief programs, social security, public infrastructure projects, national park expansions, and many other policies intended to put Americans back to work. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) is a link to the Wikipedia page for “The New Deal” if you want to learn more. 

In contrast to The New Deal, were the policies enacted by President Herbert Hoover, prior to FDR entering office. President Hoover’s policies are generally perceived by historians as underwhelming, ineffective or poorly coordinated, giving rise to the memorable term “Hooverville.” Contributing to Hoover’s blunted policies were a divisive US political climate, with many at the time of Hoover’s presidency characterizing government stimulus as “free handouts.” These Hoover policy failures set the stage for FDR to enact the New Deal with very little resistance, rescuing the US economy from the Great Depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 and Present Day America:**

Fast forward to April of 2020, where US unemployment rate spikes to 14.7% (figure 1), the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans are out of work, so the US government dusts off the medicine cabinet of economic prophylaxis in the form of federal stimulus.  Within a matter of months, the Federal Reserve drops interest rates to the lowest value in American history, and the US government issues direct deposit stimulus payments to Americans. While these stimulus policies are enacted relatively quickly when compared with the Great Depression era, divisive political rhetoric still permeates US politics, with many calling the COVID-19 stimulus measures “free handouts.”

In early 2021, Donald Trump loses presidential re-election to Joe Biden, and the Republican Senate majority is reduced to a 50-50 split, with Vice-President Kamala Harris as the democratic tiebreaker.  

Within two months of taking office, President Joe Biden’s Congress passes another set of federal stimulus policies, totaling $1.9T. When added to stimulus measures passed by the Trump administration, the US has now received the greatest economic stimulus since The Great Depression.   
 Once considered overly optimistic, President Biden’s agenda of domestic infrastructure projects, technological development, and energy innovation now seem imminent; setting the stage for the largest US economic expansion since “The New Deal.”
