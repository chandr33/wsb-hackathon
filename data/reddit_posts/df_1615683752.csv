15,m4kam9,"I don't normally like these ""options for dummies"" kinds of posts and absolutely don't like seeing them but I keep seeing people try to make a stupid person's guide to how options work and being **really irresponsible** about explaining theta. I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.

Real quick:

* Not a pro
* Not investment advice
* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit

If you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.

Okay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.

# Theta

 The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. 

Theta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.

# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.

You dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.optiontradingtips.com\/greeks\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)

 Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

# Theta will eat your lunch

Last week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...

# Retard/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here

You live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, ""**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**"" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.

This is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.

Do you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.

* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers / dog walkers / high school teachers
* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors
* If someone tells you they're not a pro/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.
* Read a book motherfucker

FD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  


Good luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read.",Theta: God of Time and Death,0.98,1615684128,TheUltraViolence
