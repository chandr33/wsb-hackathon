9,m0n1fr,"Lately I’ve been reading a lot about UWMC and its fundamentals, earnings, ceo, etc. I wont get into it too much because theres a shitload of other DDs. In a nutshell the CEO is cutting off brokers who work with Rocket and it seems as though most brokers are siding with UWM. 2020 earnings shattered pre-covid 2019 earnings. 0.10c dividend coming up. So I’ve seen a lot of posts saying it should have gone up today and obviously it’s tanking while GME is soaaring up (hold the line 🦍🌽🚀🌙) and I was wondering if it has to do with the dividend date coming up. Some people say its today some people say it’s tomorrow regardless I’m starting to think hedgies are trying to get it as cheap as possible right before the dividend date. The stock is shorted up the ass and there are no more shares left to short which is insane to me. Should I YOLO this as I could easily see a squeeze happening or am I just actually autistic.

40,m0n6z0,"I use Quantitative Analysis and pattern behavior interrogation, sprinkled with more math. 

I've predicted the SNDL bubble that popped last month and EVERY GME parabolic event since it rose to $400+. Review my posts if validation is required. 

**The GME Theory**

This is advice based on proven data. I encourage anyone who wants to reinforce their opinion to review the last 10 days of GME parabolic behavior. I've included a few screenshots.

Why am I sharing? Because I like bananas and know others do as well. Good luck, and ensure you have limits set!

**Now to the theory:** 

**Conditions:**

**RSI: 70+**

**5 x 1min Green Candle, 6th Green Candle is the tip/dip.**

**RSI - will dump to roughly 50 RSI as a recovery floor.**

An indicator of a parabolic event is triggered with a sudden rise towards 70 RSI, or it peaks with the first green candle at 1minute. The event will last for 5 green candle rises and will tip at the 6th. Red candles can occur; that is, sell limits and paper hands dumping. No worries, the power behind GME's parabolic behavior is consistent, and the 5th green is where the high will peak, and on the 6th green candle, it will tip/dip.

""They targeted gamers.

&amp;#x200B;

Gamers.

&amp;#x200B;

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll punish ourselves doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll spend most (if not all) of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

&amp;#x200B;

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems overheated, disks and cartridges destroyed in frustration? All to later be referred to as bragging rights?

&amp;#x200B;

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money elsewhere, or even making the games ourselves. They think calling us racist, misogynistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty headset. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

&amp;#x200B;

Gamers are competitive and hardcore by nature. We love a challenge. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challenge us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first, you're not the biggest, and you're certainly not the baddest; this is just another boss fight..

81,m0nd9z,"Alright fellow simians, I am hoping we are evolving enough to where we can begin talking specifics in terms of the options market on our beloved AMC. I know many are hesitant, fearing that if specific prices aren't reached by Friday, younger apes in the pack may grow scared and begin to doubt our journey. I am hoping by now we have done enough research on the market itself to now understand specific pricing goals and not be discouraged by them if the week doesn't go as planned.

TLDR: If you are like me and data makes your snake hiss, or your cat growl for my ape sisters, stick around. If you're going to pout and take your ball home if we happen to miss a target price come friday, GTFOH...Sorry for yelling, I still love you, (bro hug).

Alright so as a nerd at heart a good spread sheet to me can beat a free premium pornhub account especially when it's a spreadsheet about boosting our AMC and speeding up the count down to our moon launch.

As you should all know, the options market and corresponding weekly Gamma squeezes will help push our rocket towards the launch pad much quicker than just the buy and hold campaign. Now, options are a different breed and can burn young gun apes bad so I am not suggesting playing ""just the tip"" with them if you do not fully understand the risk. Think playing said game with a cigar cutter...

Anyways, options have huge impact on stock price as each contract is for 100 shares. So the more contracts that are sold by market makers, the more 100x shares they must purchase the following monday at market price if the contracts are exercised. This is the foundation of Gamma. If you're not tracking and want to learn more, please reach out. Seriously, I'm not a weirdo, I'm not offering you free candy out of a sketchy van, I just know that the smarter our pack gets and learns the game, the worse it is for the Hedge Fucks. I am not an advisor, so I will not and do not give advice, but I will give information and hypotheticals for my ape brothers and sisters to make their own decisions.

In an earlier post this weekend I commented on how absurd (good thing) the options game is right now on AMC. AMC is now has the 11th most active options contracts. Yes, AMC, movie theaters. If you don't get why that is unfucking believable you must have been fortunate enough to be in a coma during the wet fart on first date of a year that was 2020 thanks to the rona.

Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Now at a strike of 8, if market prices is at or above 8.79 the number of options ITM is 27,688 or 2,768,800 shares at stake... how would you feel about that if you were shorted on AMC? Personally, I'd be curled up under my desk crysterbating while sucking my other thumb...

Below is a table I made listing the price at which options are ATM and the number of contracts that would be ATM or ITM at strikes below these are for all contracts sold expiring Friday (3/12):

Now sharing this info is meant to help shareholders know the power of the options game and keeping the weekly monday Gamma pump going. I haven't done the research for this past friday. But the 8.01 buzzer beater that left me needing to change my jocks two weeks ago gave us a 14.5% pump that following monday.

""But why then are we still hovering around 8?!?! I want more and I want it now! Wahhh!""

Well that's because the HFs still had ladder attack power to push things back down by week's end. You beloved apes buying more stonk and holding it is taking that power away slowly. The less shares they have for ladder attack bullshit the more/longer that monday gamma pump will hold.

As you can see above, things are good at almost any price above 8. But the 8 dollar call had a 10,000+ increase in the number of contracts sold at that strike last week compared to the week prior, hence the more than double resulting power compared to 8.38 (which is an 8 call sold a while back at a premium of .38 a share)

So for me personally, and not advising anyone to bandwagon, I'm going to be cheering for 8.80 at Friday's close so those 27,688 contracts containing 2,768,800 shares are ITM.

But even if it doesn't quite make it, I'll still have a smile ear to ear as I know the options ITM below are still pretty damn powerful in the fight against douche bags like Gabriel Plotkin and the rest of the Hedge Fucks...",Options game on AMC is insane!,1.0,1615230662,Abuck71588
