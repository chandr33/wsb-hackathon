There's a shitload of jargon involved with options strategies, I have no idea why.  The math is middle school level. I guess they're to keep us 🦍 away with intimidating names like ""Iron Condor."" They even label strategies that involve purchasing more than 2 things as ""advanced.""  Just another futile attempt by the hedgies to keep people out of their business.

You can learn all this stuff in maybe **10 minutes** with payoff diagrams.  Sure, you probably won't be able to memorize the names of the dozens of strategies but that shits for nerds anyway.

# Quick Overview

**Bullish** means you think the value of an equity will go up, and **going long** means you've taken a position that will profit based on that assumption.  **Bearish** and **going short** are the opposite.  Note that these are positions and not actions.

**Buying** and **selling** are actions.  They are not related to positions.  Here's why:

* Buying the asset -&gt; long position
* Selling the asset (borrowed) -&gt; short position
* Buying a call -&gt; long position
* Selling a call -&gt; short position
* *Buying a put -&gt; short position*
* *Selling a put -&gt; long position*

Oh shit those last two switched it up.  Buying and selling can be thought of as ""multiply by 1"" and ""multiply by -1"" respectively.  If you have a contract and you sell it, you just reversed whatever position owning the contract would be in.

# Get the crayons out

Let's look at some payout diagrams.  They show what your profit will be at different price points for the **underlying asset**.  Let's assume we're dealing with a stock that is **$12 today**.

The easiest payouts to draw are for owning (going long) the underlying asset and selling (shorting) the asset:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3j2g3mq1y7n61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4469fc639767d91e88f17a90a2d9a357bd11c87

Calls and puts are similar to owning and selling the asset, but the downside is limited and the upside is offset (by the premium):

&amp;#x200B;

[Note that you don't profit until the price moves](https://preview.redd.it/rne1swz5y7n61.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8231ee6e4d5c9efd1d01c73a325e4a49ed65a6d5)

(@ pedantic nerds: Yea I know I'm drawing this as if you can buy individual calls/puts. In reality you have to buy bundles of 100.  Just scale that shit in your head, it turns out to be the same.)

What happens if we *sell* calls and puts?  Easy, we just multiply by -1 (flip them over):

&amp;#x200B;

[Unlimited downside if you're selling calls...](https://preview.redd.it/bg88qmgey7n61.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1311788105ae0385520f6a29ceddb5e799f42762)

Now we have all the tools needed to blow our money on stupid bets.  Real quick let's go over how to combine them.

# What happens if you do more than one thing?

Ooh lala.

Let's say you own the underlying equity and buy a put option:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/21auvuyxx7n61.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df6d07931f7954344010b8b40a502904116b6c35

Now the downside is limited! But we shifted the upside down by the price of the put (in this case, 1 dollar).

How did I draw this diagram?  I took the original payoff diagrams and **added their slopes**. That's the crux of it, if you can see that the slope of a strategy is -1 (downward) and the other 1 (upward), then adding them makes it zero (flat).  If the slope of one line is 0 (flat), you can just ignore it.  That gives us the new slopes, but doesn't explain how the graph got shifted down.  To find the offsets (how much it's shifted down or up), you **calculate the payoff at** ***one*** **particular price**.  In this case we can see at price $12 we've paid 1 dollar for the put and would profit zero from owning the underlying, so the profit at $12 is $-1. You can double check at other prices, but it's *good enough to just calculate* ***one*** *of them*.

Broken down:

# Hang on, that's the same as a call

If you look closely, you'll notice this is the exact same payout as a call.  So what did the big whigs at the finance companies name this strategy? A ""synthetic call.""  This is common in options strategies -- same shapes with different underlying instrumentation and different names.  It's annoying as hell because these names are not usually so obvious.  Like a ""bull call spread"" is the same shape as ""collar"" but the name collar only describes the shape and not the strategy itself (which involves owning the underlying).  I found a good site that explains all of them here: [https://www.chittorgarh.com/newportal/options-trading-startegies.asp](https://www.chittorgarh.com/newportal/options-trading-startegies.asp) It also lets you do side by side comparison.

# Another example

Let's say you buy an in the money (ITM) call (strike price $10) and sell and out of the money (OTM) call (strike price $13)

You get the aforementioned bull call spread:

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this has given you enough information to draw a shape and then figure out a strategy that might create that shape.  It's pretty easy because there are only a couple shapes, but you can get really crazy with it.

61,m5p7de,"Investopedia says that the fee to borrow shares is determined by the difficulty of getting shares to borrow. In theory, if everyone turns off share lending in their brokerage accounts by using cash accounts instead of margin or disabling it in app settings, this fee should go up and it becomes harder to borrow to short. I think that its become so low because retail investors with share lending turned on, now own a large chunk of the float and therefore its easy to borrow those shares.

Turning off share lending should also recall your shares if they've been borrowed and sold short and this would force shorts to close involuntarily.

**The only way to win this battle against the hedge funds is to cut off their ability to short the stock so cheaply.** If they can short the stock for *virtually* free, dollar-for-dollar, against retail traders, this squeeze will never get squoze.

**TLDR:** Switch your $GME-holding brokerage account to a cash account. Collectively force the hedge funds pay a much larger premium to short the stock. Force them to cover.

RH Can only lend out shares in margin accounts so if you convert to a cash account they cannot lend out your shares.

**How to prevent this on RH:**

1. In the RH app (iPhone), Account Tab -&gt; Investing -&gt; Day Trade Settings -&gt; 'Turn Off Instant Settlement' to convert your margin account to a Cash account
2. Withdraw all of your leftover money/positions and put re-deposit it into a better brokerage. Because fuck RobinHood anyway.

**How to prevent this on Webull:**

You can opt-out on the Webull app under Settings --&gt; Account &amp; Security --&gt; Brokerage Account --&gt; More --&gt; Stock Lending Income Program --&gt; Exit
