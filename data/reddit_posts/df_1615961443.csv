Stocks with a P2E ratio well above the norm could be in for a rude awakening if Hedgies need to cover their GME losses. Maybe we start preparing ourselves for their price correction initiated by GME shorts being covered and the market taking a big knock?

What is a team in my understanding and how I see it - the image of an ideal!

1. a team of 3-5 people, this is the maximum.
2. all team members must be the same in temperament, character, ambition and other psycho-characteristics. This will help the participant quickly feel like a part of the team and quickly reach their potential. This point seems to me the most important!
3. all team members must share the same area of ​​analysis and trading decisions. By sphere, I do not mean a specific trading strategy, but a subsection to which it belongs. The narrower the sphere, the more effective the result and understanding within the team will be.
4. clear internal rules - working hours, money management, risk management, preferably the same capital of the participants.
5. it is desirable to work in one room, but this is certainly unlikely, but this is also a very important factor! That would thus exclude the analysis of the charts in the subway, or lying on the couch, or from a bottle of ""sedative"" after a difficult conversation with his wife.

27,m6u2km,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Here's why I'm dumping/have dumped MUCH of my money in to G EM EEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Forgive me for being a little long winded. I have been drinking a nice bottle of Bordeaux and holy bananas.

I believe that the stock market is the best opportunity maker the world has ever known. I have seen it's rewards personally, and I know many of you have as well. Over the past few months I have gone through many emotions. It began as - heh - who would invest in a bad decision like this. Foolish. I have since refined and clarified my position. I am a true believer in the FREE market system. What I do not believe in is when the market is not able to live up to it's promises. Everyone stands a chance, right? We have seen very clearly over the past few weeks how this  ""freedom"" and these chances can be taken away from us by those who are more powerful, manipulative, and `perhaps,` most likely criminal.

I have seen post after post from those of your APES (NERDS) in my language with some fantastic analysis. Some seems like is has been posted without opposable thumbs? The fact of the matter is there are some brilliant minds in this community. One which I am proud to finally be a member of.

I know that many of us are scared about what might happen next. I know from time to time I have felt that way too. What I do know for certain is this. Nobody should have the power to tell the ""voters"" what a company or it's stock should be OR is worth. They can ""believe"" what they like. They can even bet on it. But when manipulation gets involved - that's when people in my profession SHOULD be getting worried. We should be worried about our money. We should be worried about our clients money (circumstantially). But what do most of us do? We turn the blind eye. I have CHOSEN to do the opposite. I have committed and continue to commit to the cause. TO THE MOON!

Anyway onto why you might be actually reading this.

What I can tell you this this. If we HODL, and even buy more shares when we see the dips - we can still ""win"" this fight. Purchase in the money calls and if you're so willing to BUY shares at the same time - purchase just ""above"" the money calls. Make sure you consult with other apes you know first - because a LOT of us need to do this. VOLUME is the only thing that will keep this thing alive. We know the hedgies have a lot of volume to work with, but we got free money coming and they don't. SO USE IT (if you can - do not over extend or ever invest (in this) in what you cannot afford to lose). I'm taking my wife's and her boyfriends and it's going into G EM EEEEEEEEEE even if they DISAGREEEEEEE. To the moon my fellow homo sapiens.

Before sending anyone money

1. ask them to send you a screenshot by mail showing them logged into the subscription, with your dm visible in the same screenshot - proving that they really are subscribed to the service, and not just reselling you a point-in-time copy of the picks they received from someone else.
2. ask them to describe to you what they publish and how. Just knowing the picks for a portfolio is not at all enough. Subscriptions come with picks, updates, guidance, allocations, ranking, supporting articles through the year. Without that, you're just dead-in-the-water starting a portfolio without knowing where to take it a month later.
3. sign up for promo emails from MF. they'll send you promo emails of when new services are starting and even sometimes when their services have big updates baiting you into buying. something like ""round 1 of 10x is out. Last chance to subscribe"". Of course your not buying, but when those emails do reach you, you know that you should be getting an update from whoever you paid to share in. And if they don't publish timely updates, well...

By now we all know what a gamma squeeze is, and generally speaking we know the conditions under which it occurs. This post is intended to very ignorantly explore the degree to which $UWMC might be squozed.

# Hypothetical example:

Take the following example given the following assumptions:

There is only one institution making $UWMC's market

* This market maker only hedges their positions using derivatives of $UWMC and the underlying itself
* The MM is currently delta-neutral

Some Ape decides to buy some calls.

To be delta neutral after selling a call option, a market maker must own a certain number of shares equalling:  **Number of Contracts \* Delta \* 100.**

That is to say, if MM sells 10 OTM calls at time X with a 0.1 delta, they must buy 10 \* .1 \* 100 = 100 shares to be delta-neutral.

If the share price increases over time X + T such that those calls are now deep ITM, **and** the MM is still delta neutral **and** no other options activity took place, somewhere between time X and time T, the market maker must have necessarily purchased 900 additional shares.

It follows then, that the effect a market maker will have on price due to delta hedging is inversely related to the ratio of volume/float. **Simply put,** delta hedging has more of an effect on low-float, lower-liquidity names. 

&amp;#x200B;

**OK, where is the ape math for UWMC?**

Here it is:

What if UWMC were to hit $9? A potentially cascading effect:

The $9 and $10 calls would have a delta of \~53, and \~25 respectively, requiring MM's to purchase:

16,765 \* (.53-.34) \* 100 = 318,535 shares to be hedged on the $9's

38,823 \* (.25-.13) \* 100 = 465,875 shares to be hedged on the $10's

.... ect for the rest but I don't want to do the math. The number is bigger than 1M obvs. Someone else can do the math there's probly a tool for it but im hungry af and need to sleep. Multiply this by 3 and thats the MM hedging requirements for the next 3 options expiries. Delta curve its not the same but good enough for ape math. If it starts running it could go for a while, or it might not get enough steam.

Volume has been between average of 7M for the last 10 days, with a public float of 90M.

The potential is definitely there. I also like UWMC as a mortgage company because of the way they are. Pics below for reference.

I first bought AMC (first stocks ever bought by ape me) on february 1st, GME was a couple hundreds falling, and poor ape me saw about AMC...it was cheap enough, and we were going to the moon, or so I read, so I bought 35 shares at 15.76$. It closed that day at 13.30$. Tomorrow is the day people said. Didn´t sell.

February 2nd I bought 4 more for 9.86, and 70 more for 8.17$... it closed that day in 7.82$... so far so good (haha)...stock expert me ate 2 crayons and cried in bed, tomorrow is the day people said, and didn´t sell.

Next days continued falling. Tomorrow is the day people said...didn´t sell.

On February 9 I bought 50 more at 5.55$ and then another 51 at 5.47$... thinking in average the mess down, that day didn´t sell either. You know why? Because next day was the day, people said.

Next week or so the stock just MEH.. no up or downs, next day is the day people said, didn´t sell.

Februay 22nd and 23rd started rising, so on the 24th I bought 90 more shares at 7.17$, because that was the day, people said, didn´t sell.

Feb 26th we closed at 8.01$, next day is the big day, people said, so on March the 2nd I bought 200 more at 9.39$. Next day people said, didnt´sell.

March 10th started rising and I panicked bought 173 more, because that was the day, or so people said...didn´t sell...

Today... March the 16th I went all in, all my savings for another 389 more shares at 13.20, because you know... today was the day again... but it doesn´t matter what people say... I´m here and I.DON´T.SELL. And I won´t sell...because I TRUST YOU my fellows, and I watch the graph and the dd´s, and see that we were 5 dollars a month ago and today we closed at 13$ and I TRUST YOU MORE, YES. We are here, no matter what they say....on the ups and downs, suffering when it plummets, (not me anymore, I´m a vet!!!!) and happy when it raise, but this is just the beginning my dudes. Don´t listen to these bunch sad little trolls trying to put us apart...  WE.ARE.LEGION and we will prevail.

 This is not going to be tomorrow anymore... be patience... wining or losing, don´t think in the money ...we don´t have money anymore....now we **OWN STOCKS**...we **own part of a huge business that is getting back on its feet**... and this will rise.... be patience my apes... good things are coming. Just look at the graph, and don´t listen to the smoke sellers....we have plenty of them...just TRUST EACH OTHER...

Take care and be happy my dudes. I feel you.

 LOVE.
