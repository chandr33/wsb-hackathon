15,m2qtkf,"What if this ""yoyo"" movement in the stock is the ♾️ squeeze people were talking about.

Hear me out, and this is just one guy's theory, I'm not a financial advisor.

What if this stock will infinitely go up and down because hedgies don't see any value in it and each time their shorts or whatever have to be moved/covered/or reinitiated, will cause this stock go up, it will reach it's apex, or the one that the big money wants it to, then they cover/reopen new shorts and the process starts all over again.

If this is correct, than it means we may see another spike tomorrow and then it will fall back down. How low, hard to say but I think it'll land higher than last time. The reason is because on both sides, you have a line of stubborn and persistent people, with highly agressive wants causing it.

I'm sure some wrinkled brain here has data to back this up but I was zoomed out and looking at the peaks and was wondering, is this a replay of January and will this keep going on. 

In conclusion, I think as long as hedgies don't see any value in this stock and smooth brains won't move. This could go on, forever.

Ideally, you'd want to buy the dip and then close somewhere on the way up but to each their own.

For this wondering, I initially started with 16@$292 on January 28th and then averaged down to 190@$89.
Trailing stop loss kicked in for me around 277. If my theory is correct, I plan to buy back in under $200 and ride this yoyo back and forth until it won't.

I apologise, I started trading with this on January 28th and have been trying to absorb as much as I can so theres probably lots that Im missing but if someone could make DD or use this theory with some DD, it'd probably make more sense. Some graphs with lines and colors. Maybe pass out crayons to everyone before the DD, for snacks.

TL;DR

This yoyo effect is the infinity squeeze. Buy the dip, sell somewhere along the way and then start all over again each time having more buying power.","What if the ""infinity squeeze"" is real and this is what it looks like",0.44,1615471652,serrano786

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".
