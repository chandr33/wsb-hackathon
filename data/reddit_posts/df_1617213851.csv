0,mhbwxh," I'm going to start this by saying - I love what WSB did last year and into January. I fucking hate what commercial banks represent and shorting those hedge funds was fun and appropriate justice.

But this [u/willdams](https://www.reddit.com/u/willdams/) and ""officials"" in the wsb community are not and should not be supported for shit like this. I don't even know how I ended up in this Telegram group, but anyway, there I was this morning, getting \*pings\* to get ready for the ""Thursday, 17:00 pm GMT"" pump n' dump signal that is released on a coin that they specify to pump.

With morning coffee in hand, I sat back and watched as the PSG coin popped from 18.125USDT at 16:54 to peak at 21.273USDT at 16:55 then was already coming back down to 20.020USDT by the time 17:00 came about. From that point on it was a further fall to 17.874USDT by 17:03.

To summarize, if you had tried buying a pump n dump with the free signal WSB (@willdams) had provided you, you had 1 minute to get in at the max at 20.020 and sell at the max of 20.302 before it all came crashing back down. This is a guaranteed loss as this margin is so razor-thin.

The only way to get in on a ""pre-sell"" signal (2 minutes before) is to buy the VIP package. Buy the VIP+ package and you get the buy signal 5 minutes before. Now, I don't know what these packages cost, but based on these times on this mornings pumpndump, even the VIP package would have ended in a loss, and the VIP+ signal had still already pumped a minute prior to your signal when the guys who are coordinating this (@willdams) have already bought their share.

In other words, fuck these guys and their market manipulation. Stick to buying good projects and avoid the pump n dumps. These bad actors are the reason governments feel it is necessary to step in to protect people. I don't know how to shut it down from a community standpoint besides bringing awareness to it, and avoiding it at all costs.

\*Get rich quick schemes do not exist, it will probably go south faster than you can say i'manidiot\*

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a ‚Äúfour-year head start‚Äù** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.

# Big boys invested in ROOT

Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT‚Äôs market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT‚Äôs Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.

(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

The original bear argument was centered around $ROOT‚Äôs high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company‚Äôs Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT‚Äôs loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.

# Root 2021 Growth

Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**

‚ÄúWe were able to show strong growth despite the decisionto pull back onmarketing spend towards the end of the first quarterresulting from the globalpandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatoryuncertainty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe plan to more than double our sales and marketinginvestments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investmentin marketing fuels anaccelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.‚Äù

This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).

**Daily Downloads ‚Äì ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**

[Daily Downloads - ROOT vs. LMND](https://preview.redd.it/0gshrx0gneq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86265bbd79080f98fe26e83465f15865511d4f07)

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target

Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology and an ESG trend that is too strong to ignore.

""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

37,mhcb0z,"Heads up apes, Ubiquiti (ticker: UI) is about to take it up the tendie hole from shorts. They are a manufacturer of internet of things devices like routers, video recorders, and cameras. There was a security breach in January that was severely downplayed and suppressed, and now a whistleblower has alerted European regulatory bodies. From the article and another post on the system admin subreddit:

&gt;‚ÄúThe breach was massive, customer data was at risk, access to customers‚Äô devices deployed in corporations and homes around the world was at risk.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;**‚ÄúThey were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,‚Äù Adam said.**  
Such access could have allowed the intruders to remotely authenticate to countless Ubiquiti cloud-based devices around the world. According to its website, Ubiquiti has shipped more than 85 million devices that play a key role in networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

The money quote:

&gt;Adam says Ubiquiti‚Äôs security team picked up signals in late December 2020 that someone with administrative access had set up several Linux virtual machines that weren‚Äôt accounted for.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúUbiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances with networking connectivity to said databases,‚Äù Adam wrote in his letter. ‚ÄúLegal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes within the relevant period.‚Äù

[\^Article in question](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/)

And now, a law firm that specializes in securities litigation has just opened a case against them. [Article here.](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/shareholder-alert-ubiquiti-inc-investigated-184800904.html) Supposedly Ubiquiti was the real target in the AWS hack a while back. Anyone remember that story of a casino's mainframe being hacked [through a smart thermometer on a fishtank?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/21/how-a-fish-tank-helped-hack-a-casino/) Well, this is a hack that was apparently much more invasive (infiltrated all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies) and this is a company that manufactures *security cameras and routers*. If a smart thermometer could get dataframe access at a casino, imagine the damage that could be done here to any business with a Ubiquiti product hooked into their network. I'm not saying they haven't patched up a good portion of the breach, but at this point it's hard to tell what else might be compromised if they swept it under the rug this long. Anyone smoothbrains smarter than me please feel free to explain in more depth.

Ubiquiti has dropped 15% on the day and this news has not hit mainstream networks or media yet, just a system security blog and a small Yahoo Finance alert. If this gets any more publicity, or there is any major updates with he litigation, this thing might see a 50% drop like SolarWinds did during their hack which I expect to play out over next couple trading days into next week. 

Puts have gotten more expensive, but personally I'm in. Buying puts $240 Apr 16 and May 21. Companies that have this level of security incompetence and are this negligent towards their customers don't deserve to be valued like this.

However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company‚Äôs Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT‚Äôs loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.

# Root 2021 Growth

Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**

‚ÄúWe were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.‚Äù

This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target

Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology and an ESG trend that is too strong to ignore.

""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

# TLDR; $ROOT has a rare massive short squeeze opportunity.

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a ‚Äúfour-year head start‚Äù** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.

# Big boys invested in ROOT

Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT‚Äôs market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT‚Äôs Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.

(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.

Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don‚Äôt worry my fellow ape brethren I‚Äôve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let‚Äôs walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop‚Äôs transition.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

# Chapter 1: Gamestop‚Äôs Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Let‚Äôs start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431

And this is the key misstep the HF‚Äôs made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They‚Äôve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can‚Äôt easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it‚Äôs expensive). They can‚Äôt move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn‚Äôt owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it‚Äôs stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn‚Äôt bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.

Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.

# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092

So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he‚Äôs just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy‚Äôs online sales figures under Cohen to project what‚Äôs to come for Gamestop in the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e

That‚Äôs right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.

Gamestop Announced in it‚Äôs Q4 earnings report last week what it‚Äôs intentions are... *‚ÄúOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.‚Äù*

Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics &amp; Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...

&amp;#x200B;

# Chapter 3: Electronics &amp; Media Sales

If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it‚Äôs money. Look no further than the category of Electronics &amp; Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon‚Äôs market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723

Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it‚Äôs website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon‚Äôs growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn‚Äôt bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.

So let‚Äôs get to the fun part‚Ä¶ valuation

&amp;#x200B;

# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I‚Äôll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.

Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let‚Äôs look at the figures anyway and then I‚Äôll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it‚Äôs valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm‚Ä¶ why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop‚Äôs move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now‚Ä¶ it would move it‚Äôs price to approximately $5,157 a share. That‚Äôs not a squeeze number. That‚Äôs simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ipbngvoireq61...*

So let‚Äôs get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I‚Äôve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you‚Äôll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it‚Äôs P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You‚Äôll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it‚Äôs transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it‚Äôs online business, it‚Äôs P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Chapter: Conclusions

Ok you‚Äôve been patient, and I told you I‚Äôd eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn‚Äôt caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it‚Äôs deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?

Well **$191**, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs trading at. It‚Äôs only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don‚Äôt know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn‚Äôt buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It‚Äôs because of quality, and support for the brand.

Lots of things are increasing Gamestop‚Äôs valuation, but growth of it‚Äôs online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I‚Äôm giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop‚Äôs online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is‚Ä¶ an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics &amp; Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.

Project these figures onto Gamestop as you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it‚Äôs Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it‚Äôs finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it‚Äôs per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years‚Ä¶ Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you‚Äôre wondering how that‚Äôs possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another‚Ä¶

I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).

Here is a teaser‚Ä¶ When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it‚Äôs price north of $31,800 on it‚Äôs way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).

If you needed one more reason to HODL, it‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife‚Äôs boyfriend lost your password couldn‚Äôt get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.

And if you‚Äôve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects‚Ä¶ I think I figured it out

&amp;#x200B;

Please Be Good To Each Other Out There.

Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life.

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a ‚Äúfour-year head start‚Äù** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.

# Big boys invested in ROOT

Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT‚Äôs market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT‚Äôs Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.

(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

The original bear argument was centered around $ROOT‚Äôs high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company‚Äôs Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT‚Äôs loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.

# Root 2021 Growth

Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**

‚ÄúWe were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.‚Äù

This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).

**Daily Downloads ‚Äì ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily Downloads ‚Äì ROOT \(Green\) vs. LMND \(Blue\)](https://preview.redd.it/ruourewtreq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=673dd2afdb04c6097a4659c4690f30e51572c496)

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target

Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.

""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

This is what the emails states: 

‚Äú Dear Diemannschaft1, Apex Clearing Corporation (""Apex"") is notifying you about an upcoming amendment to the Apex Fully Paid Securities Lending Program (the ""Program"") in which you are currently enrolled. Pursuant to guidance published by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Apex is changing the method by which it maintains collateral in the program. Collateral for the fully-paid securities that you lend Apex will now be maintained in a custody account at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

By continuing your participation in the Program, you hereby agree to the amendments to Master Securities Lending Agreement between you and Apex. The updated Master Securities Lending Agreement and the Terms and Conditions to the Program are available for you to review here and will become effective as of April 22, 2021 (""Change Date""). Your account statement will continue to reflect any income you may receive from participating in the Program in the same manner to which you are accustomed. 

The Program changes will occur automatically and the way you interact with your account is not changing. If you no longer wish to participate in the Program, you must notify your broker prior to the Change Date in writing.

Sincerely,
Apex Clearing Corporation

 

Frequently asked questions regarding this change: 
What does this mean for my investment account?

Due to recent regulatory guidance, all broker-dealers who offer Fully Paid Securities Lending are making updates as needed to ensure compliance with the guidance. Accordingly, Apex will be changing how collateral is held when your securities are borrowed to better protect your interests. The way you interact with your account is not changing and there is no action required on your part.

What is changing in the Master Securities Lending Agreement (MSLA)?

Apex Clearing Corp will begin holding customer collateral in a collateral account at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Wilmington Trust will be the trustee for the account and charged with verifying collateral amounts posted to meet Apex obligations. End investors will see no changes to the program, eligibility, or income you may receive from lending securities.

When does this change take effect?

April 22nd, 2021

As an investor, do I have an account I can directly access with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.?

No, this account has been established for all investors enrolled in the FPSL program. While the funds from borrowed shares have been delivered to investors in compliance with the customer protection rule (Rule 15c3-3), this deposit is collateral held against securities on loan. The deposits from this account are only available in the event of a default or inability for Apex to return borrowed shares back to the investor.‚Äú
