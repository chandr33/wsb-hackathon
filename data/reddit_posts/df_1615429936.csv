JD has **Q4 earnings before market open tomorrow,** so we will see where we end up after price fluctuation.

I think someone noticed this pattern and decided to make a ton of money out of it by shorting the stock massively as it was getting close to 1pm. But damn that wasn‚Äôt a small sledgehammer. Got everyone spooked in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

So simply, there's a lender out there that feels like lending a stock (random example) that is currently at $10. A short seller thinks that stock is gonna do horribly and is probably actually worth $2.50. So the short seller borrows that stock, and sells it to Joe down the road for market price of $10. We wait and see that the seller was right, the stock is now worth $2.50 and is able to buy the stock at that price, returning it to the lender at $2.50 and pocketing the other $7.50.

Now what I don't get is why the lender or the buyer would want to take part in this deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the lender, (unless it's a stock that they're probably never going to sell, it could dip to 1 cent but they plan to hold on to it, so why not lend it for a bit of time) they lend a stock that's worth $10 and get the same stock returned, but now worth $2.50. Why do that when the lender could just sell it themselves for $10? Is it truly just people who never plan on selling that lend?

And Joe who buys the stock from the short seller, loses $7.50 value on that stock they just purchased from that seller. The seller obviously doesn't tell Joe that they think the stock is shit so Joe buys it. And it just comes down to the seller being a shitty person trying to make some easy gain.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something? In the day of the dinosaurs, sure the internet wasn't a thing so it was harder to be on the up and up with stocks. But technology is all around now. Please explain to this smooth brain.

Hey, apes. Just a quick note to say that the ""evidence"" presented for denouncing the collusion between MW and the Hedgies is laughable. I'm rarely a contrarian, I just want to avoid discussions becoming echo chambers.

If you ask any webdev, dealing with Time/Timezones online is extremely tricky despite being a trivial subject. 

If you ask any journo worth their salt, with these type of breaking news, they'll have articles pre-written for the most plausible scenarios (e.g., 1 for each possible winner of Game 7 of the MLB World Series), and they'll adjust minor details like the exact numbers right before posting.

Like I *know* these fuckers can be and probably have been paid off (as suggested by their often unilateral coverage), but I need to remind myself to put biases aside and consider things as clearly as possible. Particularly, if my ability to make tendies and evaluate greed vs. fear objectively depends on the unbiasedness of such consideration.

That being said‚Äîremember there's no **WE**‚Äî Ima make these MFs bleed some cash tomorrow.
