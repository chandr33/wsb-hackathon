Are you planning to go on a war with them? Will you look for more short HF positions and repeat the GME thing? How does this end?
What are the possible scenarios - are we talking about new, nationwide laws and regulations in US?

I am genuinely curious, as I live in Europe (Poland) and the GME thing is pretty exotic to me. I guess that when the time comes, this whole situation will most likely have some impact on other markets as well.
