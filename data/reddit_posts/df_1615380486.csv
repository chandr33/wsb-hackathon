Early this morning there was a bright light and I awoke to the swelling of a heavenly chorus. My eyes opened and focused on the grinning, drooling, creature before me. ""Two eighty-three,"" he said, shaking me fully awake. ""Time to go!""

I ran to the window, like a child hearing Santa's sleigh bells. There, in the glistening snow, sat a cartoon rocket ship, filled with my brothers and sisters.

""C'mon,"" he said, nudging me to the door. ""We've got a LOT of stops to make!""

""But..but what about the cat?"" I was worried about my scrawny friend, who had shown up suddenly right after the new year.

""Oh! He's not a cat. Didn't you hear him say that?""

My seatbelts snapped shut and the thrust of this luxurious rocket was barely perceptible. A glass of cool champagne was pressed into my hand. ""Where are we going?"" I inquired of the server.

""Beyond the stars,"" came the soft voice. ""Beyond the stars!""",Please Feed The Cat...,1.0,1615381309,aDustyMonk
