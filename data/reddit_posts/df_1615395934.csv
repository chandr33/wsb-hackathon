EPS 0.05 in Q4 of 2020. That was when currencies were roughly half the price that it is now. LET THAT SINK IN.

It is going to get uplisted soon either to NYSE or NASDAQ in the coming weeks/months. Once that happens, it will be exposed to the masses.

Short volume at 50% because HF don't know anything about defi and want finance to be centralized. Potential for short squeeze as it is in the beginning of bull cycle for defi. Watch this stonk kill it this year.🚀🚀🚀 for HIVE.

Note: it is very volatile so if you have weak paper hands, don't get into this.
