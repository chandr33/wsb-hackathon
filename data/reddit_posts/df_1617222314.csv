8,mhf0di,"I wanted to spitball a little theory on the future of electric cars. This may be totally wrong, I am by no means good at any of this, and this is my first time ever sharing anything that remotely resembles DD.

I think its time we acknowledge that unless battery tech makes some Star Trek level leap forward, it looks increasingly less viable that we'll be able to produce enough batteries to meet the demand of electric cars and every other battery powered device of the future. 

Lithium is by far a very abundant elements. Estimates are there are between [30-95 million](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/09/15/how-long-will-the-lithium-supply-last/) tons available in the earths crust. The Gov's data sheet covers [lithium consumption up to 2019](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf), though its not the only source of concern. 

Its truly not the most environmentally friendly option. As it stands now [lithium battery recycling](https://www.wired.com/story/the-race-to-crack-battery-recycling-before-its-too-late/) is still commercially viable, and the recouped materials don't even include any of the lithium. They recycling process alone is a fossil fuel powered smelter that cooks off all unwanted materials, including plastic, which we all know is fun to burn in a bon-fire but shitty for the world and our health. 

Looking towards other viable tech options, hydrogen reactor tech seems the most viable pivot. Not only is it relatively simple to convert a battery car to hydrogen reactor, data centers already utilize this technology as cheaper, greener and efficient backup generators favoring them over diesel. 

Hydrogen fuel is harvested from water, then converted back to water as the only exhaust when converted to electricity. 

Though there are many hydrogen fuel cell/reactor companies out there the following are the cornerstone of my long-gamble. 

HYSR (Sunhydrogen inc) is looking to make hydrogen collection as efficient and cheap as possible. At literally 13 cents a share right now this is the most speculative part of my gamble, but if their Gen 2 refinery pans out they have the potential to become a main player on the level of BP if this technology becomes cornerstone to our energy needs. 

PLUG (Plug Power inc) is leader in hydrogen fuel cell tech which is the main reason for throwing money at them. Secondary, they're one of few companies looking forward to the inevitable need to convert existing battery cars into hydrogen reactor cars. 

im still researching other companies, but again there are so many and good DD is hard to come by, harder to do on your own. 

That being said, you shouldn't trust me, im not a financial advisor. I'm simply shitting in the wind to see if anyone else has caught a whiff of what I feel is on the horizon.",Impending scaling issue with powered electric cars,1.0,1617222686,Wesinator2000

17,mhf3m6,"Hey folks, don’t get me wrong Im no financial advisor, Im just your everyday retard, but I think I’ve found something worth your time here. So lets talk about Xebec Absorption Inc.

XBC is a Canadian renewable energy company with a focus in end to end systems for gas purification, and the production of renewable hydrogen and natural gas. So right off the bat, the good news is this is a hot sector and while I think this is a good short term play this sector will definitely be more relevant a few years down the line. Heres a Forbes article about the importance of renewable hydrogen in the future:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/12/14/green-hydrogen-the-fuel-of-the-future-set-for-50-fold-expansion/?sh=30a6092c6df3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/12/14/green-hydrogen-the-fuel-of-the-future-set-for-50-fold-expansion/?sh=30a6092c6df3)

Now, thats great and all but you’re probably looking at the chart thinking “Wow this guy is a fucking sped bag holder”. Im not, I only recently entered my position at 100x$4.10 per share, so Im already up. But Im not here to brag or fuck your wife, so heres why I think this has the potential to show some good gains within a couple months.

**Technicals**

Today volume picked up from around 450,000 at midday to 830,000 in about 2 hours, and the price went up. To me this indicates most of the volume today was shares being bought, as right when the volume started picking up we saw a reversal in the daily trend.

On the one month chart XBC.TO has an RSI of 28, for those of you who are retarded and don’t know what that means: anything under an RSI of 30 means it is oversold. However, the weekly RSI is at 53 which is neutral. But theres something else to consider, and thats that we are in one of the largest bull markets ever. When you’re in a bull market, you treat the RSI a little differently and values under 50 are considered oversold, and values over 80 are considered overbought. As I said earlier, XBC is extremely oversold for the month, but this week it has been recovering to neutral. Whats important is a significant spike from oversold to neutral RSI in about a week, which is a bullish indicator.

**But why was it oversold?**

To be completely honest with you, XBC fucked up their Q4 2020 earnings and it dipped over 50% from its ATH of $11.55. Heres an article going a bit more in depth about what happened:

[www.fool.ca/2021/03/15/this-growth-stock-crashed-50-time-to-buy](http://www.fool.ca/2021/03/15/this-growth-stock-crashed-50-time-to-buy)

As Im sure you filthy gamblers know, small cap stocks like XBC react very strongly to news. Bad Q4 earnings isn’t all that happened though, as some retail investor retard like us filed a class action once XBC dropped 50% (which isn’t necessarily a new occurrence, but news of the lawsuit dropped the price even more). Rumour has it that this “investor” had a grand total of $2000 invested in the stock. Thats less than what his wife’s boyfriend gives her monthly for shoe shopping. What Im saying is, the plaintiff is a fucking cuck, and his wife will pity fuck him as he cries over realizing his losses while XBC jumps back to $7.

Its important to understand, XBC like many other low cap growth stocks had a fantastic run in 2020 ($2.50-$11.55). Once news of the bad Q4 happened, it naturally dipped but I believe this triggered a large sell off as people were scared to lose their unrealized gains, which is why we see it at todays price of $4.30 and the monthly RSI supports this theory. I truly believe this dip is far too dramatic and XBC is destined to rebound soon.

**Is that all retard?**

No. Here are some more minor points for XBC to gain fairly soon:

* Over the past few days the CEO and CFO (Kurt Sorschak and Stéphane Archambault) purchased around 20,000 and 10,000 shares respectively, so management is clearly anticipating a turnaround. But its not just him, William Beckett and Guy Saint-Jacques, both on the board of directors have also increased their positions. Heres a source on insider buying and XBC:

[https://www.canadianinsider.com/company?ticker=XBC](https://www.canadianinsider.com/company?ticker=XBC)

* The company has over 150m in cash and cash equivalents
* Plans on future acquisitions
* Upcoming potential hydrogen contract wins

**TL;DR**

Stonk go up soon. Stonk also good long term. Insiders go brr. Sorry you cant read retard.

Hi all, I think lots of people already know about $MVIS.

Today at 3:00 pm one of the news came out

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

Summary : Microsoft wins US army contract for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years.

**You might be asking, Hey idiot that's Microsoft contract, not MVIS?**

Microsoft has launched Hololens 1 in 2016 and Hololens 2 in 2019 May. Many of us did not see the product in real life because the technology inside cost a lot, and Hololens 2 is being sold above $3000 for commercial business.

apparently, If you teardown Hololens2, you will see very critical module that enables AR headset made by MVIS.

Reddit doesn't allow to post youtube link, search, ""hololens 2 teardown""

If you watch, you will see MVIS modules in the Hololens2. YES if Microsoft is going to make an AR headset to US army, they have to use MVIS module in it. This significantly improves future cashflow for the company, especially we all know growth stocks are having trouble of generating revenue until the company ripens. I am sure MVIS will not go bankrupt by now.

**How can you be sure Microsoft will use MVIS's module in the AR headset?**

This is basically can be analyzed by looking at MVIS's technology. Does the company have enough intellectual properties that no other companies can be followed?

From MVIS homepage, you will se their technology foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fyvjxqjfgfq61.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f1acb833c2686be966ca04a4382ffb46bb90e52

MVIS Technology

MVIS has been found in 1993 and has been developing all intellectual property that no other followers can catch up easily. This will enforce MVIS's business and further, it would be possible to make profit from licensing their intellectual property in the future.

Summary: If Microsoft Hololens 2 does not use MVIS's technology, that would be a scam AR headset.

**Stock price has been pumped by 50% today and hit $18.55, is it still a buy?**

**YES and YES.** Recently, the stock price has been pushed down, we all know it was because of the fear of 10-yr bond yield has been increased sharply, which increases the discount level of growing tech stocks which do not generate much cash flow.

However, for MVIS, it stepped one more stop up to the MOON. Now the risk of getting bankruptcy, creating revenue bas been significantly decreased. Remember once you have a contract with US army and a company like Microsoft, your company's portfolio starts to shine and it will extend its business exponentially.

Further, Keep in mind that MVIS is also targeting automobile market where they need Lidar sensor.I understand you like stocks like apple, tesla, oh **GME, AMC, BB,** but MVIS is also a strong bull stock if you look far enough.

I think today's news is just the beginning, with all of you degenerates, I will see you guys on the MOON.

TL;DR

I LIKE THE STOCK MVIS GME AMC BB MOON.

I heard that their “EPS” was going to be amazing so I thru a little cash at it and their expected was supposed to be $0.23 though their actual turned out to be $26.06. That’s a huge f’n gain I thought to myself hell yeah going to be able to buy a bushel of bananas. But nope so instead I took the few extra bucks and bought the dip this afternoon. Im just wondering how these companies with great news or good numbers always seem to be pushed down.",Why do fundamentals not matter anymore,1.0,1617224541,knuckledragger59

Recently investment fund Archegos caused $30 billion dollars in market selling as a result of failed overleveraged (LOL) margin calls, with many positions being leveraged 8:1 and some as bad as 20:1! As a result, over the recent week we saw share price in ViacomCBS ($VIAC) &amp; Discovery ($DISCA) fall as far as 50% 👀  Whenever a security takes a plunge like this, especially since its caused by a forced sellers rather than a technical or corporate change, they return! This is basically a half off sale on two very very large and successful media corps. Viacom owns BET, Paramount, CBS, CBS Streaming, CBS News &amp; CBS Sports, Discovery is discovery channel. 

As you can see, we are pushing the very bottom of a 1D/1Y regression channel, looking for BIG  this week or next on both securities. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!",DISCA A EASY SWING TRADE,1.0,1617224982,False-Income-9371

They have innovated in the sector since IPO, but the only thing holding them back was their balance sheet. They had one of the worst PE ratios, as well as not being profitable, and many other financial shortcomings. On Monday after hours, they reported 2020 full year results, and it was incredible. 1,908% revenue increase year over year ($230 mill), EPS of .53 basic, .45 diluted, compared to .01 loss per share in 2019, $119 million in net earnings compared to a $1 million loss in 2019. Here's a [Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html) on the full results. I don't see much holding this stock back from reentering it's IPO of around $60, it popped up 27% today, $33.96 as of writing. I'm not going to do a full DD, but hopefully this brought some apes attention to this stock, sorry for not talking about it a few days ago when it was cheaper.
