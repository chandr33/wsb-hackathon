14,lxwltn,"So I noticed there are like 8 million more losers here since I last checked and a lot of you idiots are in the daily thread whining that you got locked out of your account because you got flagged for PDT and now you can't trade. I'm gonna give a quick refresher on how to not do that...

Option 1: Don't be poor, ask your wife's boyfriend for $25k so you can trade like a big boy. If you're too intimidated to do that there's a second option.

Option 2: Turn your long option plays into a vertical spread and just close it the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say tomorrow you want to gamble on $SPY. You think that bond yields aren't real and the SP500 should go up 50% year over year with no corrections. Well $SPY is currently trading at $376, so you buy a $376 call.

Now 3 hours later, $SPY has rallied to $380 But you're a poor smoothbrain ape with only like $300 and a Wendy's Coupon in your life savings. *You can't close the trade because of PDT, so you're stuck holding onto it until tomorrow.* *^(Oh no my gains will evaporate by the time I can take my profits.)*

**No you aren't you autistic fuck.**

You can just convert your long call position into a vertical spread. You don't need to give more handjobs behind Wendy's to deposit more money either. You can sell the call one strike above yours ($377) as long as your selling a call with the expiration same date. Your brokerage will automatically use the $376 call as collateral and you can make the trade without any available purchasing power. The $376 call will always be worth more than the $377 call, and any time the price of the option goes down, you make money on the short $377 call and essentially remove 99.9% of the risk of losing money. This locks in your profit from the trade without closing out the position, avoiding a PDT trigger.

Now you wait until the next trading day and just close out the entire position at once (buy a $377 call and sell a $376 call). This works for puts too. Just don't buy actual stock like a boomer.

So I had some debit spreads that robinhood Locked me in through out the 70% moon and didnt let me sell. Today I get an email telling me of the risk that my short leg might get exercised.

If I’m understanding correctly this means that dividend hunters will be exercising options so they can get hundreds of shares at the option price aka a massive whale can get millions of shares at strike $25 so he can collect the special dividend on it. 

I sold my debits for a massive loss (compared to unrealized cuz robinhood didn’t let me sell on the way up) and I just bought shares. I would’ve bought calls but I literally just realized this and it’s AH.

If I’m thinking correctly then every ITM call option sold will be exercised by boomers who want the special dividend. 

Just a theory. I’m retarded and I’ve lost all my money twice over the last two years; this my third time and I’m down 25% already in two weeks. Take ur own risks with ur own trades.

34,lxwpk9,"I’m a huge bull. I’ve been optimistic about the market since the crash. I bought the dip faithfully every single crash from March through the horrors of June, through the shit month that Sep was, until today.    


***
My entire perspective shifted today.    

***

# Why you might ask?

***

The whole bullish philosophy was built on the fact that the Fed printed and was willing to print indefinitely. 


This works, until they reduce their printing capabilities. 


***

In the past week or so, we’ve seen bond yields spike. Bond yields move inversely to bond prices, so this is equivalent to saying bond prices tanked. 


They tanked because investors have begun to worry about inflation and the tightened monetary policy that could come with that. Why the hell would you hold bonds if inflation basically saps away any profit you might make? You’re better off going into inflation protected assets. So investors sold off. 


***

When the Fed increases rates, they target something called the Federal Funds rate. I won’t get into the specifics since everyone here is smooth brained, but basically this rate affects all other rates including the 10-yr rate and your smooth brained momma’s 30-yr fixed rate that she bought our house with. 


The Fed hasn’t touched rates, yet the 10-yr has essentially exploded because of the bond markets sell off. It’s gone up .5% in two months. 


This is very bad because
***
1) higher yields make the stock market less attractive and 
2) higher yields absolutely fuck high growth tech stocks. 
***
Tech companies thrive off cheap lending and robust stimulus, so any increase in rates tremendously slows growth. 


[Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00760.x) have a paper that measures the effects of federal reserve interest rate changes on stock market prices. The effects are magnified for tech stocks. There are many papers examining this relationship that you can look up if you’re interested. 

***
# So what happened today?

***
JPOW spoke and to be honest, I was shocked. He mentioned that the Fed would let inflation run hot in the short term (meaning yields will remain high in the short term) and while he kept repeating that the Fed has a long road ahead, he didn’t commit or mention any sort of policy tools to keep yields low (he might at the next FOMC meeting, but I highly doubt it unless the market implodes further). This is shocking because I was entirely sure the money printer would print and yields would be forced low across the entire yield curve. 


I strongly believe this is because the Fed is willing to deflate the entire stock market in order to prevent the bubble from inflating anymore. I also believe that the Fed thinks that they can accomplish this while pushing the economy to better employment and reasonably low inflation.

***


I think retail will continue to get fucked while yields increase. I don’t think the Fed will institute Yield Curve Controls (YCC) to keep the 10-yr low. I think it’s too experimental and the economy is doing too good to justify using that tool. I think the Fed believes herd immunity will be achieved soon and that implementing such drastic policy right now will contribute massively to inflation in the short term. In other words, they won’t do it. 


Yields will continue to creep up and may level off. Tech will deflate as money exits and goes toward reopening stocks. I believe in tech, but I think the valuations we were seeing a few weeks ago would only be justified if the economy was open AND roaring WITH stimulus coming in. 

***

My plays are going to be all reopening plays. I won’t touch tech unless yields drop precipitously or if the Fed announces they’ll force the 10-yr down. In my opinion, it’s not worth playing musical chairs any longer as there are fewer and fewer seats left. 

***
TLDR: Yields will continue to increase. Tech will get fucked. Boomer stocks will do okay. Reopening stocks will do well.",DD: Tech Bubble could be starting to Deflate,0.87,1614895525,oompaloompa224
