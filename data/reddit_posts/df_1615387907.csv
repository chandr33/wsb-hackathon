Fellow apes, this is very simple but first let me say sorry for the picture with portuguese words but I assume most of you can read any language anyway. Well the picture above, not only points to the moon, but also shows - via google trends - that ""trendwise"" GME &amp; Gamestop are at the same level as they were back in 2020. This pictures the reason behind the blackout that is going on around the media: it can be very very dangerous (read interesting for us) if this thing gets the smallest bit of media focus because it will just fuel the biggest rocket launch in the whole security history.

Already with dispensaries in New York, Illinois, Mass, Connecticut, and Illinois, Curaleaf is poised to grow significantly in the state of New Jersey. And as many of you potheads know, New Jersey just legalized recreational marijuana, which may lead Pennsylvania, New York, and Connecticut to legalized recreational in the next few years. 

Furthermore, Curaleaf just yesterday announced they are acquiring EMMAC, a European cannabis company, setting the table for global expansion. At the time of this posting, Curaleaf is trading at under $16 a share, less than both Aphria and Tilray. Plus Curaleaf already has a presence in the US market.

The catch with Curaleaf is it’s not on Robinhood at all. I have no idea why you can’t find Curaleaf on the Robinhood app (besides Robinhood being a garbage app). I use fidelity and have been in on Curaleaf since October 2020.

**TL;DR Grocery is exploding and UNFI is riding the wave as earnings annihilated shorts and reaffirmed an incredible 2021 guidance** 

Last week I posted the pre-earnings UNFI [dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwyjf4/the_preearnings_play_unfi_to_the_moon_dd_and/).). Today we know I was right. The earnings were insane, crushed all estimates, and at time of writing the stock sits up \[13%\]. To those apes that still haven’t heard of UNFI, go to your fridge and open the door. Yeah that’s right, everything in there has been supplied by UNFI. They are the largest grocery supplier in the US that got into a tiff with Goldman Sachs who’s been [shitting](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Goldman+Sachs+Assumes+United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29%2C+Downgrades+to+Sell/14756432.html) on them since 2018 and they [sued](https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/unfi-sues-goldman-sachs-over-supervalu-deal) in 2019. You can read more about that bullshit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig4v4/omg_goldman_sachs_lowers_rating_of_a_stock_that/). Basically if you have a fridge, and that fridge has food, then UNFI has your money. 

**Q2 Earnings Highlights**

Let's go over the insane earnings they just reported:

1. **Adjusted EPS of $1.25, a 400% increase**

2. **Adjusted EBITDA** of $206 million, a 57.3% increase

3. **Net income** of $59 million, an increase of $90 million

4. **Net sales** increased 7.1% to $6.89 billion

5. **Net Debt of 2.49 billion,** a decrease of $242 million driven by $265 million in cash provided by operations

6. Bringing **BC** services into their services portfolio!

[Q2 highlights](https://preview.redd.it/kgq1orius7m61.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4303571ee66e6fabc098b20ed227794f63fbe0cf)

Earnings details in 8K filing [here](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001020859/2cabd6ad-aebf-4220-81fa-4e7474fcd464.pdf). 

**So what happens next? Grocery is sexy (**🍆and🍑**), because Amazon said so**

Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. 

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are already in development. “Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

“H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”

Based on the latest 10-K, UNFI has been the distributor to Whole Foods for more than twenty years. Under the terms of their agreement with Whole Foods, they are the primary distributor in all its regions in the United States. Whole Foods is also the only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020.

**Deep Fucking Value Comparison with Other Food Distribution Stocks**   

*Processing img mgn0egjis7m61...*

I was going to highlight green the cell for each stock that hit the best metric for each category, but they all went to UNFI – oh well. The entire business is basically selling for what’s on the balance sheet despite growing revenues and earnings. If that’s not deep fucking value, I don’t know what is. If UNFI joined its peers at the 7B+ market cap level, that’s a $130+ stock price. UNFI used to be in the $40s in 2018 and hit an all-time-high of $80 back when its revenue was only 8B in 2015. Now revenues are 3x higher, but the stock is 3x lower, go figure. 

**Three** **Major Catalysts to Note**

Fatal blows to the shorts. Be it the announcement of:

~~·~~ **~~Amazon Deal~~** ~~– to be the exclusive supplier to all Whole Foods locations~~ Announced March 4, 2021

· **Property Sales** – their retail business (Cub Foods) or unused real estate (underutilized distribution centers) to strengthen balance sheet and pay off more debt

· **New hotshot CEO** – they confirmed that current CEO will be retiring but extended timeline for new CEO search

If you’ve gotten this far then congrats you are now a UNFI expert and know that this is a medium to long term play (1 year) with some squeeze potential given the large short %. Trading at around $30, with the massive market potential for grocery this year and the deep value compared to other food distributors, I can see UNFI hitting $80 or about 4B market cap sometime in 2021. 

**My advice? Go eat some groceries because you’re skin and bones. Also I like tendies and UNFI literally supplies them.** 🚀 🍆 🚀 🍆 🚀

Disclosure: If you hate money and hate food, then this is not the stock for you. I on the other hand am hard as a 🍆 for UNFI and have put my money in my mouth with over [500K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ham0/unfi_yolo_preearnings_update_march_9_2021_last/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in the stock.

TLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we’re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. 

Ever since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming “We like the stock!” could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However… one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or… peel out?

First we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? 

**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there’s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. 

**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. 

**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b ← with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.

**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https://www.amctheatres.com/about/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. 

**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn’t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.
Next, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. 

https://i.imgur.com/ramEhoQ.png

**Blockbuster movies lined up/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow &amp; Tom Gun: Maverick.

**The discord bot don’t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!

https://i.imgur.com/nmbRPmi.png

**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won’t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy &amp; hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he ""doesn't do salt.""

Comparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don’t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found:

**Harambe’s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME’s 12M shares with AMC’s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME’s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher “Days to Cover” than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.  What Harambe’s trying to say here is: Me like AMC. Apes stronger together. AMC to the moon.",AMC Squeeze Me Harder Daddy,1.0,1615388266,dubyawinfrey
