[When you find out Shane McMahon is one of the Founders of IDEX and is also currently sitting on the Board of Directors](https://i.redd.it/o6v5z1w2r1m61.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly ***did*** know this before buying my IDEX stock about a year ago when it was around $1, (made a nice bit of change when it jumped to $5 too) but the whole point of buying was ultimately to see where it went since old Shane has his hands in the company. It was a YOLO decision I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

But a lot of my friends are seeing the IDEX stock in the news these days and when they find out old Vincey-Boi's son was one of the founders and is still on the Board of Directors in the company, they tell me IDEX will become the next meme stonk.

# What technical indicators are saying about $UWMC

📷[**Discussion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwmctothemoon/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

What's up peeps. Spent the morning reviewing a bunch of indicators for our favorite stock. Here's what I got:

1.)

📷

2.)

📷

3.)

📷

Trend Indicators:

1 Bollinger Bands - slight upwards trend

3 Parabola (daily) - bullish signal

2 Ichimoku Cloud (daily) - strong and accurate signal for hitting resistance line (which is the green line of the ichimoku cloud), bearish signals as well with a declining base line.

2 Stochastics (daily) - slightly bearish, I believe this will change after today's rally so keeping an eye on this.

2 Stochastics (weekly) - bullish signal

MACD - inaccurate slightly bullish signal

RSI - oversold

3 TSI - oversold and bullish trend

Volatility Indicators:

3) Average True Range - huge volatility ahead

1. Bollinger Bands - increasing volume

Conclusion:

Mixed signals, but overall mostly bullish signs from recent price action. Regardless of price, every indicator is signaling an upcoming storm of volatility. Of course this is bias as I am a shareholder, but I believe there is an upcoming short term up-trend. Hopefully this is the break out we've been looking for.

\_\_\_\_\_  


I'm personally excited about UWMC. Still riding the GME and AMC rocket but this company isn't getting  opportunity to be discussed in WSB. This one should be a short to medium term hyper stock with the addition to Russell 1000 and 3000 upcoming.
