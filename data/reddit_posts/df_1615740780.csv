8,m4yuy6,"Don’t forget the end goal.

It’s great and all that some of you have taken it upon yourselves to adopt animals because it is honorable and overall a good thing, but I don’t want anybody to lose sight on endgame. But I also get that it’s the weekend and there’s not too much to do or talk about and hope these fizzle out by TONIGHT. I don’t want to be “that guy” but all the donations NOW instead of literally any other time seems kind of fishy (but not REALLY REALLY fishy). 

I’d like to add some sentiment I’ve heard from others stating that donations circulates as positive news for WSB amongst all the slanderous takes from MSM in the past month or so. Which I agree with. Hearing from the news that WSB is terrible or it’s like a “frat for straight white men” or whatever and then going onto the subreddit and seeing animal adoptions and donations to children’s hospitals would certainly make me think I’m being lied to. Being involved in this subreddit, I know that what MSM say isn’t true. It’s not a “frat for straight white men” and I know that and you know that. So it doesn’t matter what they say. I’m surprised we even still post clips of them and gather around saying “fuck you Jim cramer!” as if we all don’t know he’s a wall street shill whose pockets are lined DEEP with daddy money. As if we don’t know that CNBC streams FUD on the daily to millions of people. I am not here to convince them of anything. I am here to make some goddamn money so I can live a DECENT life. Therefore they can say whatever the hell they want and it doesn’t matter anyways. The DD stays the same, GME’s fundamentals stay the same. Ryan Cohen still exists. GME is up 400+% since February’s dip. Nothing has changed. 

I think the most positive news that will happen is when GME goes nuclear and HF’s go bankrupt. People will think “oh, those people on WSB were right. Oh wait, but CNBC told me shorts covered their positions! Oh wait, so did Forbes....and MotleyFool. So did WSJ. So did....” 

Then and ONLY then will I take my extra tendies and be honorable with them. If you’re a retard with capital to adopt animals that’s good for you but I don’t. If I did, I’d take my $200 and put it into my GME high-yield savings account. Watch it go to a million and then I’ll buy all the Nintendo switches for cancer kids and adopt a giraffe or 5 while I’m at it. But I’m not doing it now and neither should you, however that’s ultimately up to you. So go ahead and adopt 1 little measly gorilla now. I’ll adopt all the fucking gorillas in the world after this shit is over with and post it here for upvotes and karma just like you. 

I feel like this next week or two is gonna be do or die for certain HF’s and it doesn’t surprise me seeing what are practically advertisements for you to spend your money elsewhere when: 

1. Stimulus checks are dropping this week
2. March 19th rumor date
3. Many catalysts upcoming (senate hearing, possible CEO announcement, any RC + DFV tweet, earnings report, etc.) 

•IMO this is not that fishy because we’ve seen donations before, especially before and during the last run-up in January. Giving back is human in nature.  Good people doing good things is not that fishy. 

•IMO this IS fishy because of the circumstances, especially with stimulus coming out. Seems like a way to get you to spend your money somewhere else since the front page is literally an advertisement for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. 

I don’t know how to end this because I honestly didn’t know how to start it when I began taking a shit. Now I’ve been shitting for 30 minutes and haven’t even wiped my ass.

Who is Tellurian Inc?
""Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial phase will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""
Why Tellurian?
Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time.
HH - https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html
JKM - https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/lng-japan-korea-marker-platts-swap.html
Driftwood Project has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision (FID).
*** Link to Tell's latest presentation: https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation_tellurian_january-2021_final/
Current assets include:
Haynesville Gas Production Well to supply gas. 10,067 net acres and 71 producing wells.
Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana.
Driftwood plans to deliver LNG &lt; $3.50/mmBtu. ($3.50/mmBtu FOB LNG price &lt; $2.00 gas delivery + &lt; $0.75 opex + &lt; $0.75 debt service)
The value proposition to equity partners is $5 JKM to realize ROI.
All-Star Management
Tellurian has 2 of 3 pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.
Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.
Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""
Cheniere Energy (LNG) - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LNG/
LNG
Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to ""cleaner renewable"" sources from a combination of both natural gas and renewables will make up 74% of the energy landscape. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shut down during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again. Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Electricity.pdf
“Liquefied natural gas exporters
Given the unprecedented wave of LNG projects taking final investment decisions (FIDs) in 2018 and 2019, the global LNG market is expected to have surplus capacity for the next four to five years. In the second wave of LNG exports, more than 20 North American projects are competing to take FIDs, but only a few are likely to succeed. Those that can deliver LNG to Asia for no more than $7 per MMBTU have the best prospects, and those that secure privileged access to upstream gas resources can increase their projects’ cost competitiveness.”
This is the perfect example of the value in Telluriam and Driftwood Pipeline. Capitalize on being the only end-to-end exporter and ROI at $5 per MMBTU.

Potential Equity Partner Speculation
2019 - Total: $500 million in Driftwood Holdings LP. In addition, Tellurian and Total Gas &amp; Power entered into a definitive sales and purchase agreement for an additional 1.5 mtpa of LNG from Tellurian’s LNG offtake volumes from Driftwood. https://ir.tellurianinc.com/press-releases/detail/217/total-and-tellurian-finalize-driftwood-equity-investment
Speculation: India's GAIL - https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2AA2BD?utm_source=reddit.com
Speculation: Poland: PGNiG - Russia contracts expiring in 2022 and looking to import more from the US. https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-pgnig/polish-gas-firm-pgnigs-2020-lng-imports-rise-10-idUSL8N2KA5TY?utm_source=reddit.com
Speculation: India’s Adani - new partnership with Total (37% ownership) to import LNG. https://lngprime.com/asia/indias-adani-inks-lng-import-deal-with-total/11332/
Speculation: India's Petronet - They turned down MOU for an equity stake, but that doesn't mean long term spot contracts couldn't be signed.
Speculation: China - Under Biden administration, partnership with China LNG hubs on metro ports.
Price Targets
$1.50 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued between $400-$500 million / 329M shares = $1.50. 1/21/2021 - Wolfe Research - PT $5.00. 1/29/2021 - Double Moving Average Crossover (21-week 50-week) - Bullish
At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.
2021 - March/May = $4-$12 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 329M shares). February saw the peaks to $4 (as predicted) and I believe it will return to that range shortly. Institutions have been loading up. The shorts have been put on a good show with lawsuit news on earnings day, articles that focused on annual earnings vs positive Q4 performance, 10 baggers or bankruptcy fluff article in addition to one of the largest market downturns in 4 months. Q1 Earnings will be rock solid in addition to early debt repayment. https://www.otcdynamics.com/tell-tellurian-strengthens-balance-sheet-reduces-debt-by-57-million/
Big wins include an appointment of Jennifer Granholm as Energy Secretary. I believe deals are waiting until this person was appointed to demonstrate collaboration between counties and the new administration. Now each deal, company, country can have its 15 min of fame. https://www.energy.gov/articles/jennifer-m-granholm-sworn-16th-secretary-energy
2021 - June/August or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)
2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.
2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.
Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share
Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share
Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.",Tellurian LNG is an undervalued gem and a potential 20x bagger with a high short float,1.0,1615741384,Comfortable99

SPCE is currently crazy undervalued at $34.

In February they had a flight window where they had a chance to fly and the stock was Steady in the $55-60 range. This is preflight, if the flight was successful no doubt the stock would of skyrocketed to $75-100+.

They ended up calling off the flight to do additional testing on their rocket system to make sure everything was good to go. I think this was a good choice and the safest decision if they had any doubts on safety of the flight.

This and other catalysts have caused the stock to fall.

Here are some factors:

1. They were slow to announce their next flight window. (Now announced for May)
2. That accompanied by the market overall having a pullback the last few weeks. 🌈🐻
3. Chamath pulling 1/4th of his investment out for liquidity (15m shares remain &amp; he is still a chairman he has went on record stating he believes in the company recently!)

&amp;#x200B;

These factors really tanked this baby down to a low of $24 last week, back to its price in January.
It’s already rebounded back to $34!

I believe over the next two months approaching may we are going to continue to see a rebound in price on the stock back to its former resistance levels around the $50-60 range if not higher!

Stimmy checks on the way!

If the flight goes as planned, which after additional checks it should, it will be a gigantic catalyst for this stock!

Once regular flights are happening we have some HUGE named celebrities that already have pre-purchased tickets to fly with SPCE.

Names Like:

1. LEO DICAPRIO             “WOLF OF WALLSTREET”
2. JUSTIN BIEBER           “Biebs”
3. PETER THIEL               “Co-Founder Palpal, Palantir”
4. JAMES CAMERON      “JCAM”
5. RIHANNA                     “RiRi Diamond Hands” 
6. TOM HANKS                “Hanksman” 
7. Richard Branson          “Billionaire Space Dad”

Expect videos from these celebrities of space to go viral and only further drive this stock and company upward as it will TREND BIG!

They also have a Mach 3 Project for transporting things around the globe at insane speeds.

My fellow Apes, please do your own DD and see the Glory of SPCE!

71,m4z8vt,"About one year ago I decided to open a new account just for fun dedicated to active trading with $69k. Today is the one year anniversary of the said account. So I am celebrating $1.3M in gains with three cups of morning coffees instead of my usual two. I felt a lot of rules we set on ourselves limit returns we can get. The strategies I use for this account would be shitted on by investment professionals and most people lurking on value investing forums. This account was dedicated for fun trading using strategies that I don't implement on the other accounts I manage. I have been sharing my DDs here with the community.

I know you are going to ask for my positions. Even thought I am reluctant, I will comply. **Since this is an active trading account the info will be useless since I trade in and out of positions very frequently. I don't day trade either. Day traders are stupid**. Also I want to mention that for the first half of the year I did not invest in options and my leverage is always less than 120%. In retrospect that was a mistake and I could have amplified my returns several fold. I do not go long on meme stocks. Mentioning some of the positions would violate Sub rules and I will withhold those unmentionable positions. So here are the **top 5 positions** in each category:

Current % biggest losers: GME puts, RACE calls, AMCX short, two positions are unmentionable

Current $ biggest loser: AMCX short, RACE calls, three unmentionable

Current % biggest winners: XOM calls, BA calls, three unmentionable

Current $ biggest winners: top two are unmentionable, Eventbrite, Six flags, BA calls

Current biggest positions: top two are unmentionable, Disney, Eventbrite, Unmentionable","Celebrating my 1 year anniversary of my experimental active trading account. $69,000 to $1,320,000.",1.0,1615742045,_WinnerTakesAll_

77,m4z9p2,"Hate to break it to you ""APES"" but **Wall Street is neck-deep in GME**. This isn't a reason to sell, I'm long, but it's a reality check a lot of heart-wearing fools desperately need.

Here is a list of the top holders from [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/ownership). Let's dive into some of these and keep a running tally of ownership of the shares outstanding:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **RIMA MANAGEMENT:** 7.24% - This is [Senvest](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/rima-management-llc) "" Senvest Management is a hedge fund with **8 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $2,057,887,278 (Form ADV from 2020-03-30)."" note these figures were from 1Q20 and the EOY AUM was closer to $2.5B, but we don't have post-GME rally figures.
2. [**D.E. Shaw &amp; Co Lp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Shaw_%26_Co.#2007_-_Financial_crisis)**:** 4.07% - "" [D. E. Shaw &amp; Company](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/d-e-shaw-co-inc) . is a hedge fund with **39 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $82,122,009,631 (Form ADV from 2020-10-23)"" This one is a massive hedge fund with almost $100B in AUM as of October 2020.
3. [**Maverick Capital**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_Capital) 2.53%- "" Hedge fund[Maverick Capital](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/maverick-capital-ltd) is run by Lee S. Ainslie III."" this is a standard long/short equity fund with $6.25B AUM.
4. [**Scion Asset Management, LLC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry#Investment_career): 2.44% - ""[Scion Asset Management](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc) is a hedge fund with **6 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $386,906,493""
5. **Permit Capital**: 1.76% - ""[Permit Capital](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/permit-capital-llc) is a hedge fund with **6 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $506,003,844""
6. **Masters Capital Management, LLC**: 1.43% - ""[Masters Capital Management](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/masters-capital-management-llc) is a hedge fund with **5 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $509,339,924 (Form ADV from 2020-03-30)."" The most recent 13F shows around $1.7B AUM.
7. **Paradice Investment Management, LLC**: 1.27% - ""[Paradice Investment Management](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/paradice-investment-management-llc) is a hedge fund with **9 clients** and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $3,187,936,668 (Form ADV from 2020-09-28).""

&amp;#x200B;

So just in the top 20 shareholders, you can see that **20.74% of the GME shares are owned by 7 hedge funds that manage money for less than 100 clients**.

It's time to stop being so delusional. If this is your way of ""sticking it to the hedgies"" or ""getting revenge for 2008"", then you're in the wrong place because, as you can see hedge funds are big players in GME. Additionally, you have to ask yourself if all of this bullshit about ""manipulation"" and ""ladder attacks"" is real when you have fucking D.E. Shaw as a major long, which is easily one of the most elite and prestigious hedge funds on the Street. Do you think they would stand for that? Sure, the Robinhood ordeal was bullshit that drove the stock down, but some of these other conspiracy theories are nuts and fail to recognize the major hedge fund presence in the name.",'Hedgies' Own 20% Of $GME Shares.

95,m4ze0g,"Many new GME buyers, maybe those that FOMO, think this trip to the moon, is like a sprint. 
Buying and then expect GME to moon within days (if not hours), is not realistic.

We can see from the last few trading days, is that the price goes up slowly, but surely. Because HFs can kick the can of covering their shorts later, it means the squeeze isn't likely to happen when we expect it (because HFs has spies and can read everything here to mostly counter it). So unless somehow HFs are caught offguard, this trip to the moon, is more like a marathon. A journey of endurance, of apes versus HFs. Along this journey, HFs will use and have used all kinds of dirty tricks to get us to give up (and sell), and all us fellow apes have to do is to endure (HODL) and keep putting one foot infront of another (buying more shares of GME with what can be afforded).

TLDR: HODL and Buy when you can afford to add pressure!
