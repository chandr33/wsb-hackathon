5,lwxmpe,"This is my first time talking stocks in here;  I am by no means a financial advisor because my mouth is too full of crayons to talk in a way that people can understand me.  This is not financial advise at all.

$SNDL is gearing up for a round 2 and here is why I believe that is the case:

**EPS**

$SNDL is a pretty strong performing company;  Quarter over Quarter they have seen rise in EPS.  I expect this next quarter report (coming 3/17/2021) to be no surprise that they had a good quarter; even considering the recent investment into Indiva (producer of edibles). [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-and-indiva-announce-22-million-strategic-investment-301228664.html)

**Trading Sideways**

SNDL has been trading sideways since 2/19/2021.  It has stabilized at 1.40 a share; so the current price (today, in my eyes) is still a good deal and it is poised for movement any day.

**Options Activity**

Looking up Options expiring 3/19/2021 we can see that Open Call Interest at or above $1.5 strike totals 196.1k with a whopping 44.5k of those at a $4 Strike vs the Open Put Interest and or below $1.5 Strike is 61k.  This is close to 3x Open Calls v Puts as of today's trade price of $1.36 (at the time of writing this line).  This is very Bullish for a 3/19/2021 rise in stock price which associates with the release of quarter performance above.

**EDIT: Volume Activity**

At the end of 2/23, 2/24, and 3/1 someone has been scooping up HUGE volume at this price point.  Most likely a large firm looking to capitalize on the future price change. Since the price is going down most of today I expect another big volume spike close to closing bell today which will further solidify my views that Round 2 is coming.

**Weed is good**

It is..  and if I am totally wrong you will still own a portion of a very great company that will be a strong long position.

**My plan**
I own about 350 shares of underlaying and a few call options between 1.5 and 3 strike for 3/19 and 3/26 expiration..  The shares are at a discount to a very likely $1.5 rebound.   if you favor shares over options I would say HIGHLY LIKELY to gain at least $0.20 or more per share in the short term.

My first ever DD so please be kind.  I am welcome if other monkey's want to check into my claims.

Again; I eat crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; this is not investment advice, do your own DD and make your own decisions.",Why $SNDL Round 2 is imminent,0.7,1614788184,PsyNami

33,lwxqfb,"Okay listen up you fucking apes. Put down the crayons and stop thinking about your wife‚Äôs boyfriend pounding her from both ends. First I have to say that I have no idea what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about and this is NOT A P&amp;amp;D (kinda sus to even say that but fuck it). I‚Äôm actually just expressing my opinions on American Airlines.

Alright let me get into the shit.

*pops addy

I took a Buisness class in college. It was economics and I got a C+ on the final so I‚Äôm pretty schooled when it comes to this shit. This is the thing, the airline industry is an oligopoly. I think. I‚Äôm pretty sure. Basically that means these airline companies are fucking monsters and even when they‚Äôre down bad, they don‚Äôt go out of Buisness most of the time. Now AAL has over a 60% call percentage which doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with what I‚Äôm saying but whatever.

Point is AAL moved in a patter since it‚Äôs IPO where it rose to around $50 and back down but it keeps doing this‚ÄîI call it the Harry Potter because it looks like his scar when you draw it a little. 

Anyways, before AAL has a chance to go back up to hit that $50 burger, Covid came and fucked the world in its wide asshole and everything took a fall. Now it‚Äôs making a climb and I don‚Äôt see how, in the near to distant future, AAL doesn‚Äôt climb back to around $50. Especially when covid restrictions are cut back around the world and the vaccine rolls out I can‚Äôt see how everyone who‚Äôs been locked up for a year doesn‚Äôt buy the first flight to Boca Raton to visit Gam Gam.

This is all assumptions that I‚Äôm making and the due diligence I did is more introspection done through the smoking of various drugs and chemicals. My brain is fried that‚Äôs a fact, but I just don‚Äôt see how AAL can be at 22 and not be a good buy. I got in at 11 so I‚Äôm chilling but can someone please put me in my place and tell me I‚Äôm a fucking ape. If this shit is the chosen one and I‚Äôm sure it is it‚Äôs gonna Harry Potter back up to 55 for sure sometime in the future so I don‚Äôt see how I can lose.

Disclosure: I am not a stock advisor (that much is obvious) also I eat crayons and try my grandpas pocket pussy every once in a while. It‚Äôs quite enjoyable.

SEC don‚Äôt come after me when AAL hits $55.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm on a diet of crayons and aderall right now but I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôm autistic as shit.

41,lwxrj8," Rocket Companies shares rose as much as 75% on Tuesday as the mortgage originator became the latest heavily-shorted stock to squeeze short-sellers.

 Trading in Rocket (ticker: RKT) stock was halted three times for volatility on Tuesday. Shares closed at $41.60 for a gain of 71.2%. The company is one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, with 39.7% of float shorted. 

 ‚ÄúRocket Mortgage-why was 38% of this company sold short?‚Äù tweeted Jim Cramer of CNBC‚Äôs Mad Money shortly after 2 p.m. on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really solid company, may not¬† be your fave if rates soar, but it is so well run!‚Äù

88,lwxx88,"This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other ~~new investors~~ retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me.

**This is not investment advice**, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a ""day trade"". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.

Pattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who ""day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period"", and a day trade is classified as ""the opening and closing of securities on the same day"". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.

For example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:

- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.

when read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.

I'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.

I have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.

Last thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.

As for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice).
