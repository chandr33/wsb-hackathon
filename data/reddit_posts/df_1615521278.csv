7,m392z1,"With the big equity and cash investment from constellation brands (one of the largest beverage manufacturers)...and a number of ex-Constellation brand members on the leadership team, it seems like they have a really unique opportunity to take over the cannabis beverage industry, which would be huge for non-smokers. They recently released [Quatreau](https://www.directcbdonline.com/brand/quatreau/) in the US, which is sparked seltzer...so clearly they have a good grasp on US consumer trends and strong logistic capabilities due to Constellation. Note, the drink is only CBD, which is legal...but they could easily add THC.

Additionally, they have a complex pending merger happening with Acreage, which is a very strong Cannabis based holding company in the US. They own 70% and when marijuana gets federal legalization, they can purchase the remaining 30%. The company is almost profitable (which is impressive for a US cannabis company) and has a number of product lines: vapes, dispensaries, bud etc... they are focused on building out in states that have high usage and are legal. They also have a really impressive board/executive team with ex-politicians, executives etc...https://investors.acreageholdings.com/governance/leadership-team/default.aspx. So essentially, when marijuana becomes legal, Canopy has a guaranteed contract to own this company and it would essentially become Canopy‚Äôs US arm. Will note, they also helped them roll out the Quatreau drink.

I was rattled. I called my broker to complain. It‚Äôs a large reputable bank. They said that .15 was the highest bid. I insisted that they email me every bid to the millisecond around the time of my trade. The guy said no problem I can email you it. Then he put me on hold. Came back 20 min later and said he did more digging and spoke to 6 different staff. The first 5 all said .15 was the best bid available but somehow the 6th staff member found that there were bids above .4 at the time of my trade. So they instantly adjusted my account.

 Of course, this isn‚Äôt financial advice and the only things I know about technical analysis are from internet research and trend observation the past couple years, but I‚Äôm interested in getting some input from anyone that wants to discuss something other than GME. I‚Äôm still hodling GME and truly do not want anyone to sell for any reason until the tendies come in a big way, but this is not GME related. I‚Äôm also a bit newer to Reddit so I have screenshots at the ready but haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to include them yet...

I‚Äôm long on $HASI (they invest in sustainable infrastructure like renewable energy) and have been watching MACD, 20/50/200 day EMA, OBV daily for large order moves and monthly for trend deviation, and RSI usually at a 3 month interval. HASI has been in a short term down trend by all indicators but the 200 day EMA has still be trending up long term, and I think all signals just reversed today pointing to another climb. 

From OBV at close/AH, Theres significant positive volume which seems to be bullish for the days to follow. 

Looking at a 1-3 month view, Price also closed today above both the 20 and 50 day EMA (20 day is just below 50 day still but slopes are turning), and above $60, which has acted as a support/resistance level. MACD lines also turned today, turning histogram green for the first time since 1/14. On top of that, RSI just crossed over 50 again for the first tome in over a month looking at 1 and 3 month charts, not quite as sharply as I would like, but seems to have more than just grazed the line. 

More on a macro scale, the OBV over the course of the downtrend hasn‚Äôt been as significant as the price movement or previous upward OBV, and the price stayed above the 200 day EMA so far, which makes me think it‚Äôs about to start heading up again. 

The next major resistance level seems to be $70, which is where the price sat for a few days before retreating to as low of a close as 51.26 earlier this week. My thought/hope is the short term down trend just for reversed and the price will March through $70. 

If anyone read through to this far, I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback if I‚Äôm just delusional and reading this all wrong or onto something here. My background is in engineering, not any kind of trading or financial analytics, so this could easily all be wrong but I love constructive criticism.

Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome. 

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.** 

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too). 

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on. 

**Act 2: A New Breed** 

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom. 

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until recently. 

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care. 

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock. 

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&amp;o=&amp;pl=&amp;ph=&amp;ll=&amp;lh=&amp;fd=730&amp;fdr=&amp;td=0&amp;tdr=&amp;fdlyl=&amp;fdlyh=&amp;daysago=&amp;xp=1&amp;vl=25&amp;vh=&amp;ocl=&amp;och=&amp;sic1=-1&amp;sicl=100&amp;sich=9999&amp;grp=0&amp;nfl=&amp;nfh=&amp;nil=&amp;nih=&amp;nol=&amp;noh=&amp;v2l=&amp;v2h=&amp;oc2l=&amp;oc2h=&amp;sortcol=0&amp;cnt=100&amp;page=1), or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%. 
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019. 
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B. 
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million. 
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020. 

Ratios: 

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019. 
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019. 
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all. 

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements** 

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green: 

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html). 
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say. 
* Companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&amp;T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO. 
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far. 
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp. 
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.** 

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions. 

Anyhoo: 

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory. 
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty. 
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads. 

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang. 

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:  I planned to post this before LUMN ran 15% in a week. I still think  there is upside! This is not a YOLO on FD's stock! Leap calls are the  move here folks.**

Ok what's up you fucks? It's [u/afitdinosaur](https://www.reddit.com/u/afitdinosaur/) coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that [r/gangbang](https://www.reddit.com/r/gangbang/) tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/)  DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still  think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted  that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the  pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables  are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a  tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking  welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm)  filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be  referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie  The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads  approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that  the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp),  which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride  the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No  he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused  about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and  complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch  the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get  your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here  lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN  is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know  that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom  industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has  got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So,  much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was  rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not  replace them faster than they died.

Until recently.

LUMN  has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution  company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids  love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI  driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration  systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

Recently,  they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch  that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8%  the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post  this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by  PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now  trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you  degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&amp;o=&amp;pl=&amp;ph=&amp;ll=&amp;lh=&amp;fd=730&amp;fdr=&amp;td=0&amp;tdr=&amp;fdlyl=&amp;fdlyh=&amp;daysago=&amp;xp=1&amp;vl=25&amp;vh=&amp;ocl=&amp;och=&amp;sic1=-1&amp;sicl=100&amp;sich=9999&amp;grp=0&amp;nfl=&amp;nfh=&amp;nil=&amp;nih=&amp;nol=&amp;noh=&amp;v2l=&amp;v2h=&amp;oc2l=&amp;oc2h=&amp;sortcol=0&amp;cnt=100&amp;page=1), or something.

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN  recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking  obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving.  Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

Don't  understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this:  LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the  5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B  market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price  to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is  better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the  financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN  owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000  miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest  fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies  like AT&amp;T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to  expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next  bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential  buyout by AT&amp;T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still,  with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280)  on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know  what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money  will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise  throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot  of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have  made so far.
* LUMN  is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot  of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as  previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to  Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in  the LUMN camp.
* There's  a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I  think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is  leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty  much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.**  Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap,  folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking  printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call  spreads. Set and fucking forget.

99,m39ps3,"I keep seeing on this sub people posting ""not financial advice"". I don't like seeing so many apes go without financial advice so I decided to step up and help you guys out. Here's some financial advice from me:

Step 1: HODL!

Step 2: Okay once you've done that, you'll need to know when it is acceptable to stop hodling. Many people on here say around $500k per share. But to be completely honest with you, $500k is not realistic. Something more realistic would be just over $4.20 million per share. This is because there are about 9.5 million members in this subreddit. According to source 1 (which you can find down below), each member on average owns 6.9 shares of GME. Once the hedge funds accept defeat in this peculiar form of capitalist warfare, we will own approximately 49% of GME (also mentioned in source 1). Now we have to do some math, but I'll keep it simple for you apes: (9.5 million redditors) x (6.9 shares of GME) x (0.49 coefficient of ownership) x ( 0.1308 Ape's constant from the formula sheet) = $4.20 million per share.

Step 3: So now that we know what price GME will reach, we need to figure out when it will reach that price target. Personally I think this will happen on April 1st of 2021. Cuz you know why tf not?

Step 4: Once the gamma squeeze has done its squeezing and the short squeeze has done its shorting, we need to all cash out at $4.20 million per share. Now this is where things get tricky. Once we all start selling our shares, the price is going to decrease. So here's what we gotta do. When the price of GME is exactly at $4.20 million per share (and I mean EXACTLY), we each need to set limit sells to sell when GME hits $4,200,000.01 and then set limit buys to buy when GME hits $4,199,999.99. What's going to happen is when someone sells a single share, the price is going to go below $4,199,999.99. Or when someone buys a single share, the price is going to go above $420,000,000.01. Once a fluctuation of a single cent occurs, our accounts are going to absolutely fucking berserk bouncing back and forth between limit buys and limit sells. We'll break the stock market and the websites we're using.

Step 5: Once the stock market is broken, shit is going to get weird. Our brokerage accounts are all going to be messed up and all the companies we have brokerage accounts with are going to be in shambles. Now's our chance to pull a Karen move: We need to call customer service. We contact the companies we have accounts with and we tell them we tried selling our GME shares but their platforms are messed up and they aren't letting us sell like we would normally be able to do. Their websites are broken at this point and they think they're having some serious technically difficulties (which they are because of us tards). We tell them to allow us to sell our shares at the price of $420,000,000.01 because that's what we had our limit sell orders for. Under the US SEC Code No. 42069, they are required to sell our shares at the limit price we chose assuming it reached that price while we were hodling on to the stock (you can view this code in source 2). All of our companies will be required to sell us the shares at the splendid price of $420,000,000.01 despite the price of the stock falling due to us selling our shares. So the brokerage companies will have to take money out of their own pockets to sell us the shares at our limit price while the stock is falling far below the limit price. This will bankrupt the companies we have brokerage accounts with but thats okay because they're dumb.

Step 6: Now that we have simultaneously destroyed the hedge funds, destroyed the brokerage companies, and become jizzillionaires, we can now finally buy some decent tendies and enjoy our stay on the moon.

tl;dr: HODL. Then, wait till GME is at $4.2 million per share. Then, set up limit sells and limit buys right above and right below $4.2 million, respectively. Then, wait till a slight price fluctuation occurs. Then, stock market goes cachonk. Then, we use legal stuff to force brokerage companies to sell our shares to us at our sell limit price. Then, we all cash out after destroying society. Then, we buy yummy tendies. EZ.",Some financial advice for you retards invested in GME,1.0,1615523455,BoredInClassRightNow
