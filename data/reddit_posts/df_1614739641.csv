3,lwjcgf,"Before you take my order of french fries and a large frosty I wanted to tell you a story... 

I’m a long time lurker in the WSB and I have been following the GME saga since December, unfortunately I jumped in too late so I bought 4 shares at 350 on Jan 28th and I have been holding them with my life, also I kept buying more to average down.

I have the same mentally as most of people here… **I believe in the company and all the changes it’s doing so, I do believe that even if the SS doesn’t happen having GME stock is an amazing investment.** 

But fear not, there is enough evidence to know that **it’s not a matter of “if the SS happens or not, is just a matter of WHEN it’s going to happen”**

ANYWAYS… what I wanted to say is, **when the MOASS happens you need to be prepared, specially, mentally prepared for the ultra bumpy ride.** 

I have the feeling that everyone here thinks that once the rocket takes off everything is going to be a smooth ride and you just need to wait for the perfect time to sell and become rich… I have bad news for you, it won’t be like that.

If you think that this last weeks between HFs hiding information, media publishing shitty articles about why you shouldn’t invest in GME, a bald dude on T.V. talking crap about the stock or Reddit, all the short ladder attacks, bots, shills, lying to the Congress…etc… is crazy, just wait until this thing explodes.

**I presume most of us, or probably all of us, have seen a movie where a space ship goes through an asteroid belt?  That’s going to be our rocket, that’s going to be this forum and it’s going to be pandemonium.**

I do believe and admire the collective wisdom (this is the reason why all the DDs we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes, for what it matters is the same).

However, I do also believe in mass panic, and panic and fear are really strong emotions.

Every single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time **logic, intelligence and incredible well done DDs are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control**. (Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)

Greed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40’s range.

In this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. 

Don’t forget **it’s not the same a HF having a “civilized” fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000…5,000….10,000.**

**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**

So, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. 

And I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.

However, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... 

 **tl;dr:** **DON’T PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**

Disclaimer: Current shares holding below; all my debit calls are now maxed out.

https://preview.redd.it/kzs2e1tl6qk61.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57e524edb5cc6cdee27978228fae57396ab7ce12

I posted this AM ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt\_ddtendies\_part\_2\_decent\_amount\_of\_squeeze\_left/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt_ddtendies_part_2_decent_amount_of_squeeze_left/)) regarding more squeezing when the price was $28.  I thought it would trade sideways and then a crazy afterhours.  Seems the covering occurred early for an explosive afternoon.  I believe the stock will still squeeze more, even to triple digits, as all the ITM call options get exercised this Friday.  **Additionally, there are 03/19 call options up to $50, which mean additional gamma squeeze from options still exists**.  

Interestingly, the despite the short covering, **shorts have increased bringing the total up to 46% or 46% float (data from S3:** [**https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801**](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801)**).**  

**All Catalyst events:**

1) Blowout earnings, and excellent forecast to be successful even when, eventually the interest rates go up.  Remember at the end of the day this is a **profitable** company.

2) Special dividend of 1.11 on 03/08/20.  Other than bleeding the shorts for this dividend, people may recall their shares back to get this true dividend.

3) Increased publicity tomorrow  [https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx) 

4) Large institutional ownership and unlikely that the majority shareholders will sell at this point.  They want to trigger a squeeze

5) Rising short interest with a 50% borrowing fee.  There were no shares left to borrow by 11 am and that's why the stock quickly 'rocketed up'.  Currently there are only 15000 shares left to borrow at this time (and none for the few hours after market close) and they will probably be borrowed first thing AM.

6) I have heard more OTM options may be written by the end of this week.

Given the huge runup this week, I'm much more conservative and suggest buying shares or ITM debit spreads, but for the more cavalier of you can buy some OTM 03/19 or, if they make new options this week, some OTM 03/05 options.

**Addendum:** I am not a bot, HF, shill, or a professional investor.  I am not anti-GME and do not think we should all jump ship to RKT.  However, this play, in the short term, appears the most promising.","RKT Day 2 - Big squeeze today, but more to come (increased shorts) 🚀🚀",0.65,1614740272,Fun_Paleontologist_2
