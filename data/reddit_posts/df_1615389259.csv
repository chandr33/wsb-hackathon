33,m1zroc,"Hi! So I’ve been in the market since the outbreak of GME so I’m a newbie. I didn’t have the chance to obtain the enormous gains from the GME pump and when it dropped I believed that it wouldn’t go up anymore (big mistake on my end). I saw it at 23-24$ and was almost certain into joining the gang but a friend of mine dissuaded me. I saw it later at 95$ and cried myself to sleep because of the gains I missed. Now, even worse since it’s at 280$... But I’m not regretting it that much since mistakes teach the most (the ones that cost money even more). So my question now is if it’s a good idea to invest in GME (buy 1-2 shares cuz I’m poor) or wait for a drop in price. I haven’t researched the stock since from what I know it moves mainly on the fans and “apes” supporting it. What is your advice on this topic ?

Thanks for the answers in advance!

You've seen all the DD already: in 5 years, mostly all EV's you see and the one you will be driving will be powered by BB and Amazon, the security software your company uses will probably be Cylance, and John Chen will be sitting right next to Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Ryan Cohen as the tech lords of the world.

Imagine being John Chen right now. All the man needs is 10 days at a price of $30/share for him to get paid out 90 million dollars. No that is not a typo. The man is in it just as much as we are. He's even posted about the moon and added a winky face on Twitter - he was hoping for a Ryan Cohen result, but didn't get it. Can't fault the Boomer man for trying.

The man at the top usually feasts first, but nowadays we've levelled the playing field. We all eat.
