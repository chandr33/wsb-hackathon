65,lxiwev,"According to the E-Trade trading representative that I spoke with this morning, I'm unable to restrict my current or future GME shares from being ""hypothecated"", i.e. borrowed, because I hold a margin account. And the only way to accomplish this is to remove the margin designation from my account.

E-Trade's wait time can be horrendous, and for tards without spare time to hold for a rep., what's above is my result for reference.

Now, I'll have to check with my other brokerages.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update:

Ally Brokerage doesn't immediately allow you to restrict the borrowing of your shares. The rep. informed me that I can either opt out of the income program or she can submit a request on behalf to the back office and provide me a confirmation number.

I decided to opt-out since it's time sensitive. It'll take 1-2 days to process.

Well...here I am again looking at my Tesla 3/5 1000c down 98% -$2400 holding strong 💎🤲 and 🙏 for a miracle. The wife’s bulls said i should place a stop loss but what do they know. 

While I wait for one of Papa Musks celestial tweets I found a pretty decent short term play in Costco earnings after hours today. It almost feels like free money.....almost cuz the market is probably gonna take a poo poo.

Price per share is currently at $322.25 with expected eps of 2.42. That’s a 15% increase YoY and that’s not even accounting for the fact that they most likely will be reporting 2.45-2.52 EPS. Have you been to a Costco lately?  The day of Q2 earnings, the price per share reached a high of $314. There is a huge discrepancy between current price and fair value.

Costco is the only company that is competing with Amazon because they have a loyal customer base that is seeking true value in their products. The current price drop is not correlated to business financials but short term sentiment drop on the macro level. 

Have you been to a Costco lately?They’re packed every time I go and come on, can you beat $1.50 hot dog and soda. NO. The answer is NO,YOU CANNOT...unless you add that two dollar slice of pepperoni heaven just to round out the meal. Hey Carl Icahn and Bill Ackerman, did I mention CHURROS are officially back. It’s a done deal. What else do you need to know?

Buying Apr 16 $320c on open and averaging down if it dips.

I could be totally wrong and SPY could go to $355 so do your DD. GL tards 

TLDR buy $COST before earnings and if it dips after earnings. 4/16 $320c",$COST Earnings today AH...easy money,0.59,1614859697,CandyLandSavant
