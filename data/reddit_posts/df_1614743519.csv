This is discussion is to just bring awareness to some issues that have been occurring on the subreddit. I'm going to try to avoid bringing my own opinion into this as that doesn't matter. With the millions of new members that have recently joined, there has been a lot of known and unknown misinformation and I've really noticed that it's primarily been in the comments section. 

Now I know the spotlight has been on GME for the past 3ish months but you all really have to remember that this is NOT a GME subreddit. It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content.

**INFO**

There has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content. Now I have no idea whether this is true or not, however, please do not go spreading info around if you are not informed. There have also been posts and comments about ""tactics that short-sellers"" use to manipulate the stock  (that I'm not going to name), which aren't even real tactics. Please, don't just take posts or comments about certain info with a ""grain"" of salt or even a ""pinch"". Take the info you see with a **fist full of salt**. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!! PLEASE!

**""\_\_\_\_ is a distraction from \_\_\_\_\_""**

(this section is where I am mostly biased on) Please. Not everything is a distraction from GME or whatever is the hottest play on WSB. There are literally thousands of other stocks that can be bought or sold. I've seen some people say that they are suspicious of RKT because it came ""out of nowhere"" when there have been dozens of DDs since the stock came onto the market. I've seen comments like ""nIcE tRY heDGieS""....okay right manipulate and trick retail traders to trade over 350M+ shares of RKT so we forget about the past 3 months of GME? Trust me, when you open this subreddit, you almost only see GME. There is no need to remind everyone of the GME short-squeeze. 

**""Where do you get these plays from?""**

You can filter the spam and the memes by filtering by DD mode from the daily thread. There are some AMAZING DDs on this sub, you just have to look for them. Remember to do your own research. DDs should not be your only source of info and make sure the DD has some links to their sources or you can ask the OP. You should primarily look at DDs as simply bring awareness to a company for you to look at, and after further research, you can then decide.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. Have a good day :)",Information and DDs on WSB,0.91,1614743536,fortuneftb2329

6,lwkitg,"Hi fellow WSB,

$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. 

1.	GM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. 

2.	GM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.

3.	GM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.

4.	GM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.

5.	GM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! 

6.	Apple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.

7.	Famous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.

8.	President Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.

9.	Chip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.

10.	Newly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).

Megabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.
