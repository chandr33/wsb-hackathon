* On July 17, 2019 LIPA first notified FuelCell that the new CLCPA would negate energy credits for the LIPA 2 and LIPA 3 projects.
* Continuous dilution of shares: Between January 2020 and January 2021, common shares outstanding increased 53%, from 210,965,999 to 322,412,341.  
* \~15X increase in price driven by retail while business prospects have not changed at all:

**Fake it till you make strategy it will soon run out steam and retail investors will abandon the stock.** 

* Less than 4% of the stock is held by insiders. This points to lack of insider conviction in the company
* Institutional ownership is low at below 1/3. Why is smart money not investing?
* Current ratio is about 4. Debt to equity ratio is 77.

Below this article was released about 30 minutes ago, but wall street has not started processing the ramifications of what this article states, but one needs to act fast.  

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber)

To Summarize the article below “ALL SMS TEXTING has been exposed and any hacker as of now has the ability to take over your cell phone numbers and receive your texts without knowing. SMS has been for comprised for who knows how long and has been run by an unregulated company. We have no idea how long the fix will take and what comes next.

To help all the autists on this sub to see how big of a deal this is below is the linear play by play of what this means:

Linear steps below

With a phone number sms someone can takeover an email account -à get username of bank account -à reset password -à SMS TEXT TO CONFIRM à now have access to venmo/bank account/ your negative robinhood account etc etc

Every company has been over-relying on SMS authentication for account security the last 5 years and this is going to have ramifications across the telecommunications industry

&amp;#x200B;

THE PLAY – GAY BEAR 10X BAGGER WITH TWLO PUTS

&amp;#x200B;

TWLO makes the majority of its revenue by usage of helping companies send out SMS with its SMS API.  With SMS jeopardized we will start seeing companies stop relying as much on sms authentication,  this will cause TWLO SMS revenue to decrease.   

RISKS:

We do not know how long the fix will take, but from my understanding it could possibly be a month or two
