12,m6c0o8,"TLDR - Oil is going to boom.  Buy $GUSH

Apes.  Listen up.  The world is slowly emerging from this pandemic.  China is largely out of it.  America is coming out of it.  Everyone in America who wants a vaccination will be able to get one by this summer, maybe sooner.  Travel restrictions are going to be lifted.  You know what's going to happen?  People are going to lose their motherfucking minds and they are going to take all that unused vacation and $GME money and TRAVEL!  

The pandemic crushed oil.  $GUSH went from $1462 a share on Dec. 1, 2019 to $15.66 a share on March 1, 2020.  The world shut down.  Travel stopped.  No cruises, few flights, people cooped up in their houses.  The price crashed and the oil companies started closing wells and could not move product.  If you're like me, you filled up your car once in the March 20 - June 20 timeframe.

When the world fully emerges from this pandemic people are going to travel.  See family.  Just get away.  People are saving money, a lot of money.  People are saving vacation time, a lot vacation time.  People are going to fly, cruise, drive, all over the world and the oil companies are not going to ramp up production (on purpose) fast enough which will create supply issues while demand is sky high which will push the price sky high and the oil companies will use that to try and recoup losses they suffered during the pandemic before political pressure builds to the point where they have to increase production and get price down.  This will be especially true for places like Russia where their economy really depends on oil.  Obviously the OPEC countries in the Middle East too.

$GUSH is going to rocket with all that demand.  Does it get back to $1462 a share or higher?  Maybe.  However, what if it only gets back to $500 a share but you bought it today at $81.50 a share?  Still a pretty nice payday.  Only recovers to $250 a share?  Still doing good.  Buy $GUSH.

I am a retarded ape who farts in the bathtub and tries to bite the bubbles.  This is not financial advice, its just a theory.",Oil. Buy $GUSH,1.0,1615909571,chucksniper85

Long time lurker here, This is basically my porn account that I added investing subreddits to back in Jan, so old account with no karma. 

I have a theory that we might see red days till Friday before the liftoff. Part of me thinks that the nice good guy whale will try to trigger SSR with drops at or near open to keep the bad guys from shorting excessively and let  the price creep up for the rest of the day. In the past week we mostly traded sideways during SSR days 'cause the baddies only shorted on uptick which led to canceling out the upward pressure that was there. So I think we might be taking some red crayons up the butt for the next few days... stil holding

Its not only this sub that have a short squeeze analyses prediction. Must be pointed out, besides all the FUD and shills, WSB apes have proven time and time again that they were correct.

If you stop for a second and look at your daily chart you will see a ”cup and handle formation” now on a  bull sentiment with a stronger potential than the move we saw last week, in March 8th. So hold your feeble baby monkey hands and get that Alpha-ape-diamond-grip on.

There are other analyst looking into GME right now and observing the same potential.

Read the article: (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/gamestop-stock-tumbles-but-analyst-still-sees-squeeze-potential-51615905053)

“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be one of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky.

Disaniwsky is on GME’s side here. 

But PRICE MUST HOLD!!!! This is the most important part.

If you paper hands, all this effort is done. Finito, nothing!

Are you letting the HFs getting your tendies or are you going to show what your big ape hands are made of?

While the market is bullshit, and you should never hinge on timing or dates, it can serve as an indication for when to load the rocket. Especially if the crayons are confirmed by reality later on.

&amp;#x200B;

***METHOD***

* For easier reading of trends, Heikin Ashi sticks are used. For ape who don't know, green = STONKS. red = NOT STONKS
* Prices in bubbles are from regular candles (probably), as HA-candles are bad at showing actual open-close prices.

&amp;#x200B;

***BANANAS***

* Roughly 1 month trading cycle from the OPEN of first non-squeeze to beginning of next non-squeeze.
* The Big Shortening happens over exactly 2 trading weeks, from monday 1st week to friday on 2nd week.

&amp;#x200B;

***CRAYON 1***

* Assuming the same percent increase OPEN-to-OPEN, the current Big Shortening should end on 2021-04-01 (that's 1/4 for retarded). This is a Thursday because Jesus.
*  The OPEN on 5/4 being the same % above previous, places us at roughly $110

*Processing img 2y77pdshren61...*

***CRAYON 2***

* Assuming the same pullback as previous Big Shortening (-87%)
* The OPEN on 5/4 is somewhere around $37

Embracer  Group is noted on the Swedish First North  exchange which is not as regulated as ""normal"" exhanges are. There is  also not the same ruleset for tax in most countries so be aware of this.  It is also said to be more risky investments.

They operate in the game development and publishing business and I don't really need to dive into the prospect of this sector.

Embracer Group ([EMBRAC-B.ST](https://embrac-b.st/))  is the parent company of several development and publishing business  within the gaming industry and throughout most platforms including  mobile, console and PC.

To name a couple of well known items in their IP inventory:

* Valheim (if you don't know yet this is going to be a catalyst)
* Saints Row
* Goat Simulator

**The company**

They operate Koch Media, Cofee Stain, Amplifier, Saber, Deca and a group containing banned chars (similar to a ticker) as operative groups.

They hold 220+ IP's, 59 development studios, the 6 above operative groups with 5500+ people in 40+ countries.

*Strategic plans*

Grabbing from the 2019/2020 annual report page 6 highlights:

* Investment for long-term growth
* Growth through M&amp;A
* Empowerment through decentralization (reference to several dev. and pub. branches)
* Reinvesting profit to increase growth

*Let's see what they've done about it* with referencing their press releases ([https://embracer.com/news-media/](https://embracer.com/news-media/)):

* 2021-02-03: Merge with Easybrain (Mobile games as Sudoku and so on)
* 2021-02-03: Acquires Aspyr Media (Star Wars, Sid Meier's Civilization etc.)
* 2021-02-03: Merge with Gearbox Entertainment Company (Borderlands)
* 2020-11-18: Acquires Flying Wild Hog (Shadow Warrior series)

...

Seems like they took M&amp;A serious.. If you're interested, theres a presentation of the M&amp;A actions here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update\_Feb\_3\_2021-ny.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update_Feb_3_2021-ny.pdf)

We  can't go about without mentioning Valheim. The viking survival game  that is currently running early access on Steam and had over 4 million  buys came February. The game has taken the industry with storm. As of  writing there's 18k viewers on twitch which is close to Overwatch and  Hearthstone.

It was release the 2nd of February through Steam with a 96% positive feedback.

**Financials (*****sort of*****)**

First  looking at the gaming market which has been reported from 2018 to 139  billion USD to 2019 ranging in 152 billions. Estimates for 2022 is close  to 200 billion.

Second, insider  holdings. The insiders account for 52.7% of the shares with 35.5% being  on institutional hands. The remainder for trade is 11.8%.

The Q4 report arrrives the 20th of May.

The report is a bit difficult for my smooth brain to compare since the previous year is for 15 months so bear with me.

Net sales grew from \~4603m SEK to \~5249m SEK.

Operational EBIT grew from \~717m SEK to \~1033m SEK.

I'm not yet that experiences in reading the financial reports so I won't bore you with my mistakes. It can be found here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf)

From  my limited knowledge I see increases on almost all areas worth noting  which is also impressive considering that the previous period is a 15  month period (I don't know why).

90,m6cf5g,"So here I am, trying to find another stock to buy. And I don't know currently.

I have AMC, which seeing that the pandemic will end soon, means that theaters will be open to people who have been quarantining for too long (Unless Netflix and Amazon videos made Movie Theaters obsolete by now).

I have SNDL, which with the Cannabis reform happening in the Federal govt. may cause this and other Cannabis stocks to spike (at least it makes sense in my head).

Right now though, I don't know what else I can get into. I need an idea of where I should go next.",Looking for another bit of inspiration.,1.0,1615910629,tophat212
