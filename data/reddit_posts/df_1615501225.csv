0,m32d9i,"Quick DD on NVAX as I believe they will still be undervalued due to lack of press and the majority of people not paying attention to their market cap compared PFE, MRNA, JNJ, etc.  
NVAX just dropped the best vaccine news - 100% protection against severe disease (using JnJ’s new twist on words to lower the efficacy bar). Now NVAX has demonstrated best in class efficacy amongst all vax producers and has completed trials that were occurring where escape variants were rampant. 
They will likely still be severely undervalued until UK approval. Market cap is nothing compared to their competitors. 
So many catalysts now imminent - UK approval, US/Mexico trial data, US approval, Canada approval, delivery for billions of doses under contract with several countries, bivalent and multivalent strains currently being mapped while single escape variant strains are in testing and should be approved faster than original strain vaccines according to FDA and MHRA, most well tolerated vaccine (similar to flu shot, same tech), easy transportation and storage (reg fridge temp), superior flu vaccine (Nanoflu) in pipeline according to ph 3 data (past ph 3), Nanoflu has been mentioned as being combined with Covid vaccine for annual jabs, RSV vaccine also in pipeline. Every catalyst will rocket them due to market cap.

19,m32eyo,"Ok I know everyone says ""Tmr this, tmr that, tmr moon, next week blah blah"" etc, and yeah it's probably more likely that nothing's gonna happen again tomorrow lmao. But here's why I still think it's going to be great for AMC:

***1) Industry trend:***

Cinemark: Earnings call 2/26/21 8AM ET (premarket), price dropped about 10% between 2/24/21 and EOD 2/26/21, increased 6.5% on 2/27/21, increased a little more for a few days. CNK did **not** beat EPS expectations (-$1.46 expected vs -$2.03 actual).

IMAX: Earnings call 3/3/21 4:30PM ET (AH), price dropped about 4.5% on 3/4/21, and increased 18.7% on 3/5/21. IMAX also did **not** beat EPS expectations (-$0.20 expected vs -$0.21 actual).

**AMC**: Earnings call 3/10/11 5PM ET (AH), price dropped about 6.5% from 3/9/21 to EOD 3/10/11 leading up to the earnings call (despite the intraday jump to \~$12s), 4.37% increase 3/11/11 which is mediocre or almost sideways I would say given AMC's current inherent volatility (I know this isn't the most fair and is a biased statement). **Then tomorrow? Maybe Monday?** Yeah again, sorry for sounding like all those other posts ""tmr this, tmr that"". But AMC **met** EPS expectations (-$3.15 expected vs -$3.15 actual); **did not fall behind expectations for the first time in many quarters.** Also, AMC **beat** revenue expectations by a quite large margin ($142.3 expectations vs $162.5m actual).

***2) Short interest per figures reported to and by FINRA:***

Yes the short interests data are reported after \~10 days and not fully reflective of today's ""reality"". But I think it is still relevant as the data's publicity is kept confidential/unavailable until the reporting date. And, check this out: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)

1/15/21 short data, reported around 1/27/21: $386 million. **What happened on 1/27/21?**

1/29/21 short data, reported around 2/9/21: $219 million (big decrease due to short positions having covered). Not much happened.

2/12/21 short data, reported around 2/24/21: $386 million. **$5.70 on 2/19/21, $9.09 on 2/24/21**

2/26/21 short data, reported around 3/9/21: $547 million. **$547 MILLION.** Are we going to the Moon or UrAnus? 

We've seen some good increases recently, but looking at the prices I personally don't believe hedgies (or whatever institutions or whales or individuals who shorted) were able to (or intended to) cover much of $547 million since 2/26/21 (date of short data) up to now.

***3) Way too many good prospects (aka FORWARD GUIDANCE):***

Many people and YouTubers have already covered these so I will only list a few. All of you would know how bright the prospects are if you actually listened through the earnings call yesterday or/and are half interested in this company. CEO Adam was a FUCKING BOSS who sounded very much like he held the ownership and willingness to get AMC out of bunch of bullshit and get it going. Yes obviously he should sound like he's on the company's positive side but not all companies' earnings call give positive future guidance. When companies do present negative future guidance, that's when the stock fucking tanks

\- CEO has been in active talks with Gavin Newsom (CA governor) to reopen theaters in Los Angeles, the biggest movie market

\- Los Angeles highly likely to reopen theatres on 3/19/21, and if they don't, they will soon enough

\- PEOPLE LIKE MOVIES! As CEO Adam said himself, bears have been saying movie theatres are dead for YEARS but they aren't. Favorite spot for cheap ass mofos who want to go on a date while on a budget. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of movies, but the last thing I did before COVID shutdown was watching a movie on 3/22/20 or 3/23/20. It was literally the last day before countywide lockdown happened in Los Angeles. I also have not watched Tenet yet (huge fan of Christopher Nolan; watched Interstellar 55 times) just because I wanted to watch it in the movies

\- No one knows about the long term future and quite possibly the movie theatres may not stand strong years later, but for the upcoming short-term future, there **will** be an electric return and momentum which would further positively affect the stock. It does not matter if AMC was doing bad pre-COVID; the two situations are not comparable as many other variables have entered since. **We are trying to move forward from here on out, not just reverse back to pre-COVID era.** This ain't no finger snap shit. Stock prices don't really move rationally at all although all these analysts make their analysis sound very rational. Another reason to just ignore them sometimes. Not saying they are always on the wrong or something, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

And as much as the points above may not have any positive effects, the share recount is tbh really not going to have much of an effect. Naked shorts are illegal and yes I understand that there have been precedents of naked shorts (notably GME, very much implied although cannot be 100% certain), but I don't think the practice of it is as prevalent as ppl make or conspire it out to be. It won't have much of an effect; just a personal opinion as with this entire post.

As for just the general shorting practice, A borrows AMC from B, sells it to C, and does **not** have a predetermined timeline to go purchase a stock to pay the stock back to A (i.e. covering/closing out their short position). B only has to close out their position if A explicitly wants it back or B is margin called. But A typically does not want it back quickly; i.e. short positions typically do not have a deadline to close. But until they are closed, B will be paying variable interest on them as you all know. If B does not cover, then the stock is legally owned by C, and **that's it. C has the right to participate in the shareholder meeting (in May) as of the share count date (today?) and that's it. A does not have the right or the ownership unless he buys another separate share. B does not and never had the shareholder's right.** Just wanted to reiterate this as quite a few people seemingly did not seem to understand this.

**TL;DR - BUY AMC shares, HOLD**, MAYBE BUY AMC call options too (I have good amounts of 3/19c $10, 3/19c $14). **But,** SELL any of those whenever you want obviously. Please don't forget you gotta make your own judgments on when you have to sell. No one here is going to help you or me, or be on your side (not talking about on your side mentally but talking about on your side *as a result*; result being your positive income. Doesn't matter if someone tried to be sincerely on your side. Only matters if you make money; let's be honest) as a when it comes to profit taking, the hardest thing to do. If someone sells, someone else is left a bagholder. If the price reaches $1k or $69,420, and if there are 1000 apes, not all 1000 apes are going to be able to sell at $1k or $69,420 altogether. It just can't happen. Again, some people seem to be putting themselves oblivious to this very basic idea.

## Abused by the rich?

I have never heard of this. Must be a loophole for the wealthy. Are QOF investments profitable? Is it a safe place to store short term capital gains? 

## Or a real charity?

Do these funds actually help people? Please link some examples if you have some. I would be more than happy to give back through charity. I don’t deserve this money, I’d spend it on some oceanfront beach house and steak lunches. I would rather invest creating financial opportunities for my people.

37,m32iqk,"CPNG is a South Korean E-commerce company, dubbed, the ""Amazon of Korea"". Bill Ackman said CPNG is one of the best investments he's ever made. Upon closer look, it's very quite clear why he would say that.

Unlike Amazon, CPNG offers free same-day delivery without limiting their available inventory. CPNG has their own private fleet of delivery drivers and fulfillment centers and thus has insane amount of flexibility and control over how they deliver and ship items. Not only that, they are like DASH in that they deliver food and drinks from local vendors.

Their unique ""Dawn Delivery"" service allows users to make orders at night and receive items early next morning. Returns can be processed instantaneously with money refunded as soon as the item is scanned. It's no wonder in such a short amount of time, CPNG has dominated the South Korean E-commerce Market.  


**Contention 1: But South Korea is small!**  
\-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years.

\-They’re quiet about expansion plans, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle.

\-Also, South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea’s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don’t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. It's why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven’t. In short, a Korean company nowadays has much greater potential reaching South East Asia and the West than China or Japan.  


**Notable Investors:**  
\-Bill Ackman, Softbank, Blackrock, Sequoia Capital, and more.  


**Intangibles:**  
\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma’s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.

\-CPNG’s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I’ve ever seen to come out of South Korea since ever. This guy is cut above—this guy will say he “cares first about his customers” and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, Brian Chesky, and now, this guy.

\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010.

\-Kim’s motto: I envision a world where people will say, “How could I have ever lived without Coupang”.

  
**Contention 2: Growth stocks are out of favor in a high interest rate environment!**  
\-Possibly a bigger problem. As per many pundits on CNBC and Bloomberg, the growth potential of CPNG specifically will depend heavily on earnings. With the talented CEO and revenue beat year after year, I believe CPNG will make it.  


**TLDR** \- CPNG is the best Korean E-commerce company that has its own robust infrastructure and an articulate CEO that plans to grow its operations significantly in the next year.

**Strat:** I'm buying lots of hundreds of shares to sell covered calls, which will have very high premiums when the options market opens. I did this with PLTR and ABNB.","Bull Case for CPNG - Insane Growth Potential if ""growth"" is not an issue",1.0,1615501658,jameskwonlee

Anyway, yesterday in another sub some people said $GME is just gambling while I argued it is also an investment, so I just want to recap main points:

&amp;#x200B;

* Console supercycle: easy one, this should boost $GME revenue this year and probably next one if we compare it to previous cycles.
* Malls re-opening: easy also, Texas is now open and many states will re-open during the next months. Revenue boost also.
* Ryan Cohen: chairman, leading the business transformation, Chewy, etc.
* New business and product lines: gaming hardware, exclusive deals with Nintendo, Microsoft etc. Also GME followed Steam on Twitter and it seems they want to go big into the eSports. We will see in a few weeks how this plays out.

Many people said it is a company that is losing money so I look into the financials and here is what I found...

Basic EPS went down to -7.23$ in 2018 according to Tradingview, so I looked into the cause. They had a huge unsual expense of 1 billion in 2018 and 400 million in 2019, so I went into the 10K of 2019 and apparently this was caused by goodwill impairment:

"" **In order to test goodwill for impairment, we compare a reporting unit's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the excess.** In fiscal 2019, we estimated the fair value of our United States segment by using a combination of the income approach and market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows, which are derived from our long-term financial forecasts, and requires significant assumptions including, among others, a discount rate and a terminal value. The market approach is based on the observed ratios of enterprise value to earnings of the Company and other comparable, publicly-traded companies. We recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $363.9 million and $970.7 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. See Note 7, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" for additional information. No goodwill impairment charges related to our continuing operations were recognized in fiscal 2017. ""

&amp;#x200B;

And it continued: 

&amp;#x200B;

"" We have historically performed an impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired (see Note 1, ""Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies""). **During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we determined that a triggering event occurred as a result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization**; therefore, we performed an interim impairment test for our goodwill. As a result of the interim impairment test, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $363.9 million related to our United States segment. We have no remaining goodwill as a result of the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $970.7 million related to our continuing operations. No goodwill impairment charges related to continuing operations were recognized in fiscal 2017. ""

So if I am interpreting this correctly, losses are not caused by business operations, but by accounting policies (FASB). So because market cap declined and revenue declined they recognised goodwill impairment and that make the net income go negative.

So looking more into another metric, operating income it was +310 million in 2018 and +45 million in 2019 and -175 million in 2020 (TTM) according to tradingview. Gross profit and revenue also declined. So yes you could think ""it is a dead business"", but maybe not. 2020 losses could be explained due to the lockdowns which killed brick and mortar, so main thing here is declining revenue and a business model that is not sustainable...

Meet Ryan Cohen, who make Chewy revenue grow 500% from 2016 to 2019, while growing gross profit around 1000%. Let's say he can grow revenue 100% in the next 4 years in $GME (I think it is a modest assumption), this would mean $GME revenue would grow to around 12 billion, gross profit would expand probably to around 4-5 billion. Substract operating expenses of 1.8 billion taking 2019 numbers and you have a business with 2-3 billion in operating income.

Now if I am correct when interpreting financial statements, this would wipe out the goodwill impairment, therefore making the company profitable and with EPS that could range from 5 to 10$ and that could even pay a dividend.

Now put a PE ratio of 40 (sp500 is around that) and you have a 200$ to 400$ stock.

Of course my thesis could be wrong. Do your due dilligence. Not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: If Cohen makes the revenue grow, $GME could be back to profitability and with current sp500 pe ratio, price could be on the hundreds.

Arkk = ""ark"" = Noah's ark, famous ship that saved all the retarded animals from drowning, including apes

Noah's Ark is made of, guess what? Wood

Cathie Wood = Wood = Erection, which is what I get when I think of PLTR mooning.

But also, Wood = Trees = Treehouse, which is what Alex Karp lives in. Alex Karp lives in a treehouse.

In summation: Erection. Tree house. Qi Gong. Cathie's Arkk. Has there ever been clearer evidence of an incoming moon? Don't think so.

Now for some DD. Some crossover from [u/Shandowarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shandowarden) 

What is Root? 
Root is a car insurance company, but also a data technology SaaS company.  Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. 
There are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https://legiscan.com/OR/text/SB173/id/2236077) See [WA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&amp;Year=2021&amp;Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  

What does this mean?  Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. ""Doesn't progressive already do this?"" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.  

Alternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. 

Root has very little debt: $209M

And lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash / investments with its subsidiaries. This cash alone represents roughly 46% of the current ($2.8B) market cap. 

$LMND has a market cap of $6.3B (2/3rds of it's peak 3 months ago).  If $ROOT were to match that market cap of $6.3B (which arguably should be higher), we'd be looking around roughly $25 per share, let alone a short squeeze greater than GME... 

TLDR:  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  ROOT is a tech based insurance company also selling SaaS via data and telematics.  Data is transforming the world, and the insurance industry is incredibly behind.  Data companies such as this one will be here to stay, if not acquired by other insurance companies.  

position: 277 shares @ $11.92, and 10 4/16 $12.50 calls - Will be scooping up 723 more shares next Tuesday, currently capped on RH instant deposit.
