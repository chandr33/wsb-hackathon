Second. I understand no one here is anything other thabk a bunch of apes who just like the stocks. And anything that is told here is not ""legal advise from an accountant and blah blah blah"" whatever the words that need to be used are.

And third. I understand the concept of buy low, sell high.

But what my question is, is should I be selling high and buying low within the same stock? Or should I be selling high in one stock, and putting those gains into a different stock thats at a good buying dip? Or does it not really matter?

TL:DR, do I keep my buy low/sell high money within the same stock? Or move it around different stocks as they fluctuate?

Micro-strategy, Tesla, Square and PayPal have been getting all the attention lately with the rise of digital asset related stocks. BRPHF is however a XBT whale that has been holing onto  16,402 coins which cost them approximately 134 million on Jun 30th 2020.  Now that treasury has a total worth of around 930 million while price per share is still stable around $14.30.

[https://bitcointreasuries.org](https://bitcointreasuries.org)

Over the last year BRPHF has increased its comprehensive income over 650% in the last quarter of 2020. Net book value has increased over 75% in the fourth quarter of 2020.  The company is known for its loans which its loan book grew over 300% to more than 110 million. 

Overall this is a company that has been overlooked with regard to its digital asset holdings. As we see expansion and growth in that sector I can see enormeorus growth.

51,m5nkzb,"The last year was tough. I've got a kid to feed, you know. So I've been here looking to make some money alongside the rest of you apes, and I was willing to take the risk. When GME dropped to less than 50 only a week after record highs, I knew things were not over. So I bought in and have been happily watching the gains these past few weeks.

Thing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say ""would have been"" because I did not buy that option. Not because I didn't want to, but because I wasn't ALLOWED to do so. What gives? The little guy can't get access to real trading strategies? Wall Street has to screw us over like that?

I mean hey, I understand having to ask for approval first. Accept the risks and all that. So fine, I did that. Robinhood gave me a big FU. Fidelity, which has been my brokerage app, said I needed to wait a few days. On Friday I was told I got approved. Awesome. All good now, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm a little guy, so the only position I am entitled to is being screwed.

This week I decided to start small, grab a Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 2k in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22. How can I ever get experience if you won't let me try?

Is it fair to say Wall Street has been quite literally taking food out of my kid's mouth? Because I think that's fair to say. Maybe you agree that it should be difficult to get approved for options trading. That opinion is incompatible with a YOLO play, so get out of here.

--------

1) They sell the F150, the #1 selling truck to apes in the USA (with an EV version coming out next year) 

2) They are acquiring large partnerships with companies like Rivian and VW

3) The skateboard platform is scalable and well thought out for EV implementation across multiple vehicles, reducing overhead costs

4) They are coming out with a new, light weight, smaller than the Ranger, truck called the Maverick. It is potentially going to be EV

5) They are bringing the Ranger Raptor to the USA, which will sell like hot bananas because every ape will want one

6) They just released the Ford Bronco

7) They are releasing a new V8 F150 Raptor that will be 750 HP that uses the GT500 motor

8) They just released the all electric Mach E, which is a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y

9) They're investing with VW in Argo AI, a self driving technology platform

10) They are investing in 3d printing car parts for their automotive sandbox

11) They're investing in Solid Power, to put ASSB solid state batteries in their future EV's

12) The Mach E is fully eligible for the $7500 tax rebate, Tesla has exhausted their tax rebate

13) Ford cannot hardly keep Mach E's or Bronco's on the lot for longer than a day or two at most. My retarded opinion is that they'll have even more trouble producing EV trucks fast enough to even see a sales lot.
