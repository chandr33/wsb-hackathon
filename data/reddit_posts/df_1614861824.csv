Wanted to post an update from Ortex this morning showing the following

1. Free Float Short Interest has not budged, in fact it increased since the run from the 21ish
2. Borrow fees have skyrocketed
3. Look at the similarities between GME and RKT...it appears today and tomorrow will be interesting days

Now I'm not saying that RKT is GME, but they have similar patterns in their charts/short interest and RKT has 2 pretty insane catalysts upcoming that shorts will have to deal with

1. Dividend of $1.11/sh they will have to pay if they don't cover by close on 3/5 (tomorrow)
2. $1B buyback that they could drop the hammer at any time

Positions : 6k shares and 25x $25 3/5 calls...will add on any dip

$SKT, or Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and one 
of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. It is the only publicly 
traded ""pure-play"" for outlet centers. The founder, Stanley K. Tanger, entered the outlet business in 1981 
and the company was taken public in June 1993.




🚀🚀 

SKT owns or has ownership interest in a portfolio of 40 upscale outlet shopping 
centers totaling 14.4 million square feet, located in 21 states and in Canada. Its properties are leased to 
over 3,100 stores and 510 different brand name companies. Its outlet centers range in size from 82,000 to 
nearly 750,000 square feet.




🚀🚀🚀
 
Outlet centers are generally operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell 
branded products, but specifically made for the outlet distribution channel. This allows them to sell to 
consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department and specialty stores. 
Each of SKT's outlet centers, except for one, carries the Tanger brand name. SKT's outlets are typically 
located at least 10 miles from major department stores and full-price retail stores. Many are also located 
near tourist destinations or close proximity to interstate highways to provide visibility.
As the only publicly traded outlet mall REIT, Tanger enjoys a unique franchise within the retail REIT space. Its 
closest peers are likely regional malls, although some of the general mall REITs also have a presence in the 
outlet mall space. However, many of the general mall REITs are experiencing pressures from the challenges 
many department stores are facing, and SKT as vulnerable as well.




🚀🚀🚀🚀

Faced with struggling retail tenants in 2018, SKT has chosen to offer short-term (1 
year) leases to tenants at drastically lower rates (approximately 20%-25% according to calculations from 
additional disclosures). SKT is attempting to avoid the blight of vacant stores at its centers and keep 
occupancy above 95%, with the goal of turning these short-term leases back to long-term leases once the 
retailer turmoil is over. The strategy may be the best option among a number of poor ones, 
but are concerned that the lower rent deals will spread to other tenants. The 
current environment can be viewed as typical of a ""normal"" retail downturn which usually coincides with a recession. 
Instead, consumer spending and confidence is high, leading to a dramatic secular shift among 
retailers, especially apparel, as consumers spending habits and tastes change. SKT's entire 
exposure to apparel tenants is therefore concerning.




🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Annual tenant sales per square foot (a measure of portfolio productivity) peaked at 
nearly $400 in 2015, declined to $383 in Q2 2018 due to the ongoing retail turmoil, and has since recovered 
modestly to $391 as of Q1 2019. As detailed above, SKT has committed to keeping occupancy above 95%, 
which it continues to do and has done since 1993. However, the occupancy could dip below 95% for 
2019 as the retail environment continues to degrade. This has come at the expense of lower rents and same 
center net operating income that is now contracting at -0.5% as of Q1 2019. Overall cash blended rental 
rates also turned negative to -0.8% as of Q2 2018, down from mid-teen levels in 2011-2015, but has 
improved slightly to 0.6% growth as of Q1 2019. SKT's balance sheet becoming stressed as cash flow and EBITDA declines. Debt-to-EBITD has crept 
up slightly to 6.1x, near shopping center peer averages and lower than shopping mall peers. However, this ratio could rise as vacancies rise and/or short-term leases with lower rents are increasingly used. 
SKT currently carries a BBB and Baa1 rating from S&amp;P and Moody's, respectively. While S&amp;P gives SKT a 
stable outlook Moody's revised its outlook to ""Negative"" as of March 12, 2019.
