There IS a time limit, here. This can last months; understand that. But, we have a lot of potential catalysts. Earnings on the 23rd, potential news on Cohen as CEO, announcements for pivoting to digital markets, etc. DFV was never even interested in the squeeze (though the squeeze can and likely will happen, in my opinion. Just not for a while); he was interested in the company's potential to grow. Buy the dips, hold steady, REMOVE YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES and for the love of God stop buying 800c OTM bullshit. You may as well write Melvin a check every time you do. Buy as close ITM or simply stocks as you can make them hedge this shit.

22,m5tt50," That's right I said it. If you apes don't evolve we're all fucked.

You're all high on dopamine if you don't think we suffered a major loss on Friday. Massive amounts of open interest was obliterated because we couldn't cross the 300 line. It hasn't come back either, grow some brain cells and google the open interest for 3/19 for your own damn self. It's not even half of what was there last Friday.

We're playing a high stakes game against some of the richest motherfuckers on this planet. If you think all you have to do at this point is hold what you have we are absolutely and totally fucked.

The hedge funds are the loggers and the open interest is the Amazon fucking forest. Guess what? It's on fucking fire. You need to plant some fucking trees by buying as close to ITM calls as you can, and water those bitches with shares, or there's going to be nothing left.

You want to fight the big boys? Well the big boys have everything on the line when it comes to GME, so they aren't going to hold back. You have rent to pay, so we all understand why you don't go all in, but how can we win if we won't? There's one thing the hedge funds don't have that we do, and it just might save our asses, stimmy checks.

So what are you supposed to do with that stimmy? Buy shares? Sure, but there‚Äôs a better option‚Ä¶

If you paid attention to the first GME run-up you‚Äôd notice that we were putting all open options ITM each and every day. That meant that we were gamma squeezing every day. We were a rolling boulder with no end in sight, until RH fucked us all. Guess what? This time we haven‚Äôt done that 1 single day yet. Do you know why? It‚Äôs because you greedy ass smooth brained apes keep wasting money on $800 calls. How the fuck are we supposed to gamma squeeze into $800 when there is a graveyard of open interest from 400-700? The answer is we won‚Äôt.

The hedges have us pinned so well because they know if we unlatch $300 we will unlatch $350 and $400 thanks to open interest. Unfortunately it stops there, but it doesn‚Äôt have to, and DON‚ÄôT worry about that until we get there! We have to blow-up the $300 wall to save GME from death and we have to do it soon.

So how do we break down $300? There‚Äôs really only two things we can do and stimulus will greatly help us. 1st, hold what shares you do have. If you‚Äôre all in, you‚Äôre all in you just have to keep it up.

2nd this is the most important, buy the closest to ITM or even ITM call options that you can as these have much more effect on the price/share of GME than shares do. Sub $450 is great, but we really need $250-$325 to get this thing rolling again. If you‚Äôre a whale looking to join the GME hypetrain this is how you do it.

3rd whatever you can spare use to buy on the large dips. Don‚Äôt wait them out. The quicker we buy a dip back the more the hedges have to pay to reload their shorts.

What will happen? You will see the hedges pull every trick out of the bag to slow the momentum. The 290‚Äôs will take some time, but the strategy will work provided the capital is there. If we can bring 800 ITM then we are going to continue the trajectory set forth by the original GME surge.

Stay strong apes.
