I‚Äôm seeing a lot of wildlife donations and I‚Äôm pissing my pants with excitement as a conservation biologist. 

To everyone donating and sponsoring animals you have no idea how much you‚Äôre helping. Typically, countries that contain high levels of endangered apes are lower on the GDP scale and have very little funding so the influx of even a tiny bit of cold hard cash to these foundations is going to have a positive cascading effect on the local ecosystem. I‚Äôm not sure how many fellow conservationists there on WSB/GME but I‚Äôd like to thank you personally for the positive impacts you have/will make. 

I thought I would throw my two cents in and suggest some highly effective NGO‚Äôs that do miracles. My passion is African wildlife so all the NGOs listed will have major projects within African countries and yes most have projects that protect apes. I am in no way connected to any of these organisations I just know the work they do is important.

These guys a popular choice to choose when sponsoring endangered apes directly on here. Funding goes directly to anti-poaching/research/education and local communities (highly important). Their C.E.O has already thanked WSB personally:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a\_message\_to\_wsb\_from\_the\_director\_of\_the\_dian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)

This is personal: Earlier this year 6 gorilla rangers were shot and killed here on January 12th  in an ambush. There are poor countries in Africa, then there‚Äôs the Congo ‚Äì it receives very little help and small donations would be a huge fucking help. You can choose to adopt a fellow ape and the money would go towards helping the entire park protect our brothers and sisters.

These guys are kings in what they do and probably the most important on this list. They're taking long term control of natural areas across the continent and provide protection and management to over 40,000 square miles (roughly the size of Germany). Their work involves all aspects of park management, from research projects to anti-poaching. Africa parks will be responsible for preserving green spaces in Africa for years to come.

If you guys are lucky enough to go and see wild predators in Africa in 20 years it‚Äôll be largely due to the work these guys do. This South Africa NGO uses applied research to maintain predator and bird of prey species populations within and around protected areas. Projects are primarily in South Africa but are expanding to other African countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. Personally working for these guys would be my dream job.

I‚Äôve seen a couple of elephants been sponsored in the name of GameStop and would love to nominate this NGO as a candidate for anyone willing. Primarily these guys operate within Botswana (the country with the highest population of elephants in the world and also known for its  üíé's). The African elephant population is bearish, to say the least ‚Äì these guys are doing great things to try and bring it back up.

This is the only wildlife sanctuary that I know of that I would put on the list. Naankuse started by saves predators (mainly cheetahs) that have been captured by farmers that would otherwise shoot them for eating their livestock. Now they‚Äôve grown into a huge ecotourism organisation that I would recommend volunteering with if you want to get up close with African wildlife.

If these questions have already been answered somewhere I apologize but maybe some of you apes could help me out.

2. If it does take a couple of days to get that high, what can we expect to see from hedgies, robinhood, etc. to get us to sell before that high point day of the squeeze?

There are very favorable tax rules for donors who want to donate long-term stock (stock they have owned for more than one year) that has appreciated in value. Basically, the donor never has to pay capital gains on the appreciated stock. This can be a tremendous tax benefit and great incentive for donors to give stock to nonprofits.

Here‚Äôs How It Works‚Ä¶

If someone owns stock for more than one year that has gone up in value, that person can donate the stock to a nonprofit, get a deduction equal to the fair market value of the stock at the time of the transfer (its increased value), and never pay capital gains tax on the appreciated value of the stock. The nonprofit will never owe that capital gains tax either. It can take the stock and either sell it right away and not pay any tax, or it can hold on to it‚Äîbut it will never owe capital gains tax on the appreciated value the donor realized.",Donate stock for tax relief.

Quick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE
This made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH
Lordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.

First off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.

This hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess

1) there is no demand.
Claiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.

3) the truck doesn't work
There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.

5) preorders are fake
No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be ""pre-ordered"" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.

This report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.

The bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday

1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.

2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity

3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.

4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.

5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together

Finally

6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.

Thanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.

IF this moons it will be because of this week, THIS FUCKING WEEK and no other and I mean MOOOON (forget January) and Daddy big bollocks knows this.... Hence diverting our limited attention span to pictures of apes and changing the narrative from chasing tendies to 'charity'.

There was an immense volume of FUD on close of Friday, more so than when GME was at $40 that has not been addressed.  Its clear, if we need anything right now its some deep DD for the diamond hands but not this.  Once we are on the moon, then and ONLY then should we be posting adoption animal pics and charity stories.

Now there is a massive, beautiful trend happening within WSB. Adopting and funding these animals, using the money we helped each other achieve to help others do great things is just simple put, beautiful.

82,m4vv5g,"I‚Äôm long on GME and enjoying this crazy ride with all of you fellow ü¶ç. Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I‚Äôm proud of you üíé hands that held through Wednesday. 

I believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. 

In reviewing all the DD, I‚Äôm really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. 

1. I‚Äôve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.

2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who‚Äôs teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn‚Äôt Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).

Again, I‚Äôm long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!

See y‚Äôall on the moon! I‚Äôll be the guy in the mullet handing out wife beaters.
