7,lx8alj,"hello there, this is a updated OCUGEN stock analysis. 

*DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE*

Firstly i want to talk about the recent spike in OCUGEN stock price, this was due to a tweet by OCUGEN saying positive thing about there covid-19 partners and the cure itself. This was followed buy HUGE spike in stock price and great VOLUME for the stock. The trading day ended with OCUGEN up 9% and it's currently up 4% pre-market/after-hours.

Ok, lets get to the real potential behind OCUGEN stock in 3 scenarios.

1. The company and there partners successfully develop a viable COVID-19 cure. I can see OCUGEN stock price going $27+ if this is the case.

2. The company does not find success in developing the COVID-19 cure. If this was the case the stock might fall down to $4 a share.

3. If the company develops the COVID-19 cure and make it commercial. If this is the case i can see the stock go up $38.50 give or take some.


Fundamentals, OCUGEN as a company does not have great fundamentals, for example the revenue is almost non-existent and only a decent DTAR ( debt to asset ratio ) of no more than 40%. ""So why us this stock so great"" you ask, let me tell you about a little something called BIOPHARMA AND BIO-FUCKING-TECHNOLGY. lets talk about Biopharam, so biopharma or BP is a a biological macromolecule or cellular component, such as a blood product, used as a pharmaceutical. Now this sector is growing at a very fast rate, and this will be the biggest sector in 2026 by far. And  Biotechnology is a broad area of biology, involving the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products. ... The term biotechnology was first used by Karl Ereky in 1919, meaning the production of products from raw materials with the aid of living organisms. Yes i copied this from Google. 


ANYWAY, my price target for ocugen in on friday is $16.50

25,lx8dt5,"I am curious to know if I am in the minority or majority on some thoughts I have on the ongoing saga of GME vs. everything else. I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**

First full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:

1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.
2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.

* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more ""normal"" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.

3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.

* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.

TL;DR **my opinion**

1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)
2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD &gt; ""insert ticker"" DD
3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME
4. There is no #4, this was a test

And that's my two cents.",One apes thoughts on everything going down,0.24,1614817493,Rebelsquadro

* 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.
* UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop.
* Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.
* Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months.
* Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn’t allow the stock to drop so low again.

 This is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don’t think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don’t see these concerns as significant right now.
