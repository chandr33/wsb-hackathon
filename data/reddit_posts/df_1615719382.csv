To cover, the shorts have to buy back 140% of the 240% leaving 100%.

If we are that 100% then we are the bag holders.

To avoid us being the 100% bag holders, we must own over 100% and sell our shares bit by bit at different prices. If we all choose a single price to sell all our shares, then whoever chooses the lowest prices will sell their shares and whoever chooses the highest prices will be left holding the bag.

That means a minority of us will win by selling too low and the majority of us will end up holding the bag.

It's all too easy for outsiders and the media to misunderstand this place and talk shit about all of us to feed their rhetoric and I think being able to show something as powerful as the level of donations this sub has provided would be really beneficial. So I'm proposing some sort of charity tracker for the sub whereby if you want to, you can prove your donation and it gets put into a tracker.

Not only would this be great ammo against the media disinformation about the sub and the degenerates in it but it might also encourage others to donate some of their tendies to those in need if they want to. There could even be annual charity drive goals if it became something popular.

I'm happy to make it happen if people want to DM me their charity receipts but if the mods want to take the idea and run with it themselves that would also be great!

They sold a call, so when the stock goes up, they lose money on the call.

They buy just enough stock so that they make exactly as much from the stock as they lose on the call.

So they neither make, nor lose anything.

If delta is .5, then for every $1 the stock goes up, the call goes up 50 cents per share. To break even then, the market maker needs to own 50 shares for every call contract.

If 50 shares go up $1 each, then the market maker makes $50 on the stock, and because delta is .5, they lose $50 on the call contract.

When delta changes to 0.6, the market maker needs to buy 10 more shares so they own 60 shares so they make $60 on the stock when they lose $60 on the contract.
