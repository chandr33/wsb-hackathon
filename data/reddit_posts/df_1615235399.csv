I put a stop order in for $170 on RH for my 6 shares of GME when GME was at $175. The stop order executed 2 hours later for $168.98. As far as I can tell GME never hit $170 in order to trigger the stop order. Why did my order execute? Am I missing something??

Please let me know if Im not understanding how stop orders work or if I'm being forked by RH...

I'm wondering how concerned I should be about sleeping through something monumental. I understand that the collective thought is that any squeezes ""will take a while"" to happen, but my FOST (fear of sleeping through) is real. I plan on hodling for life changing money. 

What would you do if you were a night shift gem pawed primate? Just sleep the normal five hours, wake up every five minutes and check, or just trust the wife's boyfriend to monitor my stonks?

I made a post a couple months back when cathie wood blatantly slandered $uber in favor of tesla's bullshit ride sharing business model.

Let me explain why tesla ride sharing business is bullshit &amp; hypocritical. Firstly it will cause unneeded traffic due to the wealthy purchasing hundred and hundreds of robo taxis on the road. Which leads to my second point it will increase production which is bad for the environment. Thirdly since demand is increased it will unreasonably increase the demand for material which are abundant like lithium. The price will be artificially hiked up so high even though we know it's abundant because most are ignorant and they will exploit if they can. Lastly Ubers business model will entice other automotive companies to do the same, which will create 30x the traffic due to Tesla's business model.

Tesla has been hypocritical any many stands they've taken. Personally I think elon is kind of a villain pushing for fad so early resulting in many casualties when he could have just let tesla fail and start a new companu. Companies can always be made, by lives he risked for his own gains when other companies were already working on self driving especially in China, japan, &amp; the rest of the east. It would have come to fruition with or without him,,l but he chose to put peoples lives on the line. Personally I can't respect it.

On top of that cathie wood the ceo of ark invest attempted to slander Uber on an occasion. They view Uber as a threat to their reign. 

To put it short and simple they don't like the gig economy. The gig economy is too much of a threat to their tyranny &amp; they don't like it. They don't like it at all.

92,m0pnrl,"With a lot of us apes recently coming into money, it is extremely important that we secure and protect our RH or other online brokerage accounts. I am no expert in cybersecurity but I can ""Google"" well. Here are at least a few things you should consider doing **right now**:

1. Change your online brokerage password to something easy to remember but difficult to crack. Remember to mix up the characters in your password, like ! for I and 3 for an E for example. Or you can use Google Chrome's suggested passwords. But remember those passwords will be leaked if your Google account is hacked. So ensure you change your Google password as well. Look here for more information --&gt; [https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/)
2. Enable Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) not only for your online brokerage account but also for the email account that is connected to your brokerage account. Remember, a hacker who has access to your email account can easily reset your online brokerage password. You can opt for receiving a text for your one-time authentication code or use an app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. Here is a link for a blog post by RH --&gt; [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/best-practices/)
3. Beware of phishing scams. Do not click on any link sent to your email. If you get an email asking you to input your username and password to ""verify it"", it is most likely a phishing attempt by someone trying to obtain your password. 
4. Never login to your email account or online brokerage account from a public computer or even from a family or friends computer. You never know if their computers are compromised. 
5. Always update the antivirus and firewalls on your computers to the latest version. I check my antivirus and Windows firewall for available updates every Sunday. 
6. Never answer emails asking for your detailed information that could be used to steal your identity. Never provide your full SSN number on the phone or in e-mails or input it in online forms. 
7. **MOST IMPORTANTLY -** protect your phone since it will have RH or other online brokerage app running and logged in. Change your login pin/password and remove alternate fingerprint or face ID logins of pets/husbands/wives/boyfriends/girlfriends/neighbor, etc. If your phone is lost or stolen, immediately wipe all data remotely and block your number.
