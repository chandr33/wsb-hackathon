This effectively creates the world's largest single-country market for marijuana by population.  I expect a lot of American and Canadian companies will be chomping at the bit to get a piece of the action. Does anyone have any DD on stocks of companies that might be well poised to enter the Mexican market? I know that Khiron Life Sciences has former president Vicente Fox as a board member, so they likely have an insider advantage.

**I know today for some of us was still a +7% day, and for others, it was an ""uh oh I am freaking out"" kinda day.** So I have been looking in the Mega-Thread and I stumbled upon a comment about a GME analysis! **I watched a few of this guy's videos and I have to say I am impressed. He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**

**It won't let me link the vid, Idk why but lookup:**

 GME Stock - FUNDS ENTERING - BULLISH OUTPERFORMANCE - GameStop Prediction for Tomorrow, March 11th 

Rember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.

1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.
2. **We are still up $10\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!
3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!
4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???

TL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.

39,m2gbqy,"Hey everyone! Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories &amp; perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense.

- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.
- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real ""smoking gun"". Some of the evidence has been:
 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.
 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dil9/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort/gqin9qf/)
 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.
- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: This theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.

Anyhow, this is looking at the recent price actions of GME over 15min intervals:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Price over the last few trading days](https://preview.redd.it/mc6wnxv9cbm61.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb313d2a55219d01e8aac130b0b5995e62eb0ece)

&amp;#x200B;

[ Volume over the same period, gaps are after hours or premarket volumes.](https://preview.redd.it/s4p9a0dbcbm61.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a211acc4464b5c4ff831aa767e924041d78f1ba)

 Between the price and the volume, there's not too much that pops out to me, although it's interesting to see we had almost equal volume at the first half way down the dip as we did coming back up. 

[ Shorts available from iBorrowDesk: https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/gme ](https://preview.redd.it/470bnyzdcbm61.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ddb0b02a7d72a720a771a6152bd7a4b1f64db7)

 

What's interesting to see with the available shorts there's something interesting going on:

Quick note, Ex Ar Tee has GME in their ETF baskets, so it's been used as a proxy to short GME. If you short a single share of said ETF, this equivalent to shorting a partial share of GME, so it's not as effective.

So here's the picturing I'm seeing:

3/4: life is good (short borrow rates for ETF = 3.1%, GME = 1.9%)

3/5: life is good, but let's back off our shorts a little bit for some ammo next week. Short positions for GME &amp; XRT slightly decrease for Monday's assault (short borrow rates for ETF = 3.1%, GME = 1.7%)

3/8: We've seen worse, but let's get ahead of this before we get into trouble. We'll use half the GME shorts so we can kill momentum (short borrow rates for ETF = 3.1%, GME = 1.7%)

3/9: Oh shit, we're in damage control mode &amp; shorts at $200+ probably took big L's. To supplement the GME shorts, a large number of ETF shorts could have been placed. This would also leave some GME ammo for tomorrow (short borrow rates for ETF = 3.1%, GME = 1.7 - 2.6%)

3/9: Today looked interesting to me. First off, GME short swooped back in at $270-ish? But the XRT positions from yesterday seemed to have been squeezed out over night. I'm expecting new shorts on XRT for tomorrow. (short borrow rates for ETF = 3.1%, GME = 1.1 - 2.4%)

**If we look at the available short shares and price movements, the big nosedive we took today was likely a paper hand institution taking money off the table or transferring shares from one big player to another.** I would have expected to see people going ham on ETF and GME shorts around the dip, but this really didn't happen. Also, take a moment think about how you would exit a position with 10,000 shares without causing a massive selloff. You have to drive prices up, so that the buy side of the order book fills up enough buyers so you can full exit your position at your target price.  Once you start selling, it would burn through a bunch of buy orders and the price would tank, but you'd hit your average selling price. Since we didn't crater, there was clearly enough big guys on the opposite side that we still ended green.

However there's great news! First, **WE STILL HERE**. Second, these new shorts will be easy to pop at the 270 - 300 level. Third, a new whale with diamond hands stepped in. Fourth, the sell off caused a 50% a whale caused the price 50%, which means the **FLOAT IS GETTING BONE DRY. Buckle my dudes &amp; dudets, end game is close!**

Wait 'til I get my money right (Oh, oh, oh)  

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven  
  
When I awoke I spent that on that game-place (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
I told $473 bagholders I'd be back in a second   
 
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless (Wee, do, wee, wee, do, day)  

To whom much is shorted much is tested  

Get invested guess until he get the message  

DFV feel the pressure, under more scrutiny  
  
And what I do? Act more stupidly  

Bought more GME, more AMC  

My broker couldn't get through to me  

The Media, people suing DFV  

Vlad on TV talkin' like it was just risk and  
  
protection (Waa, do, wee, waaa, doo, wee, do, day)  
  
I'm just saying how I feel, man  

I ain't one of the Plotkins, I ain't go too short, man  
  
I guess the losses should have changed him  
  
I guess he should have forgot where we come from  
  
La la la la  
  
Wait 'til I get my money right  
  
La la la la  

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?  
  
Excuse me? Was you saying something?  
  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing  
  
Ha, ha, you can't tell me nothing  
  
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (Oh, oh, oh)  

Let up the circuit breakers   
  
This is my life homey, you decide yours  
  
I know that DFV held for us  
  
But I couldn't tell you who the disciples was  
  
So I double down until that motherfucker mooning  
  
Old folks talking 'bout holding the bag  
  
But retards these are my hands, the squeeze started two months ago  
  
Oh, are you late?  

No, the squeeze is calculated  
   
And you can hold through anything if u/OmnissiahDisciple227 made it  
  
They say I talk with so much negligence  
  
Ooh, they so sensitive  
  
Don't ever sell your shares early like Scion     
   
And then say dumbshit where you gonna end up apologin'  
  
Let me know if it's a problem man  
  
'Aight man, holla then  

La la la la

Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing  
  
Ha, ha, you can't tell me nothing  

Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (Oh, oh, oh)  

Let the champagne splash  
  
Let that man get cash  

Let that man get passed  

Rocket don't even stop to get gas  

If GME can moon through the rumors  
  
GME can drive off of fumes 'cause  
  
How GME move in a room full of bears?  

How he stay faithful in a room full of paperhands?  
  
Must be the Diamonds, he in tune with his hands    
  
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold  
  
Treasure, what's your pleasure?  

Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her  
  
So if the shorts wear Prada, Adam, DFV wear Nada  
  
WSB in between but way more fresher  
  
With way less effort  
  
'Cause when you sell short is when you lose hard   
  
Y'all homies lookin' like, why Gabe Plotkin?  
  
When they reminisce over you, my God
