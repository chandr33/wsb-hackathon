20,m270ki,"First of all I have to admit I have no idea what I’m talking about. I don’t know how to analyze the market compared to some other genius apes here. But I have an theory on how todays drop was possible.

Hedgies were also buying shares over the past 2 weeks while. After opening new short positions they bought shares at the slightly lowered price. This could be the reason why GME always recovered very quickly. On top of that retail investors keep buying. This could be the reason for GMEs huge increase in price over the last 2 weeks. 

Today was the day where with combined effort hediges tried to create panic selling. The sold a huge amount of shares and simultaneously opened a lot of new short positions. This plus people selling in panic was the reason for today’s drop. Diamond hands and Hedgies on our side saved us from gme dropping even more.

After today you shouldn’t be scared. You can be more confident than ever before. Their biggest effort didn’t do much. GME is still up today and now on SSR for the rest of the week. Today’s a win.",My theory on how today’s drop was possible.,1.0,1615406646,Cifer_21

I think of inflation as sort of a brain flu. The general belief in inflation leads to inflation - people spend money faster because they fear their money will be worth less, but in doing so they increase the velocity of money which is one of the key measures in calculating inflation (the other being the money supply which is being poured onto the economy in the way that my kids like to pour maple syrup on their pancakes).

GOLD, PHYS, LQD, GDX, PSLV and other metal based securities have a steady uptick of 0.5-1% per day in the last week, but are for the most part at near 3 month lows. Perhaps they are on the way to do a breakout?   


They all appear to be volume wise heavily shorted: [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) and are roughly a standard deviation away from their mode in the negative along a 180 day time frame.

\----

If I were a hedgie 🤮,

I would have the following in mind regarding what retail is paying attention to:

* Short utilization is at 100%
* Borrow rate is up around 14%
* Price is going up
* SSR might be triggered making it harder to drive the price down from shorting
* The 2020 Q4 earnings report comes out today at 8 p.m. eastern time.

What do I need to do to scare them?

* drop utilization rate
* drop borrow rate
* drop the price
* trigger SSR and still drop the price to imply that it's legit selling and not more shorting
* make it seem like people are dumping because of the earnings report. Make the earnings and company performance and outlook the scapegoat.

How do I do it?

* accumulate shares slowly to try and not make the price go up too much
* return some of the shares I shorted with some of the ones I just bought so that utilization rate and borrow rate go down
* flood the market with supply to drive the price down
* stop before SSR and let the price recover a little bit
* short the shares I just returned to drive the price down. Might need to sell some of the shares I recently bought too, but ideally, I can just short and save those for the next step.
* Trigger SSR, so now retail thinks shorts can't drive the price down that much
* Flood the market with more shares from the ammo of shares I recently bought and keep shorting to create sell walls to stop price in its tracks.
* Do so strategically to make it look like a ""normal"" panic sell.

What a shame that big money can do shit like this and hide market manipulation under the disguise of normal trading.

You know what my dad told me to do when I started bragging about the stock increase? He told me:  


""Set your stop loss so you don't incur any losses on your gains and you can get out fat instead of being slaughtered."" What a typical *boomer* thing to say.  


You know what I learned, though? Boomers have no experience with meme stonks, and it is clear that a lot of people followed boomer advice today.  


I realized my mistake and bought back in at the dip, but this time, I **promise you** I'm never touching that stop loss button ever again. If I had set a stop loss at my cost basis per share, it would have *never* triggered. I knew what I was getting into. I knew I was just throwing money into a good cause and I got played by the boomers.  


To make right on my mistake, I bought more stock today and I did not set a stop loss limit.
