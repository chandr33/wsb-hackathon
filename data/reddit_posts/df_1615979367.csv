10,m6y3mx,My theory of the hedge fund plan with GME is as follows. They did not cover their short positions entirely.

The FINRA GME SHORT INTEREST report has been issued on MAR-9-2021. The settlement date of the report is FEB-26-2021 and does not include the short selling volume to date of FEB-26-2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny37epynpkn61.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1f8db19dffcc1a7c495f4c5c3252f675eadfa8b

Here we can use the mathematical calculation to calculate the SI of GME.

The FINRA SI of GME is 52.04% by the end of FEB-26-2021.(THIS DATA IS REPORTED BY THE HFs THEMSELVES, THEY WILL SURELY CHEAT AND WILL ONLY BE FINED FOR THAT)

1. The FINRA report is as follows:
2. [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0)

The FINRA report is updated every semimonthly, and the updated data are summarized by FINRA and published in the following 8-9 days.

[http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

2. Here comes the calculation

The latest FINRA report shows that the top 10 institutions hold 140.70 M, TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP accounting for about 201.73% of the total equity of GME. (LOOK!!! THERE ARE MORE THAN 10 INSTITUTIONS!!! EVEN MAYBE 100 OR 1000)

The GME held by the top 10 funds is about 23.35M, TOTAL FUND HOLDING accounting for 33.48% of the total equity of GME. (AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)

&amp;#x200B;

As suggested by [desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/), RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.

The total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)

140.70 M + (23.35M-9M) = 155.05 M

GME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;

GME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;

Q: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?

Synthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.

The total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:

155.05M – 70 M = 85.05 M

The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:

Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float share \* 100%

Bring in data:

Float Short Interest = 85.05 M / 47M \* 100% = 180.96%

This means that at least 1.8 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO POINT OUT ANY MISTAKES THAT I MADE, I AM WILLING TO MAKE ANY EDIT.

EDIT 1: ([desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/))

RC Ventures is Ryan Cohen, new board member and is an insider. Shouldn’t be counted as institution. Possible double count, as the other board members don’t own that much. Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.

EDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https://www.reddit.com/user/dontkillchris/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating. The other stocks like AM-C don't have such problems.

EDIT 3: I found I can't reply to all of your comments, so I can only edit my post here. Is it because my account is quite new and has certain restriction?

EDIT 4:([bakebakingbaked](https://www.reddit.com/user/bakebakingbaked/)) But also doesn’t take ETFs into consideration-------Yes, maybe not included, so I say it's at least 180% !

EDIT 5:([AlexCormier1144](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexCormier1144/))Hey Zach. Thanks for the DD. Where did you get the 40 M from? How accurate is that number? Depending how accurate it is it could swing the SI by a good margin. Cheers!--------The 40M data is what I got by chance here in Reddit, look at the figure that shows the reddit website, but I lost track of the original post.

EDIT 6: I am in ASIA now, so due to the time difference I will not be able to reply you in time. My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!

EDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as ""shorting"".

EDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomadic8893/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!

EDIT 9：My account has been ban for commenting (Weired)! Will create another new account TMR!

EDIT10：Position figure removed.

EDIT11: IN ORDER TO DELETE THE REPEATED COUNTED SHARES, I WILL ONLY USE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDS DATA FOR CALCULATION. AGAIN, THIS ONLY PROVIDES A THOUGHT FOR CALCULATION, THE FINAL SI IS SO DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT12: I CAN'T CHANGE THE TITLE, IF POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT AS ""180% SHORT VOLUME"" WHICH IS STILL GOD DAMMED HIGH!!!

1. FINRA is the source where I got the data. As for me, FINRA is the only source I can trust partially. It works together with SEC to govern the US trade market fairly.
2. I will trace back to the SI data from the middle of January, and make the calculation to prove my conclusion: The true SI of GME is definitely higher than **337.22%**!

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 0x3m2ub4qkn61...*

This is the screenshot of GME SI from FINRA when I first do GME DDs. Look at the date: 02/02/2021, and look at the SI: 226.42% !

3. [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

Through this website, we can know the settlement date of the FINRA report:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xc24loz5qkn61.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69712bb8f66beefa9ba65b4028a875c3d3dff7a5

The settlement date of this ""226.42%"" FINRA report should be 1/15/2021.

4. I take the trade figure from the FINRA website to monitor the price change as well as the trade volume. Here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img s69bs128qkn61...*

5. So the upper half represents the GME stock price, and the lower part represents the corresponding trade volume. From the late January to Feb 1, the price increase didn't show up with the volume increase! Hence, this was merely little gamma squeeze, definitely NOT SHORT SQUEEZE and NOT SHORT POSITIONS CLOSING!!!

6. When 'closing short positions' happens, there must be stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase!!! KEEP IN MIND THIS! VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!! According to this concept, the middle January can be a tiny closing of short positions.

7. Look at the trade volume from Feb 22 to Mar 16, do we see any 'stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase'? The answer is NO! NO! NO! Even with tiny price increase together with trade volume increase, those trade volume won't provide enough GME stock to completely close their short positions!

For example, one of the 'stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase' can be Feb 2, 2021; Here is the figure, but the trading volume is too low for the HFs to completely close their short positions!

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jtyduk2aqkn61...*

8. Another way to prove that HFs are not closing their short positions:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B7NiaCCHqBLYW-WxOOQXHoDs7LKt2dP3U9GEYKXe-cE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B7NiaCCHqBLYW-WxOOQXHoDs7LKt2dP3U9GEYKXe-cE/edit#gid=0) (collected by [u/RealPayTheToll](https://www.reddit.com/u/RealPayTheToll/))

[http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)

I captured some data from FINRA website to get the daily short volume and their percentage. Here is the summarized data from Jan 15 to Mar 16.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qpf4dlzbqkn61.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14596faa78b6dff6ef2154f45233b03116a42be

*Processing img 643ozozbqkn61...*

Pay attention to the ""% short"",when the percentage is higher than 50%, nevertheless what the exact short positions increase per day, it means the HFs were shorting more and more GME stocks, and by no chance will they cover their short positions these days!

Even when the exact short positions increase per day is only 'one' share, the final short interest will be higher than 226.42%!

This means: If you owed the bank 1000 USD at Jan 15, 2021. And from then on, you keep borrowing 1USD (or whatever higher than 0 USD) from the bank. Hence, by now, you owed the bank more than 1000 USD. THIS IS THE CASE!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now I will show you how to calculate the float short interest rather than the short interest!

GME total shares: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;

GME free float shares: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;

\-----------------------------------

The Short Interest calculation formula is as follows:

Short Interest = Shorts shares / Total shares \* 100

226.42% = Short shares / 70 M

Short shares = 158.494 M

\-----------------------------------

The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:

Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float shares \* 100%

Bring in the data:

Float Short Interest = 158.494 M / 47 M \* 100% = 337.22%

\-----------------------------------

I think the HFs didn't start to short the ETFs as early as Jan 15, 2021. So, the true SI of GME should be much higher than 337.22% by now! This circumstance did take the ETFs shorting into consideration. And by Jan 15, 2021, the HFs didn't realize the danger of retail investors, hence the motivation of them cheating the FINRA is lower than now. This data should be more trustful compared with recent data!

40,m6ye4p,"TLDR: GME's negative beta doesn't mean anything, it's caused by the stock's huge increase from December to January and the way that beta is calculated.

This is a response to [a post claiming that GME's negative beta is evidence that the shorts have not covered](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/). On the face of it, this isn't the stupidest thing that I read today, but it seemed like a reach at best:
&gt; About GME specifically
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the historical beta of GME:
&gt; 
&gt; 02/28/2021 -2.195
&gt; 
&gt; 12/31/2020 1.404
&gt; 
&gt; 09/30/2020 1.084
&gt; 
&gt; 06/30/2020 1.038
&gt; 
&gt; 03/31/2020 0.4512
&gt; 
&gt; You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

&gt;[...]I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

What struck me, however, is that GME's beta supposedly didn't go negative until February. Wasn't GME shorted to shit well before February? Why would beta only plunge in February? The worst part, though, is that the commentary reveals that the writer of the original DD (u/animasoul) didn't look into how beta is calculated. How are you going to start attributing meaning to a number without understanding where it comes from?

So I looked into how beta is calculated, and sadly GME's negative beta is entirely meaningless, an artifact caused by an outlier. Here's what do you need to know:

1) Beta is easy to calculate. You can do it yourself with Excel following [these steps](https://investexcel.net/how-does-yahoo-finance-calculate-beta/). 

2) The beta reported by Yahoo Finance et al is calculated using only 36 monthly data points. This is not very many, which means the calculation can be skewed by outliers fairly easily.

3) There is a [HUGE OUTLIER in January that wrecks the whole calculation](https://imgur.com/a/JMEaUZ0). This is why the beta suddenly went negative in February. Basically, when looking at monthly pricing, GME went up 1625% from December to January, while the benchmark went down -1%. This completely warps the beta calculation but wasn't caused by any kind of shorting activity, because the offending data point is one where GME's stock price is RISING, while the market is falling. If you remove this outlier, [GME's beta is POSITIVE 1.58](https://imgur.com/a/iYjrBR3). If the market had risen 1% instead of falling 1% that month, [GME's beta would have been 1.06](https://imgur.com/a/SOTHAG3).

Long story short, GME's negative beta isn't a story about whether or not the shorts have covered, it's a story about a stock going to the moon (+1625%) in a month when the rest of the market went down slightly (-1%) and how that single data point warped the 36 month average because the stock's upward movement was so pronounced. The stock's beta will likely remain negative for three years, until the outlier falls out of the 36 month calculation period. While the outlier was caused by the gamma/short squeeze, since then, none of this has anything to do with whether the stock is currently being shorted, or whether the shorts are covering.

Anyone with a spreadsheet and an internet connection could have come to this same conclusion, so do a little research before believing everything you read, even if it's long, supports your preconceptions, and ends with diamond hand emojis.",Why GME's negative beta is meaningless and tells us nothing one way or the other about whether the shorts have covered,1.0,1615980816,Beartholomew

'Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told *Barron’s* on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.

Dusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.

“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky added.'

CarParts PRTS

I wrote a special post yesterday highlighting just a few of the key reasons for PRTS. This post honestly, is catered to the WSB crowd of 9.5 million members. That post pretty much sums this up. This has also been the play before. This company has gone from overall sales in 2019 of 280 million to 2020 443 Million. This company used to lose a lot of money, and have negative cash flows. During the pandemic the company had positive quarters and started to make money. Is this turn around complete? That is the question, however we are still in a pandemic and at least for the next 1-2 quarters people are home and ordering carparts online. On the WSBNew some redditors even commented they also have just started to use the service please check the post on WSBNEW. I believe 3 of them out of maybe 8 comments. The sentiment and PRTS during the pandemic says that the tune may have changed and the business will flourish. However, if you know me, I like to have facts and don’t do if, and hope… so I will say for the next 1-2 quarters they should crush it…. Analysts are predicting about 50% sales growth….last quarter was 100%!!!! 100%%%!!!!???!!! That is insane. Now, I do not work at the company so I cant say of course if it is closer to 50 or closer to 100%. I can only tell you that year over year it has been 70%.....last quarter was 100%.... they have picked up steam… and if it is closer to 100% rather than their 50% this is once again going to be a huge beat!

PRTS is heavily shorted….Anything above 15% is heavily shorted. My guess, and this is my guess is that people saw a stock thatwas $1….. went to $23 and said lets short!!! They did not pay attention. Yes, I did see the stock under $5 and did not buy…because if you know me I rather pay more when the company finally executes and has proven they have grown into the valuation, then speculate and hope it moons. I do not guess, I wait for the company to execute before testing. I started trading this near $10…Many………..Many….Many Times….. I decided at $18 to rich for my blood… and just entered back in $15-16.

PRTS is a 700 million dollar company that has really started to knockout numbers. There are many players in this field far larger, Oreillys, Autozone, Pep boys…. It is a bonus that this is so cheap, shorted and could be a primary target!!!!

Good luck and lets make money.

JPOW has to at some point have an adult daddy-daughter conversation with the market and say

‘I’ve supported your degenerate hedonistic lifestyle that has been without personal repercussions, bailed you out for public intoxication and indecent exposure at the country club, now I need you to slowly stand up on your own two feet. You can’t be a trust fund whore your WHOLE life’

Now IF, unlike us, he and the Fed do in fact have a double-digit IQ or above they can create a win-win by

1) being a fake intraday/intraweek🌈 🐻 and use some cleverly bearish words that makes the market shit itself temporarily THE WEEK WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR STIMMYS so that:

2) It provides a great entry point for overextended/hyperinflated stocks that autists are too cautious about entering at PE ratios longer than the fake number my wife gave me for her ‘weekend trip to Cancun with her friends’ - which means people buy the fucking dip and start propping up the market again like crowdsurfing white girl at a Fleetwood Mac concert.

TL;dr If market shits itself today, it’s not accidental - it’s to provide a great entry point to buy the fucking dip with stimmy $

Being I'm a parent with an Autistic child, I thought I would mention this.  My son is socially awkward, yet has a heart of gold. Watching him grow up has been an amazing journey. Every autistic child is different from the rest, no two are alike. As he progressed through school I was surprised to see he had a special talent for math and science. We decided when he was young that we would school him through Connections Academy (online school). Why? because we know that other people (kids) can be mean. We didn't want to subject him to that. He has flourished! He isn't ""slow"" or retarded, he just sees the world in a different way than you and me. If you ever run into him on XBox..... you wouldn't know he's autistic. He will more than likely piss you off as he beats you over and over. Yes, he has a knack for video games as well. Every day he comes down to my computer and tells me some new information about this game and that. Spends a lot of time researching all the gaming news. So, in short I just wanted to share this with you all. I'm proud of my son, I love my son.

The DD-PDF can be found **here**: https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf



I think /u/rensole described the PDF well: 

""The DD is in the form of a PDF consisting of 31 easy to read slides.

it shows that the FTD's are in a cyclical nature, how much float is left in total (about 19.3 Million shares). it go's into the risk model it go's into everything.


The HFs banked on the bankruptcy jackpot this means that they bet on the fact that gamestop would go under, destroying the spring and giving them all the tendies, but because Ryan Cohen stepped in this became impossible, also with the digital transition and the positive public sentiment this one is now off the table.

so check the pdf because this stuff is rainman levels of detailed.

to me this shows me that the FTD's are more cyclical in nature, meaning they use Short A to short normally, then they can't find a good share to cover this so what do they do? right they Short again (creating short B), so they use short B to cover the debt of short A, then they short again (creating short C) and they cover short B.... you guys seeing a pattern here?""",Insane DD on why the GME-squeeze inevitable and how the HFs dug their own graves by banking on a bankruptcy jackpot,1.0,1615982506,SteveCookMarryMe
