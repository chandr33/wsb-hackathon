Now $GME has a new dip to go with their tendies. so i bought that too, and let me tell you....... BBQ dip with your tendies is by far the best meal ive ever had.

5,m2531g,"WOW, they really did that??? Unfortunately they were able to sell enough of their shares to trigger stop losses for massive amounts of accounts. Me the retarded Ape that I am knew what was happening and tried to buy the dip but my buy orders wouldn't go through because the stock was paused multiple times. One time it was paused on the upswing and it was only an upswing of 6 points!! They are even posting on here right after it happened saying to sell and take your profits!  Great job by the admins to take all those posts down. I was able to recoup some of our ape shares and increase my position. 

Thanks Suits you just delayed the inevitable.",How that dropped happen and why I'm happy to be an APE that holds and buys the DIP,1.0,1615401867,PerceptionWorking661
