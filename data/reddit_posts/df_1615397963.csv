48,m23cw3,"Yes yes, very technical. 

Though I’m thoroughly retarted, it’s pretty obvious there were hedgies fueling today’s pump. Massive buy orders after market yesterday, pre market today, and early morning as well. 

These are 500,000c orders that no regular hype investors would be able to swing. 

Either, one of the GME fore fathers betrayed us, or the hedgies fueled the rebound today.

58,m23d78,"So basically, to start it off, i’ve been with this sub since November, and i gotta admit it is what it looks like, idiots supporting idiots and i love it.

So since January, when GME popped off, i’ve been looking at the company closely, and tbf, it is honestly not a bad, long term investment, also i wanted to buy the dip (in Feb) cause i knew it would pop off again. 
So I was really eager to buy it, there was just one slight problem. My (16) older brother (23) is my source of start money, and he will not let me invest in Gamestop cause he thinks its a pump&amp;dump.
