Wanna know why the market has been red lately? J-Pow is saying fuck your Calls.

"" Asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy, Powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the Fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market, among other conditions.¬†""It‚Äôll take some time to get there,‚Äù he said, noting that inflation is also running well below the Fed‚Äôs 2% target""

**Section 1: ""HyPeR-iNfLaTiOn Is CoMiNg!""**

Let's go back to some basics. Thanks to our current banking system, we live in a debt-based society where our goal is to pull out a loan for 5% interest and make 420.69% gains. Now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie, so now we have a problem. For example, I have 100 tendies and you have 100 bananas and we decide a 1:1 tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good. All of a sudden, fucking Chad McDonkeyKong says he has 200 bananas and he wants to trade with me. So now we have 300 bananas in circulation and only 100 tendies. I now agree that the exchange rate is 1:3 tendies to bananas and now you're down 66% on your banana trade. Fucking Chad...

That's inflation for you. More money is added into circulation, and therefore you need **more** of it to buy the same goods.

Now let's say your girlfriend gets pissed at Chad McDickFace for putting too many bananas in the banana market (why would she? LOL), so he pulls out 100 bananas. Now with 200 bananas in circulation and 100 tendies, the exchange rate is 1:2 tendies to bananas. Guess who just made tendies? Fuck ya you did! Now you're only down 50% from when Chad entered the market.

That's deflation for you. Money is removed from circulation and there you need **less** of it to buy the same goods.

Ya, I know that already, retard! Get to the point!

If we look at the US's monetary base (blue) and the Fed's balance sheet (red) you can clearly see there's a lot more bananas in circulation. INFLATION!!!

Not quite... Economists use CPI (consumer price index) to collect information about pricing on goods, services and loans in the economy. It's got some flaws, but it's been reliable enough to account for inflation for the last few hundreds of years, so we'll stick with this as our metric.

See that majestic Big Black ~~Dick~~ Arrow? We call that steady inflation and the Fed like's this around 2% Year over Year (YoY) for ""optimal market and economic growth and stability"". I recall hearing 2 - 3% is about the average that most growing societies experienced as well, so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate. So what does it mean? In order to stay ahead of all the new Chads pulling out loans and YOLO'ing you need to increase your net worth by **at least** this amount per year. Real returns are when you factor in taxes on assets/gains and this tend to lower it.

Anyhow, let's see what the data says about inflation and QE:

Meh...?

**Section 2: ThIs TiMe Is DiFfErEnT**

Okay, so what the fuck?? We're on 4 rounds of QE and no hyper inflation... I thought the FED was an infinite money glitch? So how does this QE, infinite money pinata work?

First of all, **QE IS A SUM ZERO EXCHANGE.** It's primary objective is to drive interest rates on treasury securities to 0% and thereby decrease interest rates the bank can loan at (home loans, credit card loans, etc...). So how does it work?

It's something like this. Primary dealer (bank?) goes to the bond market, looking for some tendies. Normally they would only buy $10 worth of tendies, but Papa JPow is mother fucking huuuungray, so they buy $60 worth of tendies each time they go shopping. This is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply, but it doesn't (the US will only be issue so much debt), so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit. So over time, we'll start to see a supply shortage (remember, bonds are retarded, so **when the price goes up, interest rates and yields go down.** Fucking magic). JPow is trying to forcing a MOTHER FUCKING SUPPLY SHORTAGE in bond market.

So what's JPow doing with these gay bonds? See, daddy JPow is worried that these little bitch ass banks (JPM, WFC, etc...) are going to go full retard again, like in 2008, so he's shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until we're back to normal. In exchange for the $50 tendies, he's giving these ass hats $50 cash so they can keep jerking each other off, as long as they don't YOLO it into the markets and economy, life is good. Daddy JPow also knows he can keep doing this QE trick until bond prices go to infinity, but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with...

Now, at the same time these smaller banks aren't as retarded as we think they are, and they also don't want to fail like in 2008 and they've learned a thing or two. Sure Papa JPow can throw money at them again, but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time. So, the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy JPow for some easy gains. They also know many of us are fucked without jobs, so why even risk lending right now?

So banks are buying bonds, JPOW has a safe, and banks aren't lending... Nothing new here...

Well, the take away here is that all that money JPow is printing is STUCK in the banks and the banks don't want to lend it out. A good way to show this is the M2 Velocity, which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed. It's like this: Monkey A borrows banana from Chad McShittyAss. Monkey A buys tendies off Monkey B. Monkey B gives banana back to Chad. In this case, the banana went from C -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C. Since Chad created the banana and destroyed the banana, he doesn't count, in the transaction, so it's just A &amp; B that matter. In this case the M2 velocity would be 2.0. Now let's look at how QE affects us:

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=BDgP ](https://preview.redd.it/plzgaux0r5l61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aca546e26a8055786997e2da50e5ba60423d15e3)

We're currently sitting at an abysmal 1.13 in the M2V right now, compared to an average of 1.76 we from the 60's until the 90's. So that means people aren't spending. **We're in a dollar shortage.**

Well, no shit! We can't go anywhere and buy shit!!

Yep and to top it off, banks are still not lending with all that jerk off money they got from Papa JPow. Any time the Blue line is above the black one, it means **banks are tightening lending restrictions.** As you can see, banks are still tightening their lending right now. Smart people are paying off debt right now, but **this destroys money** in the process.

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=qw94 https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/data\/sloos\/sloos-202101-table-1.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/zknji3l3r5l61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0f08126076a77e1b339d4fe294d7ff4fecf9fe)

Okay Jerk-off-osaurus\_Rex, I JUST WANT TENDIES! HOW DO I FIND TENDIES!?

Okay, so if banks aren't lending (disinflationary), people are sitting on cash (disinflationary) and smart people are paying down debt (deflationary), where's the inflation coming from? Actually, it's all speculation.

[https:\/\/hedgopia.com\/cot-peek-into-future-through-futures-how-hedge-funds-are-positioned-196\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/vzs75rq6r5l61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dda87881983a0987e4734f5360affe995c12eb)

See that red line? That's the interest rate on 30y bonds (inverse the price). We want it to go down. See those little green marks, those are short positions, they make it go up. Last year saw the **LARGEST short position in the bond market. EVER**. You know Papa JPow with his infinite money glitch, he wants the red line to go down. Sweet, **we have the FUCKING FEDERAL RESERVE on our side**! You know who hates shorts more than Elon, Cohen or Our RKT Crew? The FUCKING FED. Since the dollar is tied to treasuries, popping the shorts will also cause the **dollar to rally.**

You know who hates the dollar to rally? Fucking everyone. Stock prices drop, Gold prices drop, Oil prices drop, it's harder to trade internationally... Yep... **JPow is a huge fucking bear**. Your calls are actually fukt.

So how do we profit off JPow?

Full gay bear style (when the time is right of course). Macro can be slow as shit to play out, so leaps or shares are the game. Timing is hard for this shit, but JPow is HUUUNGRY for them bondies.

The most obvious monies to be had: long $TLT (30y bonds), Cash is fine too! (just follow $UUP for a rally), Inverse $GDX. I dunno, I'm sure you other gay bears have some fetishes out there that will compliment a dollar rally.

What to stay away from: Inflation protected Bonds (this is tied to the CPI and you'll lose money if our economy eats shit). Probably companies with large negative cash flow when shit hits the fan. You know, the usual recession shit.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.

TLDR: What the fuck did I just read? So much gear bear shit in here dude... What the actual fuck?

a) QE hasn't lead us to hyper inflation, banks still aren't lending and other countries are deflating right now, so **deflation is the real enemy.**

b) JPow is trying to cause **a supply shortage in the bond market (bond prices go upsies)**

c) JPow or the economy are going to pop the shorts on the 30y and cause the markets to melt down.

d) When JPow does ""The Twist"", that's when he'll start buying 30y's :)
