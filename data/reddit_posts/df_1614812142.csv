**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lspbb5/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and/)

---

**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.

---
**Analysis**

Currently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. 

* At each $10 threshold up to $150/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. 
* At $160/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.

&amp;nbsp;

Since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).

&amp;nbsp;

**If price were to squeeze up to $810/share (~56b market cap): 

* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float
* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze
* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)
* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions

&amp;nbsp;

As of 3/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **&gt;$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **&gt;11.5m**

NMRK has fared very well since tech started puking. It may not have retard strength to 10x in a week, but can double and triple in a year, most importantly, it is safe because $800 million of cash it was set to receive over the next several years just got pulled forward to 2021 thanks to NASDAQ. The company is buying back $400 MILLION in stock. Commercial leasing activity is about to get blown the fuck up after Covid when everyone gets the jab. Even if they don't, Q4 2020 EPS was $0.30, so still very good in an okayish commercial real estate market.

I think fair value anywhere between 15 to 30 depending on how bullish you are on commercial real estate activity.

74,lx6wl6,"TLDR: UNFI = 💎👐🚀🌕

I've been watching unfi for about 4 years now.
This post is going to be very basic as the last unfi DD post I read had lots of good information. There's no point in repeating the same arguments.

I have a part-time job at a grocery store for insurance. Over the last four years I've been watching UNFI increase their market share and product offerings while the stock price plummeted. Early on I noticed a large short interest. Currently it's around 22% and has been for quite some time. You have to ask yourself why would there be a large short interest throughout a pandemic for a dine at home stock?

One could certainly argue the mismanaged acquisition of SVU greatly contributed to this, however something that I have not heard mentioned in any due diligence report on UNFI is the lawsuit against Goldman Sachs for the unfair terms of the loan. It was around this period in time that I began to notice how large is the short interest was. It is my guess and opinion because of this lawsuit UNFI is being punished by way of short interest. I have not heard anyone mention this as a potential reason for such a high short interest.

During the last four years I have seen UNFI gobble up a significant amount of brands increasing their distribution to our store from about 10% of our product offering line to well over 50%.  Don't take my word for it you can go into any grocery store and look at the tag on the shelf and it will tell you which distributor the product comes from. If you've been paying attention to this (and who would) you would find a consistent increase in their market share. 

In fact recently they acquired 62 QFC locations in my area. This tells me more than any potential Amazon contract. I, in fact don't care whether or not they get the Amazon go stores because I think those will flop in the longterm. That being said a lot of people are looking at the Amazon contract as a sign of success and it's my opinion that they will retain that contract but I couldn't care less.

Let us know talk cerebrally about their shipping issues.
Recently I saw three drivers unloading a UNFI truck and I jokingly asked them if they were Union drivers having three people control one truck. They responded by saying no they were training new drivers from JB Hunt to deliver their products in my area. This replaces a complicated intricate system of independent owner operators. consolidating their shipping costs into one account as opposed to hundreds of accounts is going to save them a lot of money.

My bottom line is that UNFI continually increases their market share and the synergies will be realized from the SVU acquisition in fairly short order. This is my YOLO play and I'm planning on holding it upwards of $100 a share. My guess is that we could reach over $200 a share within two years. 

As you can see in my previous post I hold 2600 shares.
If I could create a gif for this stock it would be a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back on a skateboard. (Someone posted this exact gif on yahoo finance board and it is so accurate) I feel very comfortable with this stock and although I check it multiple times a day it's not something that I need to do I sleep like a baby at night!

One thing that I will caution y'all about is the earnings reports never send the stock skyrocketing. In fact last earnings report they crushed it and their stock did absolutely nothing over the week after earnings. This is of absolutely no concern to me. When you have a high short interest and low volume trading this sort of thing is to be expected. 

A negative point about this company, (very important to include in an unbiased assessment) is the general silence from the board about what they're doing. However I'm looking at this through the lens of ""they're too busy expanding their business instead of making hyped up press releases"" and this just gives me more confidence in the stock for the mid and long-term.
