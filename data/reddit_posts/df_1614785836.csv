33,lwwsq8,"Vonage is the 2nd largest UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service) player. 3.7B market cap. They compete against Twilio (largest - 60B+ market cap) and Bandwidth (3.9B market cap). They also own a contact center business that competes with Ringcentral and a legacy Voip business 

[IDC UCaas landscape](https://preview.redd.it/nmraoz4r1uk61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2db04ff9e867a25cfeb470bf76bd771aeb3bcb3)

The IDC chart shows that Vonage is a clear leader. Vonage has a significant lead in Video API stuff due to its acquisition of TokBox. It's API business was up 100%+ last quarter. Checkout the last ER transcript - quite a bullish tone for the great business.

UCaaS itself is a great space to be as evidenced by long runway of growth (see TWLO). Legion Partners, an activist has on their case and they have had multiple opportunities to sell at 15+ (since all the back in 2018) but bought more recently. 

Vonage has it's investor day on Friday. They will have an opportunity to close the valuation gap.
