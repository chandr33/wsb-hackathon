40,m37z3w," \*This is not financial advise, I am not a financial advisor.

I like the stock, like many of you.

However, what caught my attention was the large relative drop in trading volume today than we've been used to seeing.  Which is just odd isn't it? 

With everything that we know today with recent news regarding:  
Evolving business strategies, **3 Days** SSR listings, incoming stimulus into the economy...

Why does GME break an 8-day uptrend after evidence continues to suggest that outlooks are improving?

Here are some possible explanations,  


* **EX - ARE - TE** (Retail ETF containing **GME**) is still at **114% Short Interest of Float📉** (remaining shares shorted).

While GME is on the SSR list for the remainder of the week📈,  HF's could potentially be shorting the ETFs which are heavy GME, while simultaneously going long on the other holdings in the ETF to hide the evidence. All of this has been suggested by many users and I tend to agree that its a possibility. So the low volume could just be the SSR list in general prevents the massive short volume we're used to seeing, because low volume means low selling too.

&amp;#x200B;

OTHER potential factor: 

* ""Meme stocks are back!"" ...or is it?

somehow, almost miraculously, nearly all meme stocks go *berserk* today, yet no one was really discussing or has mentioning them from what I could tell. I'd imagine that drew some attention from GME... however, a theory is that it may be a HF trap if HF went heavy long on them to draw in retail volume.

AMC might just be the biggest trap of all, the volume on AMC today was....interestingly high.

Are people really that into pumping AMC? or are Hedge Funds and shills taking advantage of a **known divisive factor** among the sub?

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Meme Wall at $**269**!!!!1"" ...**or is it?**

Us 🦍🦍💎🙌 must realize we are approaching a critical price target that exists just beyond $300... We should all try to remember the ape history of what has occurred in the past once we climbed this summit, it wasn't pretty and that is when things.. started to get weird, I'll just say that. (I'm hungry and want to get this over with)

Obviously, memes are awesome, but memes are not **the end all, be all.** Memes were just the steps to lead us to where we are today.  We cannot be held prisoner to memes, meaning, we must remember to think and act **individually,** ***regardless*** **of the meme potential.** Especially in this unprecedented time.

In my opinion, *there is no meme wall*. No one here is selling significant amounts at $269+, 

but it **is,** however, a very ***convenient and important*** number to keep the price below.

I believe HFs placed key short positions **at** or slightly above $**269,** and every time the price approached that price, it was heavily shorted.  

Trying to make the most out of what they have left.

And I believe this is an attempt to sow more division among the 🦍🦍🦍. Knowing damn well **69** is a sacred number and is somehow a key to the universal question.

So when we're stuck trading sideways just under our sacred number, we may think its our collective meme passion that is limiting us.

You think, ""damn, looks like our people ***are*** selling"", and it may cause some 🧻🙌. 

Seems like a good hedge strategy anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

WRAPPING UP.....

When it comes to comparing GME to any other stock,  there is no other GME. This is literally what everything is about and has been about... all the FUD, all the blatant institutional market manipulation, all the rollercoaster moments of the past 3 months...

64,m383v9," EVI has a relatively high short interest of 17% (not extraordinary). BUT it usually trades a low volume so its short ratio is 27 (which is a lot). For those who are not familiar with the short ratio: at current average volume per day, it would take 27 days to cover all short positions (17% of total float). This means there's 27 times the daily volume waiting to take profits or stop losses in case the stock goes up. Its been a month of profits for those guys, what do you think will happen if a retard stampede pushed the price on this one?

We should all try to remember the ape history of what has occurred in the past once we climbed this summit, it wasn't pretty and that is when things.. started to get weird, I'll just say that. (I'm hungry and want to get this over with)

Obviously, memes are awesome, but memes are not **the end all, be all.** Memes were just the steps to lead us to where we are today. We cannot be held prisoner to memes, meaning, we must remember to think and act **individually,** ***regardless*** **of the meme potential.** Especially in this unprecedented time.

In my opinion, *there is no meme wall*. No one here is selling significant amounts at $269+,

but it **is,** however, a very ***convenient and important*** number to keep the price below.

I believe HFs placed key short positions **at** or slightly above $**269,** and every time the price approached that price, it was heavily shorted. Trying to make the most out of what they have left.

And I believe this is an attempt to sow more division among the 🦍🦍🦍. Knowing damn well **69** is a sacred number and is somehow a key to the universal question.

So when we're stuck trading sideways just under our sacred number, **we may think its our collective meme passion that is limiting us.**

You think, ""damn, looks like our people ***are*** selling"", and it may cause some 🧻🙌.

Seems like a good hedge strategy anyways.

WRAPPING UP.....

When it comes to comparing GME to any other stock, there is no other GME. This is literally what everything is about and has been about... all the FUD, all the blatant institutional market manipulation, all the rollercoaster moments of the past 3 months...

I **know** there is still something massive happening with Gamestop, and I have not seen any piece of fact or evidence to prove otherwise. You can simply say ""confirmation bias"" to this whole thing, but confirmation bias does not apply when the information you've arrived at is probably true given the facts provided. Do any of you remember ""Blue's Clues""? 1 Clue, 2 Clue, 3 Clue! hey what do you know, we turned those clues in to valuable information that we can build on to arrive at a greater understanding.

***Keep building*** ***that collective information***, we are free to either **approve** or **reject** theories based on information that has been provided.

Please do not believe information presented directly to you (a la ""big media"") unless you have some factual basis or collective knowledge that **supports** that.

76,m386su,"I think a million haters will jump out and vote this to death when this see the titles. But I have to say it for the good of the apes. Call me whatever, I work for the hedge fund or even the deep states. 

As we all know, the second surge is driven by the hedge fund/institutional investors especially if you examine the volume. Few hedge funds made millions profit of the apes, 700 million was the highest I saw from the news. I didn’t see anyone retail ape made over 100 million the last time including DFV. Worth to mention a Chinese idiot coin guru who won the lunch auction with Warren Buffett last time lost 8 million in the last right. 

So why I dare to predict on a stock that doesn’t go with logic or fundamentals? 

TLDR:

It’s simple, because there is a very high chance that GameStop will issues a big secondary after earning aka exit the quite period. Just like AMC and Tesla did. Nothing wrong with it, if they didn’t do it, I would have to question the IQ of this managerment team. It’s a once a life time opportunity to pay off all debts and left with billions to make M&amp;A or invest into new opportunities. 

The big boys will definitely bail and dump before they can do that, and they have do it slow and keep up the morale in this subreddit. So next Wednesday is likely the last day of craze of GME.

## MDM Permian: Recent results

In February MDM Permian reported the results of a NuTech Advanced Reservoir Characterization. This shows the extent of the oil reserves existing on its property.

https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/dns/news/document/47532/content 

Reports show that the Lindley A lease, the Clearfork contains over 3.5 million barrels of recoverable oil per 640 acres. While, the San Angelo contains over 5.1 million barrels of recoverable oil per 640 acres.

At $65 per barrel of WTI crude oil, these two reservoirs combined contain in the region of $567.8 million worth of oil.

In addition to this, its 1,680-acre Lindley Ranch contains an estimated 13.5 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. That equates to over $881.7 million at $65 WTI.
