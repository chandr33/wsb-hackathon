31,m0seel,"My fellow degenerates, it has come to my attention that Jim Cramer (Virgin), has advised his legion of boomers to sell Palantir Technologies. I am posting this to present a long term bullish case for Palantir, and why I think this recent sell-off is a great buying opportunity.

First, I am disputing the reliability of Cramer's picks. According to a 2016 study, the S&amp;P 500 outperformed Cramer by 6% over a 15 year period. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13) .  I further contend that most positive performance is due to boomers mindlessly following his advice and thereby contributing to buying pressure, rather than high quality fundamental or technical analysis.

Second, Palantir Technologies' Gotham Software is widely used throughout government sectors, and it's Foundry Software is becoming largely incorporated for commercial purposes. Palantir has experienced 40% YoY revenue growth, with analyst forecasts of a 68% revenue increase in 2021, and unlike many high-flying tech companies, has not relied on large amounts of debt to sustain itself. This limits the downside risk, and even has Morningstar assigning it an undervalued rating. We are not known as value investors on this thread, but when companies that should be trading at 3x their so called ""fair value"" are trading below it, it's a good sign for full degenerates.

Third, Palantir's RSI is drifting closer to oversold territory, with a 25% increase in shares short since January 29th. The MACD is currently drifting away from the signal line, but we should see bounce back/resistance at around the $20-21 mark, as we did last Friday. This will present a good opportunity for the bulls, as Alex ""The Magic"" Karp kicks the bears back up the stream.",BULL! Cramer will get BTFO'd on Palantir,1.0,1615243818,sehr16

I get it, these are exciting times to see GME breaking 200, again... but STOP!! This is POCKET CHANGE! 200, 300, 400, 800... It's a lot to those with shares averaging less than $30 each, yes.. but for those of you who managed to buy at $400+ last month, relax! You're forgetting something so incredibly important about owning a share in general. . YOU NAME YOUR OWN PRICE! What is your share worth to you? And THAT is when you wait to sell it.. if it takes a week, a month, a year, the f*** cares? Can't wait that long? Then why the f*** did you buy it?

Forget these 10k and 100k and 1mil posts for a moment... As great as those numbers sound, there are still WAYYY too many paper handed pussies out there who brag 💎 ✋ throughout the different WSB subs... and the fact is, only a fraction of you are TRUE to your word. Want proof and evidence of this? Just listen in on any one of the Discord voice channels during market hours, scroll through these reddit posts, and listen to how many people say ""oh sh*t guys it's going down... duuuude WTF it's down like $3 from 210 bro what should I doooooooo""....


So here's my advice... and no I'm not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice.. its a life f***ing lesson... 

Set an alarm on your phone to notify you when GME hits 1k... set a second notification for 10k... set a third notification for 50k... set another notification for 100k... set another notification for 500k... and set the final notification for 1mil! And until it hits one of those prices, CLOSE YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN AND PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY AND FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE! Go to work, play with your kids... idc what you do, but stop bugging out over such insignificant price changes!! 5%loss is nothing when it's only a $200 stock! 

Take your ""diamond hand"" and either wrap it around your dick, your wife's ass, or your wife's boyfriends dick, and don't take it off until that notification goes off on your phone! 

And for those of you who day trade. F***you. No, I'm kidding. But seriously, f***you if you screw this opportunity for me. 

I love you all.  Especially the Mods","Some of you a bunch of pus****, I'm sorry...",1.0,1615244125,Bam607

If you add all that up, it's about 115,000,000 shares of Tesla (approximately 1/8'th of the entire company) at up to approximately $700/share. So if I'm reading that right, by the time of filing this report, Shitadel had bought 80 Billion $$$ of Tesla... 👀

&amp;#x200B;

According to [yahoo](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/institutional-holdings) the top institutional holder of Tesla is Vanguard at about 50M shares. Lol, Shitadel owns twice as much Tesla as the next biggest holder, and it's not even listed! Elon has a little less than half at about 227M according to [sec.report](https://sec.report). You smoothbrains should use it sometime, it was made for bureaucrat NPCs, after all. [CIK=0001318605](https://sec.report/CIK/0001318605)

&amp;#x200B;

Curiously, I checked out that company called ""CALC IV LP"", and funny thing is the person who files those... Her job is \*literally\* ""Global Controller"" Not even joking, like [wtf](https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-17-010014/)? What's also interesting is the last filing date for that company was near the end of 2017.
