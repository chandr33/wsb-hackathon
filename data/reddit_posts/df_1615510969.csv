**About**

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer (33% market share) in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

**Currently MX stock is at $23 a share with $6 net cash on balance sheet (that's right, 1/4 of market cap is in cash). MX also owns a 8"" or 200 mm (diameter) wafer manufacturing plant that produces 30k wafers per month, soon to be in the 45-50k wpm range that could be worth more than $250mm.**

This is one of the hottest assets as there is a global shortage of 200mm manufacturing space. [Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P)

* "" The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. ""
* “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”
* Used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.
* “You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available""
* Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory.

**Enter MX with its Fab 3 8"". Comparable transactions are listed** [**here**](https://twitter.com/ShortsHoward/status/1367321538966425600) **and values MX's foundry at &gt;$250mm.**

The business of producing OLED devices and power integrated circuits also generates $60-65mm of EVITDA in 2021 given the sharp growth profile.

For Sale: "" A source from the investment banking industry said many foreign firms – mostly U.S. and Chinese capital - have already expressed their interest and set up meetings with local securities and accounting firms to ready due diligence ""

At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x would imply an equity value of $1.5 billion, up from its current market cap of \~1000mm. There is also downside protection from its $280mm in cash and &gt;$250mm in foundry assets that don't appear on its PP&amp;E given heavily depreciated. (and before any business earnings).

**Background:**

I'm going to be talking about eXp World Holdings Inc ($EXPI). EXPI provides many products, but most notably their cloud brokerage firm, eXp realty. Per yahoo finance: ""eXp operates as a cloud-based real estate brokerage firm. It focuses on the development and use of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical brick and mortar offices and redundant staffing costs. The firm offers offers software subscriptions to customers to access its virtual reality software platform through VirBELA.""

The stock has seen a 52 week range of $3.26 - $90.00 and is currently sitting at $52.00 after hours post earnings (up ~13% on the day). Their market cap is right about 6B.


**Earnings:**

They absolutely crushed earnings, some notable details:

- Revenue increased 122% from Q4 2019 -&gt; Q4 2020, with the result of a record high - $609.3 million
- 15% increase in agents and brokers on the platform in Q4 2020 compared to Q3
- A record annual net income of $31 million

**The juicy deets:**

Ok, so now we have the background and some numbers, let's see why this is such an attractive stock. The competitors of EXPI include players like; Redfin (RDFN) - 7.91B market cap and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) - 8.96B market cap.

Both of those are at least 1.5 billion more in market cap, with technology that is far behind what eXp is offering. Traditional real estate brokerages can't even be taken seriously when comparing, because they lack the technology side of things that EXPI offers. Hell, EXPI literally owns a VR platform for creating 3D virtual office environments. Which that part of their business is not even remotely being reflected in their stock price. 

It's more fair to compare EXPI to the tech startups that are upwards of 10B market cap. Looking at it from that perspective, we see a 4 billion dollar upside. Or a share price of ~$71.

That share price of $71 falls right into the 52 week range I stated at the beginning of the post and is what I consider an accurate value for this stock. The technical analysis from myself and others clearly shows this price target forming:

https://ibb.co/dL6brDg

https://ibb.co/Sx16QGx

RSI and MACD are both turning up after a long downtrend from the ATH (90 -&gt; ~35). It found support around 40 and has bounced off of that up to $45 leading into earnings, which as stated before, were excellent. That caused the price to blow past the breakout area of ~51-52 during the AH session. 

This ship is headed for $70 very soon. It is certainly not going to be a GME type event where a 1500% return is seen, but a 40-50% gain on a company with good financials and future is something I certainly won't miss. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I just like the stock.

First, I am not a financial advisor,  just an ape who has a fascination with crayons. And honestly, the first  thing I saw when I  looked at this screen was a nice, big, tasty green crayon. After licking the phone screen a few times and realizing this was non-edible, I figured I would screen-shot this information to share with all of my crayon-loving ape-friends. Large-scale orders are indicative of institutional investing, so this gives us a tiny idea  about what they're up to. Were institutions buying in?  Was Melvin trying to start to cover?  Was Melvin&amp;co loading up on shares to sell off, short, profit from, hedge with, or what?

I then went back to stare at my lovely green crayon and noticed something quite distressing- *my crayon had shrunk!*

https://preview.redd.it/hn14maf7zhm61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd95e9f069c34e95a9f3062537f06cf080c57be1

After quickly checking my teeth for wax to ensure that I had not somehow managed to eat this green screen-crayon, I realized that the reason it shrunk was that large scale SELL orders had just increased from $18M to $24M  (see arrows).  My brain got a wrinkle- it itched- and then I decided to check the stock chart around the time these screens were taken. 

https://preview.redd.it/4mscoefazhm61.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d6c28dc12a63693bc4e24c1ddb1b2a93ad66f5

Would you lookie there.  A spike of sell volume all at once which drove the stock price down.  For a second, ape was confused... was it ""buy the peak and sell the dip!!"" or ""buy the dip and sell the peak!!""???  Ape was pretty sure dips were for buying, not selling.  My brain wrinkled again, it was annoying, and then I noticed this sell-off was the low of the day- seemingly trying to break the support level around $250.  But  it held!  Stock slowly rose, ape got distracted, wandered away.  At market close, I decided to check on my crayon again.... 

https://preview.redd.it/ea1zogvdzhm61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b745c8b033c02e973cc9e22050a6e22480d2ea5

APE WAS DISTRESSED, and then I remembered that I can't eat this crayon, and calmed down.  I looked up and saw that large-scale sell orders had increased to almost $39M, meaning around $15M of large-scale selling happened since I last checked on my crayon.  My brain itched again, so I checked the stock's chart for the end of the day: 

https://preview.redd.it/urb9umpgzhm61.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04dff771a124eba01d4acaa463d0ed21396cad6d

Another spike in sell volume at around $260 which dropped the price to again test our support level  around $250.  Ape double-checked to make sure dips were for buying and  not selling- TRIPLE CHECKED- and confirmed, selling dips bad.  Then I  remembered that GME is on the SSR list today, which means that Melvin cannot aggresively short the stock.  There's no rule, however, that prevents them from buying up a bunch of stock and then selling it off all at once, rapidly dropping the price of that stock.  Hmmm.... brain  is itchy.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really look like Melvin was buying up stocks to cover their short positions, it looks like someone bought them just to sell them off to screw with the stock price.  But that's just my crayon-eating hypothesis, who knows what the hell is going on.  🦍💎🙌","Large Scale Orders vs Price Action Today, 3/11",1.0,1615511659,G_KG

68,m365qu,"We all know there's a lot of manipulation going on all the time with any number of stocks we post about here, and obviously GME is the big one that we assume has the most manipulation going on.

But **what** is the **deal** with these days that close on an exact dollar amount? I don't want to engage in numerology, but I'd like to understand how this happens.

* 3/11 $260.00
* 3/10 $265.00
* 02/22 $46.00
* 02/09 $60.00
* 02/02 $90.00
* 02/01 $225.00
* 01/29 $325.00

I've made a cursory review of our other favorite stocks and my the rest of my portfolio and you don't see this very often, hardly ever, and here it is 7 times in just over a month.

I know a guy who talks about the ""psychology of round numbers"" (which he calls PORN 😃), but what's the deal here? Is the manipulator's target price somehow exactly $260 today?

Like myself, my smoothbrain-late-as-hell-stoner ass bought $GME after it dipped from it's lofty heights all the way to 76. It was literally the last bit of money I had in my bank account at the time... I forgot about it until my brokerage acct showed myaccount had nearly fucking tripled!  Fuck buds!
