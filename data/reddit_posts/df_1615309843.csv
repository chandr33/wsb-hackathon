Posting what might be a good options opportunity. Pharmaceutical company $ACAD went from $45/share to $24/share between close and open today. [The reason for this is the FDA has found postmarket and labeling deficiencies in their application for pimavanserin](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/acadia-analysts-cut-targets-as-fda-sees-application-deficiencies/ar-BB1epjWt). The company has until 4/3 to correct the issue.

That said, I believe the overcorrection today was massive. Even without this new drug on the market, the company still has Nuplazid in it's portfolio and 2019 revenue of $339 million. Their average share price over the past 5 years is $32.63 . 

The following price target changes were made in light of this news.  However, the stock has *immediately* pulled below even the least optimistic target.

* Stifel - DOWNGRADE from $68 to $27
* Jefferies - DOWNGRADE from $62 to $40
* Cantor - DOWNGRADE from $45 to $70

I see a lot of opportunity to make money with calls beyond April, where the position of the company will be more clear. If the deficiency is corrected prior to 4/3, the stock is almost guaranteed to go above $40 again. Since the nature of the deficiency is not yet disclosed, it could be something easily remedied.  Even if not, The current market price has overcorrected. A safe bet would be to balance long calls with April puts.

Example: June 18 $25c @$4.25 has a break even point of $29.25 at expiry.  Should the deficiency be corrected prior to April 3rd, this option has a 170% upside.

There is no feeling quite as gratifying as being told again and gain that you’re a fucking idiot, and you’re fucking wrong, only to watch your stupid ass plays make you more money than should be humanly possible, and in such a short period of time.

I should know, I’ve gotten to ride this train twice now. And I’d like to share some lessons that I have learned and relearned, only to constantly learn that every lesson I’ve ever learned in the stock market has been wrong.

1) When everyone is an idiot, no one is an idiot. I have seen time and time again that the smarter a person thinks they are, the less money they tend to make. The more sure they are about something happening, the less likely it is to happen. I couldn’t tell you why, but I can tell you that people say that /u/DeepFuckingValue is *objectively a bad trader* for not selling literally his entire position the last time it was at the top. $50000 to $10 Million dollars is, objectively, success. And that is what he has realized at this point in time.

2) IT IS NEVER BAD TO TAKE PROFITS. Some of you are probably looking at positions that have increased 2, 3, 10, or even 50 fold (especially you, people who bought options when GME was below $100 per share again and IV was lower) closing a portion of your position to recoup your initial investment is not greedy, it is the opposite. Pigs get slaughtered, and that is absolutely the truth. Selling 25% of your stake in a company to make sure that no matter where a stock ends up, you are still above your entry point, is a good thing to do. Don’t believe me? Believe DeepFuckingValue, who did literally this. Specifically with his options. Those are going to go down in value with time AND with descreased IV when the stock calms down (even if it calms down WAY above the strike price) and those are probably the best way to take your gains. And nothing is stopping you from reinvesting in GME. But if your entire life depends on that money, if you’re investing your mortgage or your loans or anything more than you can afford to lose, for fucks sake, why would you want to live with all of that stress?

3) No one has your best interests at heart but yourself. Yes, that’s right, me included. It is dangerous to openly share your positions with identifying information, and it is also dangerous to make your decisions entirely off of what someone else is doing.

4) Set your own sell prices. It doesn’t matter if it’s $500, $1k, $10k, or any fucking number. Pick a price to sell a portion of your position at the very least, and do it. Yes, I know I’m being sacrilegious by mentioning a number that is MORE THAN TEN TIMES WHERE THE STOCK WAS TWO WEEKS AGO, but this goes to the most important and simple rule.

5) I don’t know nothing, you don’t know anything, no one knows anything about the future. It is all speculation. The only thing that is real is the gains you have actually taken, and the only way those are real is if you realize them. I’m not, I REPEAT, I am not telling you to sell or to close any of your positions, but to have a point where you are comfortable selling at least a portion of them and stick to it. It helps me sleep at night, I’ll tell you that.
