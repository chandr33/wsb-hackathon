1). I give HFs an opportunity to buy my shares for cheaper than they are worth and close some of their short positions which will prevent the MOASS from being as big as possible...

2). I could risk missing a large spike if it were to jump up and then be forced to buy back in at a higher price and thus owning fewer shares...

99,m69nks,"First, before the GameStop brigade downvotes as soon as they see my account age, this is not my primary account, and I wouldn’t dream of poking the beehive on my main account. 

I’m not a WallstreetBets veteran, and I don’t pretend to be, but I do remember the days of DFV posting his fat 5 figure and 6 figure gains when GameStop was in the teens. 

Secondly, there have been numerous posts dealing with the tribalism that has taken over WallstreetBets, but unlike many of those posts, I’m not complaining. In fact I think it was absolutely necessary in getting GameStop to the legendary status that is it today.

This brings me to my actual point of contention. Where does this circle jerk end? When the lube runs out? When our hands are raw and bleeding? When both of our dads join into the circle? 

When GameStop hit $40 after its legendary run that changed the world, people sold, but the diamond hands remained. The General took on the world and rallied the troops with a simple yet effective jerking motion, “I like the stonk”. 

Is this going to create a “forever” culture where a small group of elite diamond hand retards truly just never sell? Hoping forever on the squeeze of a lifetime? (No, I don’t YET think the crescendo of this epic has come, I think a true hedge fund crushing squeeze is coming, but hasn’t yet and may never in actuality). I understand that the promise Ryan Cohen has put out would increase the value exponentially, so I know this isn’t a short term deal, and in fact will probably take another decade to play out. 

Is this sub forever going to be a meme filled echo chamber of GameStop? Does it stop when the Hedge funds finally back off of shorting and just let GameStop grow organically? Do people just suck off Cohen forever claiming he’s going to make GameStop the Amazon of games? (I mean we already saw a prominent DD explaining that over $1300 for a single share of GameStop is fair before any fucking work has been done to overhaul it). 

Does it end when that one random guy actually buys ALL of GameStop?

I’m not being snarky, I am not trying to slow GameStop, in fact, I think this dip is just the calm before a potential coming storm (yes considerably bigger than the $400 squeeze if the MOASS does happen). 

I genuinely want to hear from everyone and find out where everyone thinks this snowball that has turned into a rolling avalanche of liquid retardation fueled snowballs finally ends. (Or does it ever end? Can something that has impacted this many people and changed the world truly just fizzle?). I don’t know, and I don’t claim to know, I just know I’m definitely, definitely retarded.","Where do we go from here? A serious ask and discussion. Everyone welcome.
