70,lxs802,"Ticker: GAIA. Check out the relative strength in past few days.

This is a $30 stock based on today’s fundamentals if not more.  It’s very thinly traded and could break out very easily.  It’s the Netflix for spiritual and fitness/health type videos.  Micro cap with a lot of room to run.  Kind of fits into the AMC/GME type mentality given its “value is in the eye of the beholder” type nature.  

If people want a more full “DD” type post let me know but I don’t wanna waste the time as last time I posted this stock here I was flamed for the most part.",Both a value and growth play that’s up 4% today,0.46,1614884237,gonja619
