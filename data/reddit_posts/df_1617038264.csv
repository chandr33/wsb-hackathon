27,mfuvgh,"I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. 🤷

33,mfuz84,"First off, I am not giving you advice. I'm not a financial advisor, nor do I work in the pharma industry. I'm just sharing some research I did, and I'm open to all feedback and comments. Additionally (in full disclosure) based on what I found, I'm holding 450 shares because I'm still afraid of options.

Lets start off with some TLDR for the bullish thoughts and bearish thoughts.

Bullish points:

Based on fairly conservative COGS I have a share target of $19, but if that turns out to be overly conservative a more realistic value could easily push the share target to $24-$30. These values also assume fairly conservative adoption among the patient pool. The recent injection of liquidity also gives them plenty of runway to start cashing in on a fully approved drug (Orladeyo). Additionally none of this accounts for their developmental drug (BCX9930) at all which [has been racking up some big wins in clinical trials fairly recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and could push this to another level entirely. Considering that their Orladeyo drug on its own would support nearly double the current share price this makes a 10$ entry point fairly attractive with a potential bonus moonshot if BCX9930 takes off.

Bearish points:

Despite being approved, the rate of adoption of Orladeyo could take years to secure my estimated market share (I cant find any data to help estimate adoption rates). Drug trials can be a shot in the dark, and while currently there is no bad news regarding their up and coming drug BCX9930, a bad result would certainly draw enough negative sentiment to tank the price, despite Orladeyo easily supporting a share price of 19$ on its own. Additionally BCX9930 will need to complete trials for all of the numerous diseases they plan to market it for. Those trials will cost time and money and drag out for years. Lastly drug prices are in the focus of media pressure in the US which could likely have a negative impact on the pharma industry as a whole.

Now for the details. I'm going to talk through Liquidity, Revenue estimates, Cost estimates, and eventually arrive at my price target estimates. Lastly I'll speculate on some risks.

* Liquidity: In the 3rd quarter, they lost around 45M and had around 150M cash.  In Dec., they secured an additional 325M in liquidity (200M as a line of credit, and 125M as a 1-time gain which results in them paying a royalty on Orladeyo).  They have plenty of liquidity.  
* Revenue:  they have 2 drugs that I consider material.  Orladeyo which was approved in US and Japan, and is about to be approved in Europe.  BCX9930 which is far from approval in all but 1 disease in the US.    

   * Orladeyo is the only oral treatment for a rare disease known as HAE.  
   * Orladeyo will likely be sold for around 300000 per patient per year.  Biocryst set a price for sales in US of 485000, and will likely be sold for less in Europe, but I figure it averages 300000.  This price might sound obscene but is actually cheaper then its competition Takhzyro and Haegarda, which cost over 500000 per year.  
   * Orladeyo was actually only 30-44% effective in reducing HAE attacks, whereas Takhzyro and Haegarda are both around 80% effective.  However, Orladeyo is the only oral medication while Takhzyro and Haegarda both require injections.  The keys to Orledeyo are that it is a much more convenient and less invasive treatment, and despite its seemingly low effectiveness, it turns out that 50% of patients had a 70% reduction in attacks (while the other 50% probably saw little or no benefit, averaging to 30-44%).  
   * Also, in Biocryst's 3rd quarter conference call, management discussed a survey that they conducted, and found that about half of patients receiving injection treatments would consider switching to Orladeyo.  Since Orladeyo is effective in half of patients, and half of patients would consider switching, I conclude that Orladeyo could likely secure roughly a 25% market share
   * There are 7500 patients in US and 6500 in Europe.  If I conservatively assume 20% market share, their revenue would be .2\*14000\*300000=840M.  FYI, their guidance is ""north of 500M"".  
   * For sales in Japan, Biocryst made a deal with a pharma company called Torii.  Torii will sell Orladeyo in Japan and pay a royalty to Biocryst of between 20-40%, which will amount to around 15M in royalty revenue for Biocryst.  
* Costs  

   * After looking at various income statements, it looks like cost-of-goods-sold is generally 15-33% in the pharma industry.  I'll conservatively assume 33% for Orladeyo.  Gross profit is 840M\*.67 + 15M royalties=575M
   * In the [4th quarter](https://ir.biocryst.com/node/22286/pdf) they had 605000 in product sales (100000 was Orladeyo).  COGS was only 33000.  It's unclear how much of this COGS is attributable to Orladeyo or how much noise there is due to revenue still being so small, but 33000/605000 implies a COGS of just 5.5%.  This leads me to think my 33% assumption may be high.  If COGS turns out to be 25%, then gross profit would be 645M.   If COGS turns out to be 16%, then gross profit would be 715M.  I can't imagine COGS being any lower (otherwise the drug wouldn't cost 485000).  
   * As a result of securing additional liquidity, Biocryst will pay a royalty of 8.75% on the first 350M of sales, then 2.75% on sales between 350M and 550M, then 0 thereafter.  This amounts to a maximum annual royalty expense of 350\*8.75% + 200\*2.75% = 36M
   * SG&amp;A + R&amp;D + interest expenses were 50M in 3rd quarter, and increased to 62M in the 4th quarter.  They said they had infrastructure set up to market/distribute Orladeyo so I imagine SG&amp;A won't increase much, but R&amp;D will likely increase to fund further research of BCX9930 as well as other drugs.  I'll assume these expenses rise to 75M per quarter, or 300M annually.  
* Based on these assumptions that leaves profit of 575M - 36M - 300M = 239M.  Again, COGS is a major unknown in my model, but profit could be as large as 309M (in my 25% scenario) or 379M (in my 16% scenario)
* Share count was 176M in 3rd quarter, and increased from 110M last year.  I'll assume risk of further dilution to 200M.  
* EPS is 239/200=1.19.  I estimate a $19 share price based on P/E of 16 and COGS of 33% (This improves to $24 and $30 share prices in my 25% or 16% COGS scenarios respectively, both of which are more realistic than a conservative 33%).  **This is** ***before*** **considering the BC.0X9930 drug, which actually seems to be their primary asset.**  I did not see any revenue estimates for BCX9930.  But lets look at what we do know:  

   * 9930 is already close to approval to treat PNH in the US (here is some great [DD thats focused more on this new drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from [u/BIO9999](https://www.reddit.com/user/BIO9999/)), but there would only be around 300 patients in the US.  I found a presentation on Biocryst's [IR page](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) that listed other diseases that 9930 could treat, and I googled the prevalence of each in the US:   

      * aHUS - 600
      * ANCA vasculitis - 6000
      * Lupus nephritis - 12000
      * IgAN vasculitis - 66000
      * glomerulonephritis - inconclusive
      * primary membranous nephropathy - 3000
      * IgA nephropathy - 7500
   * It's unclear how many of these patients would need treatment with 9930 or what the price of 9930 would be, but there seems to be a **huge opportunity for 9930 to easily double my revenue/profit forecasts**.  This revenue is many years and many clinical trials away though, and may eventually face competition from other drugs, so I didn't include it in my analysis.  
* Risks:  (1) I did not consider corporate tax on their profit (though they probably won't pay much tax due to years of losses to carry forward).  (2) I've seen politicians tweet about obscene drug prices, and the bad press/political pressure may cause price reductions and instantly hurt the share price.  (3) According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus revenue estimates are only 56.8M in 2021 and 144M in 2022 (as opposed to my long-term estimate of 855M).  It seems it might be some time before they reach my revenue targets.  
* Again, I'm not that familiar with the pharma industry so I'm not really sure what will happen with COGS, R&amp;D, or SG&amp;A, but I tried to be conservative.  I never thought I would consider a pharma stock, but this really looks good around 10.  Thoughts?

85,mfvn4j,"They have 5.6 billion outstanding shares. Compare that to AMC's 450 million. AMC is trading at twice the share price, but the company isn't worth twice as much. NOK has \~5.5x the market cap. Share price is just 1 variable in the equation.

An $0.18 raise in share price of NOK is the same as a $2.48 raise in AMC on market cap. A 25% move in price of AMC is worth $1billion market cap, compared to a 4.5% move in price of NOK being worth $1 billion in market cap.

Arbitrarily saying $5 for NOK equates to about \~$8 billion more in market cap. What is the actual value of the contracts they have? And when will they start collecting payment on their contracts? And how are the payments structured and across what time frame? And that's just revenue, not profits. How many skilled engineers and technicians do the need to bring on to service and fulfil these contracts?

89,mfvovp,"MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.
