But the best way to give tendies to apes is by donating STOCKS not cash. (Note: US only)

1. Uncle Sam takes a lot of your tendies when you sell a stock, so you have less to give to apes🦧

2. Nonprofits don't have the same tax rules as smooth brained wsb retards 

3. Donating stonks directly to nonprofits means they get ALL the tendies and uncle Sam gets none

Almost all nonprofits that receive stocks have a policy of selling as soon as they're received so don't give them your GME! 💎💎✊✊ Give them less volatile non meme stonks.

Some (especially very small) nonprofits don't have a way to receive stocks, so you can also donate stonks through a Donor Advised Fund. Usually run through your bank like Fidelity or schwab, you give the stock to the DAF and they sell it and give the tendies to the apes. If you're gonna go this make sure it actually gets to the apes -technically you're allowed to keep your stonks in dafs indefinitely but that doesn't help any apes 🦧🦍🐒

The recent events of blatant market manipulation driven through the Robinhood platform by their investors and hedge funds partners is a dark day in America. We can only hope that SEC will do their job by exposing and arresting those involved beyond the CEO of Robinhood. The things we’ve seen over the years tells us that this won’t happen and the SEC response will not address the root problem. I hope to be wrong about that. While we wait to see the thievery of 2008 repeated by these scumbags let’s use the same approach on stonks, but this time in court. 

I lost an immediate 3500 by market manipulation invoked by robinhood and was forced out of position with an unknown loss on the upside because that. In California you sue up to 10k as a sole proprietor. If we all join together and bury these blood 🩸 sucking vampires with small claims subpoenas they won’t have the resources , time or money to address all of them. If a defendant does not show in small claim you win by default. I’ll post back with my results.

80,m69zcw,"Hey everyone, as some of you have probably noticed, I like to post technical analyses on GME as I am a technicals-driven trader (which is why I love GME so much). This post will be an examination of the ""short attacks,"" some catalysts and how they could help, and a bedtime story: a technical analysis of previous price action to crush paperhand anxiety. 

**Just a note:** Many have you have probably seen the DD that I've been putting out in the past few days. I'm using Yahoo Finance today instead of my usual TD because all of the lines on my TD charts make it difficult to see these charts and I don't feel like deleting them (see my previous posts if you wanna look at the absolute orgy of trend lines that I have on GME). 

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, I have a hentai addiction. 

**Short attacks:**  As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories. 

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 38rr4u1qaen61...*

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts**: As I have said in my previous posts, volume is the only way for a short squeeze to happen. A gamma squeeze could occur without volume but it is much less likely. Again, we will only see a parabolic move in GME if there is astronomical volume. On another note, let's say that in a month GME is at $1000 but this rise has been gradual and not parabolic, you should know that the squeeze has not happened. A gamma squeeze could've happened (or a few of them), but when the short squeeze happens, you will know. A short squeeze is characterized by a parabolic increase in volume and price (see the VW squeeze for a good example on this). Alright, sidebar over. Now, back to catalysts. The reason I went on that rant about volume is because GME has shown us that the only way for it to get significant volume is due to catalysts. Here is my previous post where I detail how volume is the driver of prices and how volume proceeds catalysts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5lk3l/bullish\_gme\_obv\_indicator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5lk3l/bullish_gme_obv_indicator/) 

Before I discuss these catalysts I want to emphasize the point that these are POTENTIAL catalysts, not predictions. Predictions can be dangerous because they can fuck with the smooth brains of new apes. Though I love it when people talk about dates and potential catalysts, I think that predictions are dangerous because they could increase paperhandedness (big boy word, wife's boyfriend will be proud). So, IMO, here are the potential catalysts that could cause massive GME volume and price hikes: quadruple witching day March 19 (will undoubtedly cause high volume but idk about price), earnings march 23 (not that important unless they blow earnings out of the park), earnings conference call march 23 (guidance report is important and any words reported by Ryan Cohen are huge), an announcement of a replacement CFO (could be anytime in the next few weeks/months, any announcement relating to Ryan Cohen, partnerships with other companies or acquisitions, Ryan Cohen being appointed CEO (biggest catalyst IMO but unlikely to happen). What's the point of these catalysts? THERE ARE MANY. The section below this will give a deep dive into why paperhanding doesn't make sense on a technical level and these catalysts are further reason why. GME rises on catalysts and there are many in the future. This should show us that GME has MANY opportunities to make more meteoric rises in the future. The fact that we are between 150-350 in Feb-March is HUGE because the catalysts have been weak compared to the future ones (CFO ousting, creating a board on shirt to digital). Finally, our boy rensole posted in his news update yesterday that Cohen told some inside investors that he has a plan to make GME go up to 1000 by the end of the year. I'll  let that marinate. In Cohen we trust. 

**Bedtime story:** The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**So anytime, you are feeling down about a GME crash or bad price action:** tuck yourself into bed, close all of your hentai tabs, hide your prostate massager, call your wife's boyfriend (assuming he and your wife aren't having a sex marathon), ask him to read you a bedtime story, when he asks what you want him to read say ""can you show me the GME charts that Uncle Hank posted on WSB."" If he doesn't make you sleep under the deck, get ready for the best night's sleep of your life. 

Also thought that I should share my GME position just so no one thinks I'm a shill cuck: 

3 GME Jan 22 950 Calls (yeah bitch I'm in this for the long), 5 GME Mar 19 400 Calls, 20 AMC Jan 22 40 calls (I have these because I think it will squeeze first, which will allow me to put more into GME), so yeah I'm over 80% in on GME and have both short and long term positions.","Today's GME technical analysis - crashes, catalysts, bedtime",1.0,1615903997,HomeDepotHank69

94,m6a13c,"ALWAYS make sure you have bullets left in the chamber. Plan your averaging points ahead of time, as well as the quantity you’re buying at each level. Don’t worry about the stock rebounding too early - that’s a win-win situation. 

And don’t average down with call options!! Especially when there hasn’t been a meaningful consolidation yet.

Corsair $CRSR makes high end PC peripherals and other pc/gaming parts. They are also making a huge push to capture revenue from content creators, which has a much higher margin. They are quickly becoming a major player in the industry. Everyone knows their name, their brand is slowly capturing market space in other sectors. A good article on this can be found online, search for ""Corsair gaming moving from player to contender""  

The stock was very much cyclical, +/- 20% ever couple weeks, with growing support and a bullish trend. Well, after a bottom the Nasdaq sell-off began and so did the $35 support of Corsair, crashing to the 20's for one day.

The financials of Corsair are amazing for a growth tech company. Seriously, find me one tech company that grew 70% YOY in revenue and is valued at a forward P/E of low 20's. Currently, they're trading at 2x revenue. That is insane, however, it's because their margins are lower as they don't manufacture most of their own products.

My favorite part of Corsair? They're buying up companies in which many are related to streaming and recurring revenue. Look at some of them:

Elgato (They are 100% focused on making products for content creators)  
SCUF (A streamer will want to showoff their custom controller and expect them to own more than just one)  
ORIGIN PC (Same as above. Showing off custom built products as a content creator)  
GAMER SENSEI (A coaching platform for gamers)  

Their Growth Strategy is as follows:
-Advance as the global leader in high-performance gaming and streaming gear.  
-Continue to develop innovative, market-leading gaming and streaming gear.  
-Expand into new gear and services that grow our market opportunity.  
-Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers.  
-Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales.  

Then there's the 3/22 lockup expiry. During a 3/12 investor conference the CEO Andy Paul (who I hope they replace, he's a tech nerd not a multi-billion dollar company CEO), stated there is nothing to worry about for the lockup expiry. They went with one investor who is not selling their shares. For the other 7 million+ shares they sold in January during a second public offering, they were purchased at $35! Do you think these investors will immediately start selling? If they do, it's two days of volume. It won't be an issue. Meanwhile, everyone is suggesting they'll buy AFTER lockup! By then, it will be too late. 

Finally, the short float is extremely high. Two things happen during lockup expiry. One, investors sell and the prices go down 10%-20%, and the shorts cover. Two, prices do not go down, shorts cover, shooting the price up 10%-20%.

This just in: They released a new keyboard and it's already sold out. Their products are on FIRE!

Bear Thesis:
-Gaming was a COVID play and will not grow in 2021.  
-Lockup Expiry 3/22 increases shares float.  
-Tech stocks are scary.  
-Low support levels as it crossed below MACD.  
-Earnings are low. They need to increase their margins.  

All of bear points are mute when Corsair continues to blow revenue expectations

TLDR: Corsair is a great long-term play. If you believe gaming to continue to grow and Corsair products to be great, it's a no-brainer. My EOY price target is $67",Corsair $CRSR DD - Double Your Investment Safely!,1.0,1615904158,Jeraldoo
