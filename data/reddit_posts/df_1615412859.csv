Throughout the call options held in GME up to $800, there would be around 340 million’ish shares needed to cover if those options were ITM and executed.

Do you understand that? That means that if you HOLD, they LITERALLY can’t win. They’ll be covering calls and increasing the price every step of the way and we can just sit back, put our hairy feet up, open up a banana, and watch the fucking massacre! 

It will trigger a massive gamma squeeze, which in turn could trigger a short squeeze afterwards. Not to mention that, at any point, GameStop could recall all shares to address why they’re over 100%, or do a split which would also expose the naked shares. Point being, EVERYTHING is in our favor.

**Hate the game, not the player.**

The came is global capitalism. Melvin, JPM, DTCC are all players in this game. We are overextending ourselves if we think pumping GME is going to do anything to our long-term exclusion from the wealth in these companies. 

I hate watching these losers post about ""good job sticking it to the hedge funds!!"" Stop it. BlackRock (the fucking worst, who wants to make dough off homelessness) is on our side.

Stop it. You're a poor fuck and 1000x 0 = 0. Only mega-whales or really early buyers are being lifted out of poverty by this game. We would do better to organize (actually organize) against the game itself, rather than pray lick up scraps.

19,m29sc7,"AAL issued a massive amount of debt today, roughly $10 billion to repurchase debt that was paying 11.5% by issuing debt that yields only 5.5%.

Sounds fucking awesome right.  

The issuance was oversubscribed by $35 Billion no less.

But while that is nice and all, the devil is in the details.

The company still burns 30 million dollars a day paying people to do work that isn’t making the company money.

The leveraged away their customer loyalty programs to secure the deal.  Meaning while the massive debt they just paid away looks great, the point being is that their company will see less in profits for the entire time the debt stays on the books.

Travel may be in a slight upswing, but here is food for thought, what if kids and teachers are working over the summer to get caught up in academics and people travel much less than anticipated?  That’s a realistic situation facing this country because otherwise an entire generation of children is being left behind.

Also I’m not convinced people are going to jump out and travel, I think a lot of people will be reluctant to and start by seeing friends and relatives locally before actually taking on more adventurous steps.

Business travel, the most lucrative kind of travel, has basically be scrapped by all major corporations unless it’s completely necessary.

There still aren’t going to be conferences where professionals travel to this year.  It isn’t going to happen.  

This is a classic buy the rumor, sell the news event because the stock itself has issued more shares in the last year to dilute and already terrible and diluted earnings.

You can hope to see a recovery, but until that day actually comes, this stock has the ability to really fuck people that are long on hope.

With the stimulus bill signed today, there isn’t much good news left in the market to be priced in.

Oil prices are on a steady increase towards $100 a barrel, and the airline industry which was horribly strapped for cash and could not estimate fuel demand last year underhedged their exposure.  Even if travel comes back, I hate to break it to you, it won’t be the airline companies making money, it’s going to be the oil industry.

 The total lack of coverage of the GameStop story was the last straw. Circuit breaker thresholds were activated numerous times, in both directions, yet nary a mention. This Over-coverage/No-coverage, depending on circumstances, has not gone unnoticed. By many.

  I was OK with Cramer and others pushing their agenda as it was obvious and predictable. This coordinated media manipulation was covert and unacceptable. I am certainly not the only one to notice, hence the ""inverse Cramer"" rule now routinely applied by many.

 Although it's too late to regain my trust, you would do well to stem this with transparency and and a large helping or Mea culpa.  GOOD LUCK

Everybody has seen this prelude before. 

If you are a journalist, of course you write the generic 'GME Went Down' story and have it ready to publish. 
Somebody was going to force the market to move. GME wasn't going to go straight up. Too many players want to play their plays.

So now Mr. ""Masters"" ""Degree"" in Communication publishes their prefab story and it looks a little planned instead of insightful. But where your income is mostly dependent on stimulus checks, theirs is based on clicks generated.

39,m29wtt,"Time to blast 1933 Industries to the moon! The $horts have been manipulating TGIFF for far too long.

My analysis on 1933 Industries and some Las Vegas Events coming up.

Allegiant Stadium will be a massive draw to Las Vegas. 65,000 base capacity, 70,000 for select events. The Raiders will be playing eight home games for the 2021 NFL season. My prediction is Allegiant Stadium will be filled to capacity. Garth Brooks July 10th, 2021 concert is sold out. Run the numbers. That is 590,000 additional visitors just from the NFL and one concert.

Now let's talk about Las Vegas new casinos. Circa on the north end of Las Vegas Boulevard opened on October 28th, 2020 and while it only has a 1,000 person capacity it is going to be a huge draw attracting the younger crowd that uses cannabis. The former Hard Rock Hotel site is scheduled to open as Virgin Hotels Las Vegas on March 5, 2021. Another visitor magnet and as I understand, it is a joint venture with Mohegan Sun. I stay at Mohegan Suns Uncasville Connecticut property a couple of times a year and it is a great resort.

Another cannabis revenue catalyst is Las Vegas's hot housing market. People are leaving liberal Democrat run states and states in which there has been a high number of natural disasters and California is leading the charge. I see Nevada's 2019 population of 3,080,000 pushing 4,000,000 in the coming years.

Here come some big revenues $$$.

NFL Events:

On June 16, 2020, the NFL announced that the stadium would host the 2021 Pro Bowl which has been deferred to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other Potential Events:

Stadium backers project 20 to 25 additional events per year outside of Raiders and Rebels games with additional plausible possibilities including the Super Bowl with a capacity of 71,835 seats, the NFL Draft, WrestleMania, the NCAA Final Four, the USA Sevens rugby tournament, Monster Jam, boxing matches, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events, other neutral-site college football games, international soccer matches, and corporate shows.

David Beckham visited Las Vegas in 2016 to advocate for the stadium as a possible home for his Major League Soccer expansion team, although he ultimately announced the launch of the team with a stadium in Miami. In 2019, it was revealed that Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley was engaged in discussions with MLS to land a team to play in the stadium.",1933 Industries - Alternative Medicine Association,1.0,1615413249,OmegaMan73

71,m2a156,"I have been watching RKT, GME, and AMC for the past week or so and Robinhood is most definitely up to some BULLSHIT.  

They have been showing lower than the actual volume on these going back to last week.  Like not even updating it.  Go look.  I looked at a bunch of blue chip stocks and their volume is current and accurate.

Also - pre-market and after hours, when price is moving downward, they update it instantly.  When price moves upwards, it is extremely delayed.  In the case of RKT it is super apparent because it has very low AH volume.  I currently have it up on 5 windows on my screen (marketwatch, tradingview, etc).  Price moves down, all of them within a second of each other including Robinhood.  Price moves up, all but Robinhood.  Sometimes a 10 second delay, sometimes 30 or more.

I wouldn't be surprised if this time delay is happening during trading hours as well on a smaller scale.  It's just so apparent during after hours with lower volume.  

Why would they do this you ask?  Well if you wanted to discourage people from buying certain stocks, but you're reputation can't take any more damage from the time YOU PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM BUYING CERTAIN STOCKS, then showing low volume and intentionally misleading pricing would be a sneaky ass way to do it.

Fuck you Robinhood.  I can't prove it but I know i'm not the only one seeing this shit.

Edit:  Before you say it, I am leaving Robinhood asap.  But I do not trust them to transfer my portfolio in a timely manner, and in a market this volatile, I can't take that chance of them being in limbo.

98,m2a58f,"**TLDR:** We bumped into a cloud on our way to the moon, we are fine.  
Noon today the GME rocket reached new heights, Now remember this is this rockets 2nd time flying, and sometimes it's scary. BASICALLY What happened this noon, was that we reached MAX-Q,  In rocket science that means: Going-Up = Difficult  
Sciencey quote: "" The **max q** condition is the point when an aerospace vehicle's atmospheric flight reaches **maximum** **dynamic pressure**. This is a significant factor in the design of such vehicles because the aerodynamic structural load on them is proportional to dynamic pressure. ***This may impose limits on the vehicle's*** ***flight envelope***.  ""  
That happens to every rocket as it leaves the atmosphere, and don't worry, we have examined the results from January's test flight, and this rocket is more than capable of passing MAX-Q and leaving the atmosphere.
