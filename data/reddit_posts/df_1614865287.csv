60,lxl1dk,"This is a company I invested in recently and as someone who spent a lot of time in the hospitality sector, their tech solves a massive issue of cash being a bitch to work with. This is one I think is still really early and I through some DD together below for anyone who invests in this sector.  


The MLSE is Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment. They own the Leafs, Raptors, TFC and several others. They're now yet another huge partner going cashless and using this tech to do so. NR below for anyone wanting to read that:  [https://www.xtminc.com/press-release-march-4-2021](https://www.xtminc.com/press-release-march-4-2021)

In a nutshell, XTM ($PAID /$XTMIF) is essentially a neo challenger bank that focuses on one of the biggest problems that most hospitality companies face -- cash is annoying to work with. XTM solves that issue with their Today Card which is a MC backed payment card. It enables restaurants and delivery companies to pay their staff instantly at the end of each day by simply topping up their Today card.

**The Tech:**

* Backed by AWS, RBC Bank, and Telpay
* Acquisition cost per user is $2 CAD (most banks can be upwards of $200 and other challenger backs range $1-$38)
* Allows employees to be paid instantly from mgmt (eliminates having to deal with cash)
* Anyone with their Today card can etransfer at no cost between each other
* Use the card like you would any bank card when making purchases

What really caught my attention with them though is who's been coming on board since covid hit. They've got the who's who from the Greater Toronto Area signed up (Pizza Pizza, Earls, Dominos, Cactus Club, etc). But its todays NR that gives such a bluesky feeling as these are huge names to not only begin switching over to their system, but have also invested in their recent raise.  
NR: [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/xtm-closes-strategic-investment-with-miami-s-groot-hospitality-and-harlo-entertainment-groups-886650089.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/xtm-closes-strategic-investment-with-miami-s-groot-hospitality-and-harlo-entertainment-groups-886650089.html)

Mike Kimel - This guy is the Chairman for Harlo Entertainment. Quick search of the investments his company works with paints a picture of how many places he can bring on board XTM [http://www.harloentertainment.com/investments/](http://www.harloentertainment.com/investments/)

David Grutman - I had to look him up but this guy is massive in Miami. His company Groot Hospitality owns a lot of the downtown Miami core and again, I bet he switches a good amount if not all of his companies onto XTMs Today card too  
[https://groothospitality.com/](https://groothospitality.com/)

David Bolno - Looking into him more you'll find out he manages money for Drake and Bieber and has some serious connections across North America  
[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/top-10-hollywood-music-business-managers-2018-1149535](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/top-10-hollywood-music-business-managers-2018-1149535)

These are 3 huge names to bring on board and they're a big reason why I think this company is about to explode as more and more restaurants/clubs/delivery companies come on board. XTM is about to have their user base grow exponentially which is both a data play (Data is King) and also grows revenues from these users using their cards everyday.",This Fintech Play Just Landed MLSE and is Removing Cash From Hospitality Industry,0.5,1614866152,TraderJones89

1. Look at Boeing. 
The worst news possible an Aviation company can have. Did the stock tank? No. Because large cap investors can recognize bad news from a death sentence. Earnings miss is not the end of the world and getting sued doesn‚Äôt mean shit. 

2. Google. 
Next quarter google and adt are releasing a new security system. Also the mere fact that google has a position makes me confident. Google wouldn‚Äôt let their baby fail

3. Volatility.
If this hoe can be this volatile on the way down I can‚Äôt imagine the way up.
