Once they were inside the Dark Vilayet, and walked in it, they felt under their feet something like small rocks, and heard something yell from within the Dark: ""Who takes these rocks, shall regret it, who does not take them, shall regret it""

Some thought: ""If I will regret it, why would I take any at all?"". Some others yet thought: ""I should take a few at least""

When they returned from the Darkness, back into the World, they saw it were all jewels and diamonds. The ones that did not take any, start regretting that they haven't, and the ones that did take, start regretting that they haven't took more.

I'm hearing and reading more and more frequently about how we are making history and this could be the largest wealth redistribution instance in history. 
I love what we are all doing and how this has really become a movement to stick it to the man. Last night I thought, ""man what better opportunity to make some serious change in this world if the average person like myself gain more financial wealth than I thought I'd come across?"" Fuck the hedgies. I'm excited to see what good comes from this. Everyone can still get their lambos and tendies but the astronomical amount of money this shit will generate for the average person will be life changing. and I for see many of us diamond handed autistic apes doing some great things just further proving the suits are some scumbag human beings and we're better than them.

Good Morning,

The music to this post is **Ice** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.

I own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..

**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.

I will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.

Before we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?

**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**

**Good news -**

u/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.

What we can tell from this folks is that shorty covered yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone things we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover.

# [Why Canoo](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_965/wp1ny0u99xitjwttmhq8.png)?

**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**

I spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.

Please see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.

/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted ""According to a recent [Mckinsey study, ""The New Realities of Premium Mobility,""](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""

But what about EV's in General.

Another [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.

1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.
2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.
3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \*
4. Affordability is coming.\*
5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \*
6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \*
7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*

We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.

Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.

Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  ""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""

He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further. 

Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?

To move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.

This shit is wild.

What perhaps some of you may not know (unless you read their last earnings call transcript word by word) of these **3 competitive advantages.**  


1.  **Competitive advantage: Fastest mortgage closing time in the country. Proof:** ""*Also closing even faster. So everyone says that their technology is great. How do you prove it? We believe it is faster. How do you make things faster and easier for consumers? The faster is very simply measured by an app, the CTC in that closing process. UWM was 18 days. The market is actually 56 days in Q4. And actually, in December, UWM was at 16 days, so lower. And the market actually looked like it got a little slower to 58 days. So the whole point is 18 days to 56 days, we're 3x faster than the industry.* "" - **their CEO a few days ago.**
2.  **Competitive advantage: Wholesaler mortgages are cheaper than retail mortgages. Proof**: ""*Our average interest rate for the whole year of 2020 was 3.08%. The market was 3.23%. So we are lower. We offer lower rates.""*  \- same guy.
3. **Competitive advantage: Lowest delinquency and forbearance rates (these are bad and you don't want those because you don't get paid) -**  *Also, you say, we don't do non-QM loans. We don't do riskier loans. We focus on doing the right loans, faster, easier, cheaper. That ties into also like how to -- hey, FICO is one way. How do I prove that? Let's look at our delinquency rates and our forbearance rate. The industry delinquency rate is 4.7%. Ours is below 2% here at UWM. The industry forbearance rate was 5.46%. Ours is below 2% at UWM. So we're better or twice as good as the industry average on those things.*

I propose we raise money to send DFV and his family on vacation to beautiful Sunny Isles Beach, Miami where he can casually stand on his balcony in a silk robe and toss $1 bills out over Gabe Plotkin's home. This vacation could allow DFV to casually run into Gabe Plotkin in a restaurant and buy him a drink. Maybe, see him on the beach and set up a long football throw that causes DFV to dive for the catch right in front of Gabe's wife catching her attention as the sun glimmers off of his diamond hands.

Degenerates were talking about a $10,000 investment for a week (AirBNB + Flights for DFV, Wife, and Kid), but it would be the perfect way to let DFV celebrate a life changing year.

**Short Utilization** \- 100

**Short Interest** \- 8.9 M

**Cost to borrow** \- 7.5

**Average age on loan** \- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28

What we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But thats the hopium read.

# Why Canoo?

**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**

I spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.

Please see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.

/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted ""According to a recent [Mckinsey study, ""The New Realities of Premium Mobility,""](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""

But what about EV's in General.

Another [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.

1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.
2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.
3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \*
4. Affordability is coming.\*
5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \*
6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \*
7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*

We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.

Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.

Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...

/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  ""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""

He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.

Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?

To move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.

This shit is wild.

What perhaps some of you may not know (unless you read their last earnings call transcript word by word) of these **3 competitive advantages.**

1. **Competitive advantage: Fastest mortgage closing time in the country. Proof:** ""*Also closing even faster. So everyone says that their technology is great. How do you prove it? We believe it is faster. How do you make things faster and easier for consumers? The faster is very simply measured by an app, the CTC in that closing process. UWM was 18 days. The market is actually 56 days in Q4. And actually, in December, UWM was at 16 days, so lower. And the market actually looked like it got a little slower to 58 days. So the whole point is 18 days to 56 days, we're 3x faster than the industry.* "" - **their CEO a few days ago.**
2. **Competitive advantage: Wholesaler mortgages are cheaper than retail mortgages. Proof**: ""*Our average interest rate for the whole year of 2020 was 3.08%. The market was 3.23%. So we are lower. We offer lower rates.""*  \- same guy.
3. **Competitive advantage: Lowest delinquency and forbearance rates (these are bad and you don't want those because you don't get paid) -**  *Also, you say, we don't do non-QM loans. We don't do riskier loans. We focus on doing the right loans, faster, easier, cheaper. That ties into also like how to -- hey, FICO is one way. How do I prove that? Let's look at our delinquency rates and our forbearance rate. The industry delinquency rate is 4.7%. Ours is below 2% here at UWM. The industry forbearance rate was 5.46%. Ours is below 2% at UWM. So we're better or twice as good as the industry average on those things.*

Let’s face it, hedgies have shorted the stock significantly and the only way out is to close their position. Are they trying to do so slowly and gradually without triggering a squeeze ?? And every time they rid themselves of a few positions, the media will justify it as “normal” response due to “normal events”. In other words, they are trying to prove that “we retarded monkeys don’t have the power, it’s because of Cohen’s move....this is rational....you have no power to cause a short squeeze....don’t try this anymore...”

Maybe I am overthinking this and I wanted your opinion on the matter.....in my opinion, this has nothing to do with Cohen....if we hold, the stock will go up....regardless....they just want us to think that we are powerless and it is not because of us

Good Morning,

The music to this post is **Diamond** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.

I own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..

**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.

I will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.

Before we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?

Poser.

**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**

**Good news -**

u/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.

**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\*cough Cough\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\*cough cough\***

**Short Utilization** \- 100

**On Loan -** 7.29M

**Short Interest** \- 8.9 M

**Cost to borrow** \- 7.5

**Average age on loan** \- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28

What we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But that's the hopium read.

Or they are could just be reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list... Premarket looks great just sayin....

**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...

**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**

Again, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...

# Why Canoo?

**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**

I spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.

Please see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)

DT points to a COX 2019 Automotive study.  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.

DT also noted ""According to a recent Mckinsey study, ""The New Realities of Premium Mobility,"" 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** ""

But what about EV's in General.

Another study by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.

1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.
2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.
3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \*
4. Affordability is coming.\*
5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \*
6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \*
7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \*\*\*\*\*

We can see where Canoo can come in with the **\*** and provide advantageous market position.

The B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the Apple Canoo Article... But do we know about the Jack Ma talking to Canoo article?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.

Their Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.

Speaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...

DT  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  ""***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said ""can you get us the truck by then too?*****""**""

He just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into Thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.

Some people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?

**Why am I breathing hard?**

I just got done moving some goalposts.

What might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **""We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.""**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.

This shit is wild.
