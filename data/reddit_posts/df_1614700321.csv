**OVERVIEW:**

Owlet Baby Care building the premier baby-tech company with the connected nursery and digital parenting platform as part of the larger ecosystem. Just like Peloton is building a hardware/software/subscription ecosystem for fitness — Owlet is doing the same thing for parents and caretakers.

I’m not a parent so I can’t speak to these topics from personal experience but I have 5 nieces and 4 nephews plus many of my closest friends are parents so I know first hand how obsessed new parents are with their babies and how they are in a constant state of worry and panic. Every time their baby gives them a funny look or starts to cry they begin to freak out. Obviously these fear dissipate over time but how amazing is it that now we have a company like Owlet that is providing the products and services to make the parents job a little easier and less chaotic.

Owlet has already developed a very strong brand in the baby-tech industry with great retail partnerships, numerous awards and a strong IP portfolio ([patent search on USPTO website](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=owlet&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=owlet)) but going public via $SBG will increase awareness of their products and help them hit their ambitious business goals.

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

Owlet is redefining the way in which parents are supported by technology and empowering them to proactively monitor the health of their newborns to not only protect the baby but also give them piece of mind.

The baby-tech industry is many years behind most consumer tech markets so it’s excited to think that we have a chance to get in early while this trend is just taking off. As you can see below, thousands of babies die every year from SUID (sudden unexpected infant death) and Owlet can help prevent this.

Just like car seats are a must-have product for every parent to keep their baby safe in the car, I expect the Owlet smart sock to keep their baby safe the other 23 hours of the day.

Owlet has a huge lead on other baby-tech companies with their world-class design and engineering team plus years of gathering and analyzing data. They already have 1+ million customers and with the brand loyalty they have developed it now gives them the platform they need to launch new products and expand the ecosystem thus creating more LTV (lifetime value) from each customer.

Let’s also not overlook the fact that 4+ million babies are born every year in the US which give Owlet a constant new supply of customers and their loving parents who want to keep them safe and healthy.

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1. current product portfolio
2. product pipeline
3. existing retail distribution with more on the way
4. 1+ million existing customers
5. FDA clinical trials already underway
6. robust R&amp;D process
7. $300+ million on the balance sheet
8. strong brand awareness and NPS scores
9. strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]
10. seasoned management team

**FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.
