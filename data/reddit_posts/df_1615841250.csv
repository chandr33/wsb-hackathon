7,m5uiov,"Hey all,

I've been wary of a certain meme coin for a while. And I've been wondering why a wrinkle brain like Elon is pumping an inflationary joke coin. I digress... I now think people are so enamored with the idea that that certain meme coin is going to make them rich somehow that they're blind to what's really going on. And I'm pretty sure what's really going on is that Musk is pumping Sirius XM, a company named after a star in Canis Major, the greater dog.

Elon's tweets yesterday mention Sirius and refers to the dog days of Summer. The dog days of summer idea comes from Ancient Greek/Roman belief that the return of the Dog Star was responsible for bringing heat and fever. And the dog days were marked by the return of Sirius each year.

Then he and DFV tweeted about music. And SpaceX has already launched SiriusXM satellites. 

[https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/](https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/)

On Falcon 9. Which Elon tweeted about twice yesterday too. I think everyone is sleeping on something huge because of all the stupidity with that coin that must not be named.

And SiriusXM is a low risk play to me. Cheap and potential that Elon pump catalyst happening. Not financial advice, but this one gives me serious fomo.","Sirius XM ($SIRI) - I think Papa Elon tweeted about Sirius XM yesterday, not that coin that shall not be named",1.0,1615841372,JessasaurusJames
