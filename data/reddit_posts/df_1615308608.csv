4,m1am4x,"Let me start by saying I'm poor. Comfortable but quite poor in the grand scheme of things. I got into stocks in Jan when GME peaked.

This is my GME journey:

Buy 3 @101

Sell 1 @50

Buy 2 @47

Sell 2 @135

Sell 1 @187

Sell 1@192

Profit is approx $300.

I'm using this money as a reason to buy a series S for a struggling person I know. I have other stocks that are all red but GME is the big daddy of them all.

Even now as GME keeps climbing and I missed out on gains I'm happy with my decision. It's honestly a relief and the potential to gain or lose more is perpetual and inevitable. This is gambling pure and simple.

If you don't have a lot of money and you break even or profit, it's ok to sell.  If you are holding for a certain amount or indefinitely you have my greatest commendations.",It's ok to sell for profit or to get your money back,1.0,1615308661,MichaelDokkan

36,m1aohq,"I’ve been in the networking and data center business long enough to know that DATTO is becoming a serious player in the field. Listed on the exchange just October of last year only, only a few short months ago, this stock hasn’t seen much growth.

I have a feeling their earnings release will come with some great news and the stock is severely undervalued due to the obscure nature of complex computing and how DATTO comes into play with quality products at modest prices compared to Cisco, Brocade, and Ruckus.

They have a large network of Managed Service Providers (MSPs) using their DaaS and SaaS verticals. No major breakthroughs for the technology or their software but it’s an easy, intuitive, and manageable interface they offer for complete control of an IT environment and they sell almost anything that goes on your stack. I’d say they’re the “Zoom” of actual IT work but that would be an oversimplification.

Dear Apes.  

Watching the GME stock market launch from my POV in the side lines is the best euphoria I had in a long time.  I wasn't there when Apollo 11 got to the moon and this is just as good if not much better.  

One of my triple monitor setup is dedicated to the GME stock in tradeview and this subreddit since January this year, the other monitors are for porn and stuff. Watching all the bs in the mainstream media has also been a hell of a show,  made some popcorn a few times and i'm loving it, this event is already in my history books and i feel this is just the beginning.  

I share  these words with you brave wonderful apes with the intention to show my respect and appreciation to all mammals playing diamond hands in this game. Thank you all and  keep up the good fight!
