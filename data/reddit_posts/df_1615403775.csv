9,m25vlm," 🍌? Yes.

Financial advice? No.

So this looks exactly like January. We tanked, then got back up, it might very well be that we'll see the markets close around the 260 mark today.

In January, the markets opened the next day, the price shot back up, the scared ""HODL""ers sold to ensure some modest gains, the price tanked again. If that hadn't happened, we'd be past Saturn now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my elegant conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

You apes might be thinking of selling, now, but I encourage you to HODL through tomorrow's spike (do you like the stock or what?). We haven't had enough WS tears yet.

I expect that today happened because many bought in at 340 and cared about nothing else than to break even and to leave at least at 0. 🧻

We got rid of the cowards. HODL to the moon now.

I'll be riding the wave. but this ride has moments of anxiety and can cause sleepless nights for those who constantly think about missing profits.

If your trading platform has conditional orders like TD ameritrade has, this is what i'm doing and not freaking out if price drops...so move your finger off the trigger...

this is an example of what i'm doing with conditional orders.  
Example: so now the price is at $260... i placed a conditional if bid drops to $205 i sell X amount of shares at $195. AND then with the earnings you can buy more at dips then pocket your initial investment.  
so, daily i keep moving the target price up following the price increase.

No more worrying about missing profits...AND it helps to continue HODLing without anxiety...

63,m25yzm,"$ABML, soon to be $ABTC (American Battery Technology Company) was attacked today by short firm Spruce Point Capital, with a number of phony accusations. $ABML is focused on battery recycling from EV's and other tech. Here's my DD on the company:

$ABML has Ryan Melsert as CTO and Menka Sethi as COO. So what? Well, Ryan Melsert was the former chief of battery development at Tesla Gigafactory 1 in Nevada for 5 years, personally praised by Musk himself as a lithium ion battery genius. American Battery's pilot plant, which is in the final stages of permitting for construction, is located 18.6 miles down the road from the gigafactory. Why would a star Tesla player move 18.6 miles down the road to start a battery recycling plant? Hmm. As for Menka Sethi, She was formerly at Facebook, where she specialized in finance operations and facilities. Both people are tremendous assets to the company, with a winning track record. These are just two of the people on the board that I think are winners. 

JB Straubel, Co-Founder of Tesla, has recently entered the battery recycling space as well with his private company, Redwood Materials. This proves that this is going to be a lucrative market if these Tesla players have left to pursue it. 

Tesla has a grand vision of converting the world to a sustainable energy economy. If we cannot recycle these EV batteries and get the raw materials back, then this is not a closed loop system and thus not sustainable. $ABML seeks to fill this gap and profit massively from it. 

Spruce Point Capital says that they do not have their permits, when in fact Fernely, Nevada's own website lists the permits as in progress. They make a number of bs claims in their report and have a large short position in the company. Spruce Point has Andrew Left 2.0 leading them and has attacked many other successful companies. We cannot let them win. 

$ABML has not been allowed to give material company updates yet, which include partnerships and other technology related information on the pilot plant. They are waiting for approval of their S3 with the SEC to do so, which is expected to clear later this month. I look forward to what they have to say.","$ABML Lithium Battery Recycler Attacked by Shorts, Here's Why They're Wrong",1.0,1615404033,TrevorTrades

66,m25zbg,"Put simply, a short ladder attack is when both sides of the buying and selling of stocks are played (by traders(in this case HF)) in an attempt to devalue the stock in question. Shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with fake shares. (To anyone who doesn't or is confused on what just happened, a build up of a short ladder attack combined with the short attack the HF did lead to a the price of GME/AMC to fall massively, Basically if you guys want tendies buy up the ones they sold)

Now what is a short attack you may ask well, a short attack is a carefully planned and coordinated attack by an activist short seller(HF in this case) that involves taking a large short position in a company then attempting to drive the share price down by the release of negative information( im too lazy to write it in my own terms so that's the google def)

In a sense what they are doing isn't that illegal since they are just buying up large amounts of shares and selling them all off at the same time no different from you or me.(except for the naked shorting which should be considered illegal, but is insanely hard to track by the SEC that their is no point to it)

However, if (lets say best case scenario) everyone holds their shares for the remainder of the week, we could see a possible rise again around triple the amount of what we saw today, so the short borrow interest rate will go up causing the hedge funds to cover their positions at an absurd amount which will cause the prices to go up even further.

Name of the game is supply and demand. Basically they want the supply to go up by pumping the stock with IOU's(fake shares) to force the demand to go down causing the price to drop rapidly(someone who explained it pretty well is Trey Trades

Now will the price go back up and will i make my money is probably what you are wondering right now. To me i believe it will but the stock market is very unpredictable and for both GME/AMC everyone needs to hold their shares and buy up the ones the HF just used to short us with, but you do what you wanna do.

Now to conclude this way too long post for something way too simple, the stock market is all about how you look at it. Is the price on sale or did you make a massive fuck up. Do you like the stock long enough to stay with it. Are you financially stable to hold onto this stock for the long run or can you only hold onto it for a short time.

The way you look at the stock market will always be the way the stock market reacts. For instance i saw this market crash i thought to myself damn, that's some nice loss porn there i wonder how much its gonna hit now gme 500k-1m, amc 10k-100k.

Lastly i just want to say we are changing the market forever, even if we make money or not, who knows maybe shorting a stock will become illegal or maybe Hedge funds wont be allowed to make just large number of buy orders, or maybe just maybe we are all apes in a dream on a moon just like our lord and savior DFV.

Do you think GME will go back through the cycle of dropping back down to the $40-$80 range for a couple weeks before they have to cover their new shorts and this just starts over? Or do you think people are going to long hold it all the way through? (And I'm not talking a small few who still held since Jan, I'm talking about everyone who bought the dip at $40-$120 past month).","I'm Pondscum, but what if this latest drop was similar to the one when it hit $480 last time?",1.0,1615404225,established82
