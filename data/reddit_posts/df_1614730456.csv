3,lwggp3,"Ok you apes, I know everyone is probably distracted by the rest of the shit going on in the market but GO just had their earnings call today 3/2 and they fucking crushed it. In typical fashion what happened? the stock TANKS all the way down to $34 which is an INSANE VALUE. This stick was a bargain around 37-38 but now it's just free money when this thing rebounds back to 45 where it was less than a month ago.

Here are the highlights of the earnings call today in case you missed it:

* Net sales increased by 23.1% to $806.8 million, which includes $53.3 million from the 53rd week.
* Comparable store sales increased by 7.9% on a 13-week basis over a 5.1% increase in the same period last year.
* The Company opened eight new stores ending the quarter with 380 stores in six states.
* Net income increased 146.8% to $24.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 46.1% to $24.2 million, or $0.24 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 24.7% to $51.2 million.

This is all good news for us and only proves that after the sell off after earnings this thing is going TO THE FUCKING MOON!🚀

Here are some highlights from 2020 compared to 2019:

* Net sales increased by 22.5% to $3.13 billion.
* Comparable store sales increased by 12.7% on a 52-week basis compared to a 5.2% increase in the comparable period last year.
* The Company opened 35 new stores and closed two stores during the year.
* Net income increased 592.1% to $106.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 86.9% to $112.7 million, or $1.14 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 32.4% to $222.9 million.

AND if that wasn't good enough here is what things are looking like moving forward for us.The Company currently expects to open between 36 and 38 stores this year with one closure. They anticipate that comparable sales for the first quarter will decline in the negative high-single digits reflecting the impact of cycling the initial demand surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Excluding the impact of discrete items, they anticipates a normalized fiscal 2021 tax rate of 28%.apital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are estimated to be approximately $130.0 million.

This is an extremely cyclical stock and moving into spring and summer are the biggest months for GO as cooking and overall grocery shopping increases. I can't overstate how undervalued they are right now at $34 and the calls are DIRT CHEAP.

Positions or GFTO:

3/19 40$ Calls - 35

4/16 40$ calls - 50

6/16 40$ calls - 50

I know march 19th seems soon but this thing is going to rebound very quickly with the rest of the market and they are so cheap I couldn't pass them up. WE WILL see $45 by the end of March, I am NOT financial analyst, I eat crayons with a straw, please do your own DD.

7,lwggvx,"This sub has devolved into pumps and dumps and constant shilling. 


You can barely find any DDs anymore because all of them shill GME or RKT and daily discussion threads are 90% about GME or RKT even though there are containment threads. 


I’ve been lurking here for years and it sucks to see this community become even more half brained than it was. All of the loss porn and interesting option plays that made this sub great are now overwhelmed with a bunch of propaganda. I won’t be surprised if a large amount of comments supporting certain stocks in the daily are written by bots.


The point is coming close where something REALLY needs to be done to preserve the shred of smooth brain intelligence this place had before GME blew up. 


Whenever a stock pumps like crazy, the mods should ban all mentions of the tickers for 48 hours or some shit in the daily threads. Keep that shit to the containment. 


Or even ban the ticker discussion for 48 hours across the entire board. Allow DD with insights to be posted after this lockup period. 


I don’t want to see sub 1 bill market cap trash being pumped. I don’t want to see GME being pumped and dumped every 5 minutes or RKT. Who does? IMO, the SEC is going to rip this place to shreds at some point under the guise of protecting investors.

Saw this post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwc8du/rkt\_most\_effective\_use\_of\_my\_600\_dollars/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwc8du/rkt_most_effective_use_of_my_600_dollars/)

And I'm scratching my head. How the fuck do you turn $600 into $15,500?

I've tried exercising my google-fu but I can't find a clear answer. My understanding of how these call options/contracts/black magic fuckery works is basically...

You front some money (the contract premium, which varies based on factors) so you can buy a bunch of stocks (100) at a lower price once it rises above a certain price.

So if you're eyeballing a stock at like... $10 and thinking 'I like that stock, it should see $20 easy', you buy a call option (or 10, or 100, or fuck if I know) and set the 'strike price' at 20.

Stock moons to 50, and you get to buy each at 20, netting you 30 per.

That makes sense to me.

What DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE TO ME is how you turn $600 into $15,500. You still have to front the money to buy those stocks right? You can't just immediately turn around and sell them to make money magically appear without first paying for them, right?

So how the fuck?

I read something about selling the contracts instead of exercising your right to buy? Is that how this happens? How does that work? Wouldn't you have to find a buyer for the contract? Or can you just turn around to the seller and say 'Lol, I can has money'? and immediately sell the contract to the seller? Or are contracts always in high demand?

Even that makes no sense, because what's stopping someone from setting a dumb strike price of like... $12 on a $10, and then turning around and immediately selling the contract for like... $1,200 ($12 x100 = 1,200)? Is the premium high enough to dissuade that sort of bullshit?

98,lwgu5b,"This Sub needs a HARD Reset

This sub has devolved into inflating/advertising and deflating/selling (p and d) stocks and constant shilling.

***

You can barely find any DDs anymore because all of them shill GME or RKT and daily discussion threads are 90% about GME or RKT even though there are containment threads.    


I’ve been lurking here for years and it sucks to see this community become even more half brained than it was. All of the loss porn and interesting option plays that made this sub great are now overwhelmed with a bunch of propaganda. I won’t be surprised if a large amount of comments supporting certain stocks in the daily are written by bots.    


***


The point is coming close where something REALLY needs to be done to preserve the shred of smooth brain intelligence this place had before GME blew up.    


***

Whenever a stock is bought/advertised like crazy, the mods should ban all mentions of the tickers for 48 hours or some shit in the daily threads. Keep that shit to the containment.    

Or even ban the ticker discussion for 48 hours across the entire board. Allow DD with insights to be posted after this lockup period.    


***


I don’t want to see sub 1 bill market cap trash being inflated (p’d). I don’t want to see GME being advertised every 5 minutes or RKT. Who does? IMO, the SEC is going to rip this place to shreds at some point under the guise of protecting investors.

Im just a normal guy who works in building maintenance so thats all i can swing right now and do my daily sports betting and other regular buys.  But I have family members on my wifes side who work for hedge funds and they are 100% assholes and i hope they get knocked down several pegs while getting repeatedly kicked in the dick during their fall.  If i can make a few extra bucks to fund some of my golfing/drinking this summer, even better.  Ill be holding until the bitter end no matter what.  Cheers.",Get em !,1.0,1614731677,3puttbogeyking
