While speaking to my friends, we all seem to universally agree on one thing; shit started getting weird as soon as Harambe (bless his soul, hope your dicks are still out for him) was killed.

As of the past few days, the trend on WSB has been to adopt gorillas and apes alike. We also see the emergence of a meme ""Return to Monke"". We've all been thinking about it figuratively, but I think it was supposed to be literal. A repayment for the wrongs done against Harambe.

And finally, the letter GME. Harambe was a Gorilla. Shot in May. It was an Execution. G. M. E.

Because of these facts, I believe that we have repayed our debts for the sins we've committed against our ancestors. If we return to a normal form of reality, 2016 to 2020 will be known as the Chaos Ape Loop. (Which, as a bullish sentiment, says ""CAL"")

25,m573a4,"In all seriousness, what would it take for Palantir to become a household name in most businesses in the country? In my line of work we constantly encounter problems because certain systems don‚Äôt talk to one another, and we waste valuable time waiting for a human to compute and share since our systems are not able to communicate. We are spending millions of dollars buying more and more systems that talk to most of our other systems, but ultimately not all of them. It‚Äôs frustratingly painful, especially when we have to move quickly on a decision. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined one software that could lock everything together in my business until I heard of Palantir. 

I can‚Äôt think of one other line of business that doesn‚Äôt have multiple siloed systems. This is a constant problem and one that is widely excepted as a fact of business life. We often pay human beings to act as the courier between systems, secretaries, administrative assistance, people that generate reports from one system to send it to another because they don‚Äôt talk to each other. How crazy is that? Inefficient is what it is. 

Valuable time, money and energy has historically made America‚Äôs businesses slower in competition with the world because we depend on human beings for so much of the computing work- - work that a system like Palantir can apparently do easily. Nobody seems to ultimately have the fix that Palantir could bring. This detachment of systems within any American organization delays us in the global marketplace. 

I know Palantir goes after the big dogs, but imagine if they sold an operating system to small businesses? What if they sold to education? What if they sold to mom and pop stores? Think of how efficient our world can be. We would be talking about a Microsoft or Apple OS on steroids.

34,m575iw,"Here we go, another entry into the series for my own amusement as I jot things down and attempt to make legal nonsense, sense. If you other apes gain a wrinkle or two too, well that's just gravy.

Part I here

Let me clarify first, the point of this series is to grant a better understanding for us apes on how the NSCC (and DTCC) does business, or any other legal stuff for that matter, relating to securities. This is to prevent FUD surrounding quotes of rules or rulings which, when taken out of context, seem like they won't help / cause fear in the DTCC and co won't pay or find a way out of paying when the inevitable squeeze happens, in addition to the new rule.

*If you don't want to read my stuff, just know the DTCC **is** and remains on the hook should a member default and they have so much credit, cash and assets the squeeze will hurt, but never finish them, maybe*

Anyway, I had the thought that surely the NSCC (and therefore by extension, the DTCC and sister companies) doesn't just wait until the proverbial shit hits the fan, or waits till the ass is primed in the fan's direction after a spicy meal, before it decides to protect itself. Big money likes to stay big money. You may think well no shit, but I doubt many of you know exactly how they do so.

This DD relates to what the NSCC and co does *before* a member (such as Citadel) or their family affiliates securities (such as Melvin) Default and enter Rule 18 i.e. Part I and defaults), **in addition to the new SLD filing**.

As always, not financial advice, do your own research and if that means you point to me and say stupid ape wrong, I'm glad to hear it. Fling it at me.

Onto the DD, it actually relates to an amendment of rule which is thankfully 10 pages long.

The rule amendment I'm looking at (File No. SR.-NSCC-2017-010) relates to how the NSCC detects funky trade moves from members and affiliates, and determines margin payments. Remember the NSCC handles the majority of clearing, so they know what's been traded, in the vast majority of cases. 

The FICC also knows what they're worth too, so they can assess a member and any affiliates' ability to settle their portfolio when things get hairy, both from a portfolio and financial standpoint. The NSCC and FICC work together on this.

So the NSCC has something called a 'risk matrix' which helps them determine a member's margin, or a charge they have to pay into the NSCC's clearing fund, depending on how much risk their portfolio places the NSCC under with respect to their positions and financial clout.

I can't shake the imagery that this rule is like members and their affiliates are aware the market is a simulation and get slaps on the wrist if they fuck with it, whereas we apes are forced to play by the rules, until we came along and ate the red pill that is GME when they were caught with their pants down. I digress.

The clearing fund is the 'uh oh someone may default and we need to settle' cash reserve, and it is collected from all members, even those on the right side of trades. They just pay less, but every member has to pay into it to protect the NSCC, the price of membership. The difference is, those more in risk pay more to account for their risky portfolio.

As I said, the risk matrix extends to all members and affiliates, and it represents a measurement like a credit rating. To calculate the risk, the NSCC gathers up all their member's portfolio info and the FICC tells them what each of their financial capabilities are. An algorithm then determines a rating.

As an example, you're potentially in the hole for $2b and you have a total assets and liquidity of $2.5b, matrix sends alarm bells to the NSCC of crap this member's or this affiliate is in the shit, scrape some money now or it'll hurt you later. A good member may get AAA rating if their risk is nowhere near what they're worth, so a token donation from you.

Further, if you find yourself on the NSCC watchlist, well your margin payment is going to increase too. Those on the watchlist are essentially those with a bad 'credit rating"" in the eyes of the matrix, who either continue or increase in that position, or else have failed to raise enough capital to balance their risk relative to their assets or both. This rule SPECIFICALLY brings in affiliate investments, likely so risky positions can't be held in such entities without risk.

*An aside - could this be why Citadel invested in Melvin? It's speculative but imagine you've lost billions and then you're slapped with a fat margin bill as you can't exit the position or else default, seems like a great time for a predatory institution to come in and grab your shares at discount prices. Just saying.*

So how does this relate to the situation? Well as Part I described you want to avoid defaulting as much as possible or else your ass gets liquidated.

Speculation: Now imagine you're a Melvin who's lost billions and doesn't have the capital to front the charge for your risky position, you then default and your ass gets liquidated and that's you done, out the market. Citadel steps in and 'invests' in you so you can sell out your risky positions to them and you can legally say you closed out your position and their assets make the charge less because your position in the matrix is better as you're better capitalized.

Next, you try and tank the stock but it doesn't work. Citadel then has the increased charge for their position with each day that goes by. The current SLD is measured against the last 24 months trading and the investment into Melvin you can hide as it wasn't your investment, but you're eating a lot of money in interest.

The longer this goes on for higher prices, the quicker you're done. When the SLD rules come into place and the NSCC demands a larger sum of what you can handle when the rule change passes, you default and they settle you out. The incentive is only to keep kicking the can down the road and pray retail gets bored as both of you are done if this doesn't happen. Which it won't if apes hold.

TLDR: this situation for Melvin and Citadel is like being stuck in an underwater cave and finding an oxygen tank from another trapped person. Sure, you'll last longer, but that canister will run out eventually and you're done.",Simplifying Law DD series part II - NSCC rules relating to their 'watchlist' and margin,1.0,1615764254,Leaglese

Disclaimer:  There's no specific stock advice or DD here. Literally just an idea as  my brain grew it's first wrinkle today and I want to practice the thing those wrinkle brain guys do... th.... thoughting? I want to practice thoughting. Please thought with me and say me if my thought good please.

GME was just the first in what I believe will be a series of events that lead to a society with further decentralized financial activity.

Yes,  I know that that-which-shall-not-be-named was probably the first big step to financial decentralization, but it never felt as real as the GME story.  It happened too slowly and quietly, even though it is just as real.

The change in the way information is spread as well as the ubiquity of technology will, I believe, change the world's supply and demand. The average person's demands will be heard much louder. Supply chains will also improve. We're already at a point where I can just ask a question on the internet with a decent chance somebody has the answer. That answer can influence my security purchase decisions.

To expand on that, if access to resources becomes quicker and easier, soon all we'll need is the right information and probably minimal cash to obtain whatever resources we want.

It's like when you play Zelda: Breath of the Wild and you could either pay  600 rupees for the Flamebreaker armor, or you can catch 10 Fireproof  Lizards and give them to the guy for the armor. Generally, that's going to be easier than obtaining an extra 600 rupees. But, the only reason that becomes an option is because we KNOW it's an option. I believe  these options lie everywhere in real life, we just don't know about them yet. Learn to build your own armor and you don't need to pay for it.

Maybe we all know this, which is why people like to buy decentralization-oriented investments and keep living on the internet. But I think the most practical application would be to invest in things we LIKE, because if money does become more decentralized, the public can use it as a tool to fund whatever they like. AKA crowdsourcing. We literally crowdsourced  GME.

Soon there's going to be a  ton of crowdsourced stocks. Hedge funds aren't going to be fighting us on it anymore; they'll just see it as another factor to account for when making investment decisions. We're already seeing it with the other meme stocks, but I think it will be more based on what we like and less based on pure mob mentality. I think this is a likely future of our market.",Idea: Decentralization of finance,1.0,1615764527,permanentburner89

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&amp;D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece. 

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&amp;D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

I wanted to share my DD on a company I am very bullish on $HIMS. An incoming catalyst in the form of year end 2020 earnings is set to be announced 3/18. This was trading in the 20s in February. 

  
**About the company**

  
Hims &amp; Hers Health is a is a fast growing telehealth and mail order wellness product provider. The company launched in 2017 targeting the male consumer hair regrowth and erectile dysfunction markets (my wife‚Äôs BF sometimes needs a little help \*wink wink\*) A few months later, Hers, their female health company was launched offering birth control, skin care, and hair care products.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Analysis**   
Below are some key financial takeaways and indicators. HIMS has done a great job at retaining customers while also managing its cost to acquire them (see next section)  


* Estimated 128% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2020
* 91% recurring revenue
* 71% gross margins
* Over 2 million cumulative consultations
* More than 250,000 customer subscriptions
* Sales increase expectations are 66% increase to 138 million for 2020

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

  
In subscription based business models, acquiring customers is an extremely costly aspect. In 2019, HIMS spent over 150 million on CAC. Through the first 2 quarters of 2020 they only spend 17 million (graph below). Keeping the same trajectory for year end 2020 would result in a 75% decrease.

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down.
