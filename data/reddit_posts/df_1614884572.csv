48,lxsju3,"Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc., is a supermarket chain headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, US. The grocer offers a wide selection of natural and organic foods. This is also an ecommerce play similar to whole foods with amazon as you can order online for pick up/get your groceries delivered.

[https://www.sprouts.com/](https://www.sprouts.com/)

There is a trend that people are leaning towards more natural and organic/healthy lifestyles so i expect this chain to continue to grow. Consumers are eating more organic food and using more organic products than ever before, according to the 2020 Organic Industry Survey released by the Organic Trade Association.

Sprouts has locations in 23 states currently and is still expanding with more locations. California alone has 128 sprouts markets. I dont even have one in my area but i wish i did!

The company posted earnings on feb 25th and reported net income of $287 million and adjusted net income(1) of $294 million; compared to net income and adjusted net income of $150 million from 2019. A 96% increase in sales. They had a 340% increase in ecommerce sales as well. That smells like growth to me.

They raised earnings per share guidance to $1.78-1.91 for the period, compared to the Thomson Reuters consensus earnings per share estimate of $1.75.

Additionally, they posted news today of $300 million share repurchasing authorization.

[http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/04/2187241/0/en/Sprouts-Farmers-Market-Announces-300-Million-Share-Repurchase-Authorization.html](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/04/2187241/0/en/Sprouts-Farmers-Market-Announces-300-Million-Share-Repurchase-Authorization.html)

Our new share repurchase program reflects our commitment to strong cash flow generation and driving shareholder return, while at the same time deploying capital to drive growth over the long term,” said Denise Paulonis, Chief Financial Officer. “This repurchase program demonstrates the Board's confidence in our future and the company’s strategy.”

They have a little over 100 million shares outstanding so this share buyback will be beneficial to the company overall.

They have close to 100% institutional ownership as well.

This is a value buy.
