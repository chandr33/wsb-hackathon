I don't even know how Reddit works. I've got a friend who tells me I'm crazy for being a part of this. But I've been through a whole host of crazy market events:

* *Dotcom crash*
* *9/11 crash*
* *housing crash*
* *COVID crash*
* *and now, the Gamestop short squeeze*

Financially, I've made out well in every scenario for being a contrarian (financially disciplined and often betting on the long term upside during short term catastrophes). Here I am, again taking a positive position with contrarians. This time against the notion that Gamestop as a company is done. Against the notion that it should be shorted into oblivion by the Hedgehogs. Against the notion that ""smart money"", that those with immense financial resources, always win. Against the notion that the system is rigged against the retail investor, from the days E\*TRADE was airing ads of the retail investor throwing bricks through bulge bracket firms' windows (cannot find a link to this commercial) to the days that RobinHood made a similar marketing promise.

**What We're Up Against**

It's hard to imagine the scale of the money involved, so I'll give a hypothetical example. For a sense of scale, if I had 10 billion dollars on one side of a stock trade, and the slippery morals, I could put out $1,000,000 contracts to have FIVE THOUSAND GME apes assassinated, and still come out with $5B remaining. If you have doubt about short ladders, media manipulation, character assassination, brokerages restricting trades, or LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE being possible, I hope my example illustrates what else is possible with that much money.

**Wisdom and Typical Behavior**

Having been through all of the above, I know that people in power do EVERYTHING they can do to maintain it, legal or no, ethically shady or no. And--to their advantage generally--the mob is like a flock of birds, each following the tail feathers of the one in front of it. Sometimes people in power harness this truth about groups of people, sometimes they attack it. We've seen a little of both in this situation. But what's unique here is that there are many birds in this flock that fly North in the springtime because they have a strong Reason to.

**Fundamentals of the Company vs Fundamentals of the Market**

I may not understand the intricacies of the market, I may not know all the factors that tie a share of a company to the fundamentals of the company. For the most part, I agree with Mark Cuban that they are these days much divorced.

But...I do know how supply and demand works: people who buy GME and hold own the supply, people who shorted the stock are saddled with their chosen demand. That's a fundamental of the market that was exposed by this movement, and its effect is undeniable.

**The Trade**

When I read about WSB buying GME and others because the meme was funny, the nostalgia was real, and the short squeeze was possible, it appealed to me. I took a 5% percentage of my portfolio and moved it into GME, AMC, and BB (in that order in percentage, and I've consolidated those positions into GME fully since in order to focus). I categorized the trade mentally as a ""do or die"", that is it either moons or flatlines (binary trade). Thus, at the onset my goal was set.

**This is the Way**

I had a gut check when GME went over $400, because like many others, it was a huge return. I also had one when the price sunk to $40. But I didn't sell out, because that wasn't my reason for the trade in the first place. In fact, I'm pretty proud to say that I bought on the trip down, increasing the amount of shares bought all the way down to low 50s.  My position relative to my portfolio TRIPLED from 5% to 15%.  As a do or die trade, I will hold it long after the memes stop coming, the nostalgia wanes, and hopes of a short squeeze fade...or until my patience allows me to watch it moon.

Why can I hold rather than ""cut my losses""? Because it was a binary trade from the get go. There was no loss limit. I'm financially disciplined and that's the decision I made at the onset when I chose to do it the diamond hands way, the autist with retard strength way.

**My Reason**

And while it's funny AF to be a part of this history (I bought shirts for my fiancee and her boyfriend, and I contributed to the commercial GoFundMe, and now I've even dusted off my Reddit account to get enough Karma to attempt a post on WSB), there's a deep source of my retard strength: Reason. No, not reason as in it is reasonable. Quite the opposite. I'm stubbornly unreasonable.

My Reason is that I bought in because I've also seen a lot of vampirism of the ultra wealthy on those who get by. I witness the parasites of Wallstreet hoover trillions during the aforementioned market events while the rest of us paid for it. I've seen student debt requirements and interest rates rise drastically all the while. I've seen the media bought and paid for and weaponized against us a hundred times over. I've seen money change hands for a pandemic relief that didn't relieve those truly in need of it. I've seen countless efforts by regular people to take away the controlling levers the ultra powerful use to prey on them squashed. Over and over and over again. I've said, ""It's not right, but it's the way of the world"" and, ""If you cannot beat them, join them"" tens of times if not hundreds. Be the world as it may, when something isn't right, you call it out for what it is. And sometimes, when you can, you devote a bit of your own small share of power to it. That's my Reason.

**I Hold.**

Don't waste your ""concern for me"", don't try to tell me about the ""next Reddit trade"", don't try to tell me that I should ""wait on a whale"" (news flash:  this whole thing is happening because...Retail.  Is.  The.  Whale.), or try to tell me about any of the other misinformation campaigns out there. Ultimately since the strength of the GME short squeeze relies on people holding, efforts by bots or shills--it makes no difference--to get those holding to sell are in essence advocating for the other side of the trade. Moon or die, I won't be on that side of this trade.

**""I HOLD."" -- me, every damn day since this started.**

In fact, I bought more yesterday during the dip.

***TL;DR: I went into the trade with eyes wide open as a high risk, high reward trade. I usually don't take on these ""bets"", but this one resonated with me because of the vast amount of class injustice I've witnessed in my life. Doesn't sit right with me to either sit on the opposite side of this trade or on the sidelines. So I hold moon or die. Naysayers can GTFO of here.***

Aside from the obvious $424 BILLION dollars in stimmies (hitting today for a lot of people and transferred into brokerage accounts beginning between now and Monday/Tuesday of next week), consider there are other parts that will go into the pockets of the poors as well over the next year:

* Unemployment insurance extensions: $246B
* Tax credits, aid, and child care for families: $219B
* Renters and homeowners: $40B

I'm going to do some tablecloth math here so bull with me. Let's assume the stimmies may trickle into the markets at a higher rate than the secondary categories of benefits. I'm going to give the stimmies a ""penetration rate"" of 4%. That is, 4% of that money will make its way into the stock market. *Of that* 4%, let's say 1% goes towards GeM E. This is a grand total **1/2500** or **0.04%**. In other words, **1/25th** of one percent.

Secondly, for the secondary funds, I'll assume a penetration rate of **1%**. *Of that*, let's say again that **1%** goes towards GeM E. That comes to **1/10000** or **0.01%**. In other words, **1/100th** of one percent.

I think these numbers are reasonable, based on my gut. That's it. Adjust upwards or downwards based on your gut, actual numbers of retail moving into the market after the first two stimmy checks, or whatever actual evidence-based you like.

Another big factor which may affect the penetration rate is UNCERTAINTY, which is created among other things by price movement in GeM E and negative media sentiment. Of course GeM E veterans know the crux is about owning the float, but normies and newbies look at volatility as a reason to be scared and maybe not throw some extra play money into GeM E for ""the hell of it.""

So let's do the math:

$424B \* 0.0004 = $169,600,000

($246B + $219B + $40B) \* 0.0001 = $50,500,000

$169,600,000 + $50,500,000 = $220,100,000 of new money into GeM E

This is one of many reasons why the Hedgehogs are doing their best to keep the momentum that was building into last week at bay. Here are how many GeM E shares $220,100,000 will buy at different stonk price points:

* $300: 733,666 stonks
* $250: 880,400 stonks
* $200 (roughly current price): 1,100,500 stonks
* $150: 1,467,333 stonks
* $100: 2,201,000 stonks
* $50: 4,402,000 stonks

I feel like at a lower price there will have been some downward momentum that may scare away purchasing to some degree while MORE shares may be purchased due to lower price.  If price is moving up then there may be more momentum causing purchasing but with lower purchasing power.  Ultimately, my napkin math says there will be \~1M shares purchased from stimmies, and more over the course of a year from liberated finances from the secondary funds.

Obviously, that kind of upward pressure on a stock that has a published float of 54M shares (when you take diamond hander's shares out of the float, you are talking even less shares), that has the potential to seriously move the needle.

\----------------

**TL; DR: The American Rescue Plan will create significant upward pressure on GeM E. Probably more than most consider. I'm guestimating about 1M shares will be purchased, regardless of price point/momentum.**
