Ok so I've outlined a majority of things in my DDs, ranging from what the new rules mean, the margin and the matrix etc (please go back and read my previous DD if you think I'm not making sense). 

In this DD, I'm setting out what I think they all might mean for this trading week, as we all know it's a biggie. Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.

A lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.

So this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. 

Further, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short members as time progresses. 

I'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 1**
So first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. 

Remember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. 

Therefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.

This in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 2**
The new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.

Edit: Oh Citadel is issuing bonds for money are they? I wonder why....

This alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.

As we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.

_______________________________________________________

**Catalyst 3**
If the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.

This means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.

This is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. 

Which in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?

_______________________________________________________

**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**

This is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. 

Sorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go 🚀.

Therefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.

TLDR: The current and new NSCC rules represent a vicious cycle which could force short positions to default, which in turn, allows the NSCC and co to step in a close out their positions

35,m5v6hs,"Ok, so this is just some retarded ape rambling, but hear me out and make your own assessment on these thoughts. We all know GME is a battleground stock. Apes are fighting for bananas, and hedge funds keep trying to steal said bananas. We all know that the massive drops we saw last week, and again today were manipulation pure and simple. 

With this line of thought that these drops were artificial I seriously think their line of thought is to nuke the price as low as possible today, and then short it on all the upticks tomorrow to keep the price as low as possible when people start pumping stimmy money in. Wednesday could probably be a rinse and repeat, drop a nuke, get on ssr, short on upticks Thursday to try and keep the price as low as possible so high options calls are otm for any GME catalysts coming towards end of week.

 I realize they can normally short on both price movements up and down when the stock is not on SSR. But I'm looking at it like fighting a war on two fronts. Much easier to do this tactic, demoralize the opposing army, and make them fight a one way battle on your terms. We apes are a collective front. You know apes are not selling, so you need do something drastic to change the dynamic of the battle. 

If they can manipulate the stock, and keep dropping bombs on it, eventually people will give up. If you are a hedge fund who is losing your ass to a bunch of dumb apes, you would want to make this stock look as unattractive as possible to trick people into selling. This is especially true during a week where there could be an influx of buying. 

Finally, my last point is about the price targets each time we have witnessed a bomb drop? Notice how every time we creep into that 280 - 300+ range, they nuke the stock? I'm guessing that +300 dollar plus range is danger zone / margin call area for all of these shorts. Realistically, a hedge fund should be profiting from both increases and decreases in a stock price. So why try so hard to nuke the price and demoralize all of us by making the price drastically drop?

54,m5vnas,"Listen up fellow smooth-brained apes. I get it, ending the day in the red sucks. It can also take an emotional toll if you allow. But there is something about GME pricing that I've seen a few people mention but not go into depth explaining. And it's pretty freaking important to understand:

First: **The value of currency, goods, or services is only worth the value YOU place upon it.** If that's not ape enough for you: banana worth whatever ape want.

Repeat the above a few times and let it sink in. This is not an oversimplification, it's a fundamental of economics.

Everyone is conditioned from the time they are a baby ape to trust what they are told something costs. Ever since you got your first allowance (if you were lucky) so you could ""learn the value of money"" you've been conditioned to think a good or service is worth what other people tell you.

Think about it: You go to the store to buy a pack of gum ""That'll be $1"", and you say ""Okay, if you say so"". Or as an ape, you go to the store to buy a banana ""That'll be $1"", and you grunt ""Banana good"". Rinse and repeat for the majority of things apes buy without question.

Over time, apes will start assigning intrinsic value to currency based on the pricing they see over and over for goods and services. This is why uncool boomers complain all the time about how a soda cost 5 cents back in their day. People become conditioned to expect X costs $Y.

### That's deep, but what does this have to do with stocks?

As some wrinkly brained apes get smarter, they may not take everything at face value and instead shop around for sellers with a better deal on that Banana. Basically, finding someone who assigned the same value to the good or service as them. When and if that occurs, they are both happy and willing to conduct the trade. It goes both ways, if you have a banana to sell you want to find the ape willing to pay the most. In the most simple sense, this is ""tHE MaRkET"".

Buyers and sellers are continuously trying to find each other in the market. But driving around in apemobiles across the country to find the perfect match is a pain in the ass. This is where marketplaces come into the picture.

A marketplace is a venue (physical or virtual) that serves to connect buyers with sellers. It's a great racket to be in, as those who operate the marketplace typically take a cut of every trade. Sound familiar? eBay? Amazon? NYSE? Because for most apes, it's worth not driving around to find the best price on 1 banana.

### I already know what is a marketplace!

Maybe so, but let me connect the dots.

The purpose of the marketplace is to match apes __willing__ to trade at the __same price__. In stock market terms this is ""bid"" and ""ask"" prices. So if one ape is willing to buy a banana for $1, and another ape is willing to buy a banana for $1, and that's the best price for both, a marketplace like NYSE matches them up automatically to conduct the trade.

Let's take a theoretical case of a stock that has only 1 share, 1 buyer, and 1 seller. If the buyer enters a limit order of $100, and the seller enters a limit order of $200 - no trade will occur. Those orders will just sit there and do nothing. In stock market terms this is trade volume, and in this case it's a big fat zero every minute of trading hours.

What if both apes had set their limit buy/sell orders for $150? The marketplace (NYSE) sees ""Hey, these two apes agree on a price, let me just conduct that trade for you."" This happens in a split second given computers are continuously looking at the backlog of buyers and sellers waiting to match. This backlog is also known as Market Depth, or Level 2 trading information.

(Bonus brain wrinkle: If either ape had set a market order instead of a limit order, the NYSE would automatically conduct trade at whatever price the other ape set. This is why market orders are probably not what most apes want to do. You never know who else might show up with a price you don't agree with.)

### Come on already, what is your point?

Now that everyone reading this should have the same understanding of the marketplace (NYSE) at this point, let's discuss how volume has an impact.

In the example above I use 1 buyer and 1 seller. Once their trade executed, it was a volume of one. If both buyer and seller had their limits set to $150, the NYSE would reflect a stock price of $150. Simple enough, right?

But what if there were 10 buyers, 9 of which were diamond-handed apes, but 1 of those sellers was a hedgehog friendly to the seller? We already know the 9 apes value their shares at $1M and are not __willing__ to sell for the __same price__ that the seller is asking. Let's say the NYSE shows the last trade price as $420k. All it takes is for that one hedgehog to put in an order for $100 and BAM! NYSE then shows the last trade price as $100, not the $1M that the 9 other apes value the stock to be.

""Preposterous! Market manipulation!"" the apes scream, as they start throwing shit around their cages. Unfortunately as a result, 1 of those apes may become paper hands after their primitive visual cortex lights up seeing $100 on NYSE and triggers a prehistoric behavior that says ""banana worth what other ape tell me it worth"" and starts mashing the sell button.

Well good job you stupid ape. You let 1 hedgehog tell you what you think your share is worth, and therefore made it a reality. Ignoring the 9 other apes that think it's worth $1M. You’ve been conditioned your whole life to let a sticker price tell you what something is worth and haven’t evolved. Pathetic.

### So the last trade price on NYSE isn't really what the stock is worth?

No. Whether it be 10 apes or 10 million apes, NYSE is not going to reflect what the other apes value the shares to be. The last trade price is exactly that, the __last trade__. This is why trade volume is so important, anything less than 1M volume can easily affect the last trade price. But that's not the value of the shares! Repeat with me: ""The last trade price is not the value of the shares!""

### TLDR;

* The HFs know that apes are conditioned to think money has value.
* Share prices don’t reflect what people think it’s worth, they only reflect the __last trade__.
* The HFs also know they can easily manipulate the __last trade__ price on low volume.
* The HFs are screwed as long as apes don't let NYSE ticker tell them what they should value the shares to be.

Anyway, go bury some cash in the middle of nowhere and then come back for it in a few months. Maybe wash your pants with a pocket full of cash and check the wash machine next year.

**TL;DR Struggle Brings Strength.**
