2,lwunuu,"tl;dr: 300%+ upside potential, low cost of entry for retail, currently on sale trading in the $3-4 range \~ Transocean ($RIG)

\+Earnings are trending up - potentially positive EPS this year is not impossible and would blow out all expectations. 

\+Transocean has newly patented HALO GUARD technology and will install it on multiple rigs; they have already tested the technology on one Gulf of Mexico rig with a proven positive impact on their operations.

&gt;As evidence of our dedication to innovation, we recently announced our patented Halo Guard technology's successful deployment on the Gulf of Mexico's Deepwater Conqueror. Halo Guard works through a combination of locating device technologies worn by personnel on the drill floor and a machine vision system using leading-edge techniques and machine learning and perception.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a crew member moves around the drill floor, the technology locates, tracks and alerts the individual to equipment moving in their area and can halt moving equipment, further enhancing the safety of our crew members and overall operations.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ability for drilling equipment to identify and respond without human prompting is something we have not seen before. We are pleased to provide our crews with additional tools and resources to complement our industry-leading training and safety programs.  
&gt;  
&gt;This technology adds a layer of protection for our crews, and we believe other industry participants and potentially other industries will also want to consider incorporating this technology into their operations going forward. We are currently planning to install this technology on six additional floaters this year.

\+Transocean has plenty of cash and a backlog of contracts to keep them sustainable well into the future. 

\+Oil prices still have plenty of room to run up with reopening plans - stimulus checks and vaccines are coming. 

\+The Biden administration is unlikely to be approving new pipelines that could have offset the increased demand. 

\+Very undervalued compared to historical, currently market correcting with plenty of room on the upside.

\+The reorganization of debt triggered hedge funds to push them into default. There was a court proceeding that dragged on, and the stock went down to $0.65 but eventually ruled favorably for Transocean.

\+HF was likely long the debt, short the stock, and had CDS if they could win the lawsuit.

\+The downward pressure from the shorting coupled with the lawsuit held the stock low.

\+RIG won the suit, and they were not in default.

\+Bankruptcy was priced in for $RIG; it fell as low as $0.65 from $7-14, but the market was wrong, and Bankruptcy is no longer in the forecast as they have stabilized cash flow and have reorganized their debt, pushing it out over a longer time horizon. 

\+HF may be trying to appeal the suit.

\+Transocean is THE LARGEST offshore drilling rig contractor in the world.

\+Transocean has a favorable deepwater rig count and a lack of competitors.

\+Transocean is currently delivering its best overall operational performance in its history.

\+2020 recordable incident rate was 0.24, the 2nd lowest in the history of the company, with 0 lost time incidents

\+Currently delivering 97% uptime on its global fleet, which is the highest in their history, on their most challenging fleet of floaters (ultra-deepwater and harsh environment)

\+Handling of COVID-19 was phenomenal - seamlessly transitioned teams into remote

\+Backlog is @ 7.8B, which will be converted to revenue and ultimately cash

\+New contracts are being secured in Norway starting in Q2 through EOY.

\+Other contracts in Norway extended through EOY.

\+UK contracts extended through Q3.

\+Gulf of Mexico contract with BHP option executed as an increased day rate of $215,000/day, extended through the summer.

\+Asgard (their most advanced asset) recently completed its campaign and is being bid for multiple opportunities.

\+Trinidad contract with Shell extended by one well.

\+New Trinidad contract with BHP signed for $220,000-250,000/day, ending August with Options into Fall.

\+Brazil contracts options executed for 680-day and 815-day extensions; rigs will be working through Summer 2023.

\+Indian contract option exercised for 7 wells through Q4 2022.

\+Petronas in Malaysia terminated a contract for Deepwater Nautilus in November 2020, initially set for March 2021. Litigation will likely rule in favor of Transocean.

\+Deepwater Nautilus signed a new contract that starts operations in March.

\+Expected day rates to rise YoY, with High 200ks expected soon and scaling up each year. More substantial earnings than expected are likely.

\+Reflation trade will likely push the price upwards a few dollars",Transocean ($RIG) massive gaping upside potential,0.84,1614780340,Engineer-Muted

**$DD**

I'm just going to write a bunch of stuff to make myself sound legit. Replaced their CEO and CFO last year. They do a ton of business in Asia. Asia is currently on fire. Amurica is about to reopen. It recently merged with IFF (a smells and tastes business that made big tendies). Sales are expanding, consolidation and mergers and shortages in the industry means fatter profits going forward (at least over the short run). It's divested it's slower growing businesses. Debt repayments are basically moved to Q4 2023 after having spun off the shittier business units.

Units it owns now:

\- Transportation &amp; Industrial: They've mentioned EVs and batteries a few times on earnings calls.

\- Electronics &amp; Imaging: Semiconductor materials? Check. American manufacturer? Check.

\- Safety &amp; Construction: What have they done during the pandemic? Tons of PPE sales. What will they do after? Construction.

TLDR: Infrastructure play. Good balance sheet. Stock has been washed out recently. Ticker is $DD. What better ticker?

With that being said, NOT FUCKING EVERYTHING IS A PLOY BY HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU OUT OF GME. This rocket squeeze was created by CEO, the CEO of rocket has done amazing things with the company, and their balance sheet is impressive. He hates shorts as much as we do, so he decided to do something about it by essentially creating a gamma squeeze. Rocket was a really good play, especially with options.
