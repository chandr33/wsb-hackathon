21,mgij08,"Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.

Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.

# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short

Anybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)

13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.

https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a

A lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.

# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand

For most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6db

Gamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.

Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:

1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.
2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.

So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.

# This is not an investment

The stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.

42,mgite3,"First time post, but wanted to bring more attention to a biotech stock that I personally love.

ABCL is not a biotech company, nor is it a pharma company. They want to be both, they want to make data, make drugs, make new scientific discoveries, they want royalties, partnerships, research. This company has huge plans and is in the right spot financially to make it all happen.

Check out their earnings:

ABCL [(Link to Earnings)](https://investors.abcellera.com/news/news-releases/2021/AbCellera-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Business-Results/default.aspx) TLDR its fucking massive, its a phenomenal report. 800 million on hand with Little debt with the debt at 0% interest. *0. F'ing. Percent.*

ABCL has huge potential to become a **massive juggernaut** as a biotech/pharma company.

Their antibody discovery platform allows them to rapidly discover therapeutic targets and push them into preclinical development. This is best demonstrated by the development of Bamlanivimab, where the antibody went from unknown to discovered product to clinical trials in **60 days. 60. days.** Typical drug development takes years on average and they had a covid drug in clinical trials by the summer of 2020 after starting discovery efforts in late winter.

Let me start a new paragraph and reemphasize this shit ***60. F'ing. Days***. Thats the definition of industry disruption, to introduce a new product that drastically improves and decreases development time is huge. I fucking snorted the crayons (orange you tards any other flavor isn't worth the time) out of my nose when I saw this, full disclosure I work in the industry and we can't fucking match this.

And since I know most of you can't read, here's a couple bullet points your partner's girlfriend or boyfriend can read to you tonight:

* ABCL 2020 Annual Revenue was $**233,155,000.**
* ABCL 2021 Q1 Project Revenue from one income stream AKA Bamlamni-60fuckingday-cumfasterthanyourpreeteen-vimab is a minimum of ***190,000,000, more likely over 200mil.***

Their projected 2021 Q1 revenue is essentially their whole entire year in 2020.

Now during the earnings call one investor had a decent slightly stoopid question of what about when COVID is over. Ladies and Gents sit down and shut up. COVID is projected to be endemic for the decade if not forever, it is here to stay. Which means COVID drugs are here to stay and here to generate money. The CEO made sure to point this out, also that ABCL is not a fucking COVID company. They many projects in different fields of therapeutics (oncology, animal health, nerve regeneration, etc) and they acquired a company called Trianni last year. A humanized mouse model company that OTHER companies will use for research and drug development.

&amp;#x200B;

If my retard summaries above weren't enough check out the historical short volume data. If you wanted squeeze potential, ABCL might just have a bunch of lemons so find some fucking sugar, ice cubes, and water. Might just be drinking some lemonade on the porch of your 100 year old dilapidated Southern Style farm house porch  of a home that you bought with 5% interest with a waived inspection and no DIY skills to speak of.

53,mgivmq,"I know there has been a lot of talk recently about OBV, and whether it should be calculated using Extended Hours. So I pulled a small sample from a 4 hour chart to see how it changed and noticed a huge issue with the Extended Hours OBV.

The following is a comparison of the 4 hour OBV Calculation for Extended and Regular Hours from 1/25/21 thru 1/27/21.

&amp;#x200B;

[OBV Extended Hours vs Regular Hours](https://preview.redd.it/9m9prg2ar6q61.jpg?width=763&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee87b510a6f58fe1a729063b5495e174fdbf8826)

Do you notice something unusual? (Hint: I highlighted it in yellow)... That's right, 130 volume on the Extended hours is the inverse of the 130 volume on the Regular Hours for both the 25th and 27th. Why is this? The reason is that the price can change significantly in AH on very little volume. See pic below:

&amp;#x200B;

[OBV Extended vs Regular Hours Pic](https://preview.redd.it/mfvd0robr6q61.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c7b9cbd88e3e2212c16d2a6029cefc80b5411a)

The areas inside the yellow rectangles are the same as the yellow highlights from the above table. Notice in the Extended Hours pic how little volume there is in AH's (the light gray highlights) vs the volume in Reg. Hours (outside of light gray highlights), yet the price can rise significantly in AH.

Due to the AH price rises, it makes it look like the 130 volume is negative when in fact it should be positive. Not only does it make it appear negative, but it duplicates the negative movement (i.e. instead of OBV going up by 97M on 1/25 at 130, it went down 97M... resulting in an understatement of OBV by 194M).

The purpose of this is not to make anyone look bad. I appreciate all of the DD everyone has provided. The purpose is to share a different perspective on how to look at OBV, in my opinion.

If you see a flaw in my analysis, please let me know and I will change it.

eTruck Extra Info \~ 

There are 11.7 million 18 Wheel Trucks working in the world today that get an average 5.5 Miles Per Gallon. eTruck produces the world's first electric/hybrid deisel engine for these trucks and our system gets 14 MPG. This is a game changer in the Trucking Industry. Our chief engineer is one of the top electrical engineers in the world and has worked for many clients including Segway, Audi, Freitliner, and many Federal Govt Agencies.

&amp;#x200B;

The margin for each sale is $25,000 and we currently have 2,000 orders with Memorandum's for Understanding for an additional 30,000 orders.

&amp;#x200B;

The system is patent pending. We also have a great deal of international interest in licensing the technology.

&amp;#x200B;

The best part is that the system is completely adaptable to whatever fuel source is available. Right now we have the infrastructure for Deisel, so that's what we're doing. But later when the infrastructure is there, we can adapt to CNG, propane, hydrogen, etc

&amp;#x200B;

Initially we thought that we would need to raise a great deal of money to jump start production, but we have found that our OEM's (John Deer, Marathon, etc..) have offered us excellent terms for inventory financing and our clients are willing to pay 50% of the cost up front. Currently we are looking to raise $500,000 for operation costs to include a lease on a production facility, production employees, and legal costs for US and international patents. -

The eTruck LOI alone is by far the most intriguing aspect of this under the radar OTC play - as according to eTruck "" The margin for each sale is $25,000 and we currently have 2,000 orders with Memorandum's for Understanding for an additional 30,000 orders."". This alone will mean PSWW is getting a huge first movers advantage in the EV Semis game, and if executed properly and timely will immediately render them a serious player in the EV industry. Considering as of now, Mcap = 9.8M if PSWW can execute on even 50% of its LOIs + begin generating revenue by end of 2021, we are looking for potential valuation of $0.30 - $1.50 PPS by EOY. The micro float will allow for a violent move upward once shorts cover and or impending PR of acquisition is finalized. This company appears to be very similar to $WKHS and could expect a similar run up.

I was just browsing around and looking at all of these blue chips tapering off on a little dip. The market growth since COVID is nuts. I feel like the market is going to average out to back to growth of the last 5 years with a little dip. 

But people are bored so where‚Äôs the money going when all of these people are pulling out. I figured to smaller companies and not the giant like Amazon, Apple, Tesla and shit like that. 

I started looking at pink sheet stuff and have no fear the money has been found. Specially BMW. It‚Äôs moving pretty fast and consistent. I put a 10 share limit at 34.00 and now I‚Äôm hoping a small drop hits. Got a be a pretty fun position to watch. And plus...............
