Read between the lines - excerpt from the article:

VW is planning something called Power Day scheduled for March 15 at 1  p.m. Central European Time, which is 7 a.m. ET here in the States. 

 When it comes to battery development, however, VW has kept mostly silent  over the past year. One clue could be VW's collaboration with  QuantumScape, a California-based battery tech developer that recently  announced its [solid-state battery](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35367888/the-eternal-promise-of-solid-state-batteries/)  design will be ready for mass production in 2024. It's also promising a  much greater energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion  batteries currently found in EVs, among other distinct advantages. 

 VW's Power Day could spell out just when we could see  solid-state battery technology in its cars. It has already dropped a  hint in that direction with Project Trinity's promise to offer ""new  standards in range, charging speed, and digitalization."" We'll have to  wait a few days to find out whether this mean Project Trinity will see  solid-state batteries in 2026 or advanced lithium-ion tech.","QuantumScape (QS) and Volkswagen (VW) Connection : VW POWERDAY, MONDAY, MARCH 15.",1.0,1615492708,Punjabangadagada

16,m2zanx,"I keep seeing people comment how the shorts are bleeding, that we are making them pay by holding blah blah.
What the majority of people are forgetting is that low borrow fees are fucking pennies to the hedge funds and they are not taking it on the chin like you may think. For example a 2% borrow fee on 1mm shares @ $100 per share equates to (100mm * 0.02) / 365 = 5479.45 per day. So someone gets 100mm in cash and then only pays out a fraction of that in interest. 
Even taking gme’s total market cap, ~18bb, 
With current borrow fees only equates to $986,301

Let that sink in for a moment. Even if all the shares of gme are being shorted( they are ) short sellers are only paying a measly 1mm in aggregate to maintain their position. Only when gme becomes hard to borrow and the borrow fee climbs into double digits does it really add some pressure to close the positions as liquidity dries up and opens large price swings presenting much greater risk of short sellers being unable to close. 

This is why we saw the insanely high borrow fees in January. So until liquidity dries up in gme shorts will not be “bleeding” cash, more like a few drops of blood.

57,m2zhr5,"Dear All,

Spent lots of time analyzing the microstructure of what is happening in GameStop and while Redditors where for a small part the enablers of the January short squeeze, they are today being played.

Played by the exact people « Occupy GameStop » think they are hurting. When all this end, as it will one day, redditors will have experienced the biggest aggregate retail loss in history while large entities make a killing by criminally manipulating GME stock price.

The passivity of the SEC is puzzling. How on earth can they allow large entities buying large amount of stocks before engineering gamma squeezes by buying calls so out of the money and so close to expiry that there are zero chance that they will finish in the money while at the same time « boting » retail investors on their favorite social media platform?

The end result of all this will be, unless the SEC wakes up:

- markets manipulators bankrupting a whole generation of new était investors
- disappearance of the « good » short-sellers which have historically kept in check and made it harder for criminals to defraud investors.

So in the end those who will profit most will be precisely those « Occupy GME » wanted to hurt.

Ironic? Maybe

Sad and depressing ? Definitely

92,m2zmd8,"I've seen a lot of negativity today about the lack of gains today and the big sell off yesterday. GME was at $48 on 2/24, it's now around $260. As much as we would love to see it, we're not gonna see gains of 30-40% every day. It's costing the hedgies millions each day in short interest, all we've gotta do to keep fucking them is to keep holding. 3/12 calls that are ITM will be exercised tomorrow, just have patience. Eat some crayons, sniff some glue, jerk off while watching your wife get fucked by her BF, just make sure you HODL",To combat the negativity: GME is up 441% since 2/24,1.0,1615493661,Dizak55
