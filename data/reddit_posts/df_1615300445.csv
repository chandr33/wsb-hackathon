I am not a financial advisor, I literally cannot put pants on in the morning without help, do your own research

I am going to be discussing a specific person by name, please do not witchhunt and harass them, they are an innocent boomer that runs boomer businesses and have done nothing to warrant harrassment.

Fellow apes, I have a bit of information to share with you about about everyones favorite stock, and a headline to look out for in the next few weeks regarding the current CEO.

The current CEO of GameStop is a man named George Sherman, *an old school executive that specializes in Brick and Mortar/retail locations*

I pointed this out in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx2n82/draining_the_swamp_gme_notable_hires/gpl0k8k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3), but I feel like everyone needs to realize that THE CURRENT CEO IS GOING TO ABSOLUTELY BE REPLACED (most definitely with Cohen).  If you had any doubts in your mind this was happening, here's some info you might like to know:

Before becoming the CEO of GameStop, Sherman was an executive at [several retail stores such as Target, Victra, and Best Buy](https://venturebeat-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/gamestop-new-ceo/amp/?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16152987008819&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2019%2F03%2F21%2Fgamestop-new-ceo%2F).  Sherman is someone that has served his entire executive career running physical stores.  *The polar opposite of GMEs future as an E-Commerce giant*.

On top of this, George Sherman served as Victras CEO (a brick and mortar Verizon phone retailer) for a rather short time frame of around ~5 years.  I don't know the guy personally, and I'm not part of Victras upper management, but I can make an educated guess that someone constantly shuffling around executive positions and not lasting very long at all of them is a sign of someone that's not easy to work with, and a sign of someone that probably isn't best suited as an executive for a company in the midst of a huge e-commerce pivot.

As we saw before when Cohen was essentially elected as the shadow CEO, GMEs share value absolutely exploded over this good news, just imagine when it becomes official 

Ryan Cohen is draining the fucking swamp one by one, we already saw the huge momentum caused by ousting the old CFO, hes unofficially taking the reigns as CEO currently and I can only imagine it will be equally huge news when it's 100% official 

THE CURRENT GAMESTOP CEO IS A BOOMER THAT RUNS BOOMER STORES, ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE GOES, THIS HEADLINE IS GOING TO BE INSANE 🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr CEO go bye-bye, GME go 🚀🚀🚀

Tl;Dr at end.

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

&gt;Thanks for the kind words.

&gt;If there is any movement formed to take on illegal naked shorting, I would be happy to contribute. I have been consistently frustrated in trying to get media or politicians interested.

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**",A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in the Stock Market,1.0,1615301252,Tepllhcgftwhdg
