6,m6lzqt,"Shorting is roughly 20% of volume, and has been for weeks.  Shares to lend have been nearly non-existent for weeks.  Only 4.6 million shares short covered this week.  Daily utilization is nearly 100% of float.  Reported SI is 44% but is that possible?

They are shorting 7mm shares daily.  14 million so far this week, not counting prior weeks where they were forcing sideways movement/decreases by shorting...

These hedge players I read recently have been fined 58 times for violations which include under reporting shares shorted.  IOW, they will lie about their short position, and count the fine as cost of doing business.

Going through short volume numbers by week since 1/14 through 3/15 provides some interesting insight.  We know our starting point was 140% short interest.

Total long volume since 1/14 is 764603691 shares

Total (reported) short volume is 743764136 shares

Now if we take the absurd position that EVERY long share sold was to cover a short...  I know it's impossible but just play along...

Taking that position, we see that 20839555 shares short were covered.

GME's float is 45MM shares.  140% SI would be  63MM shares short.

So using the numbers THEY reported, there would still be 43MM shares short, or 96% SI

WSB has 9MM members.  Even if only 25% of members here own a absurdly conservative estimate of 2 shares, that is  4.5MM shares, or roughly 10% of float.

When we subtract those numbers from the overall long totals and recalculate the previously ridiculously conservative prior estimate the outcome is 106% SI.

However, my gut feeling is WSB probably owns 50-75% of float at this time which means that the actual number of shares short (as reported) actually increased anywhere from 1.6MM to 12.9MM, resulting in actual SI of somewhere around 146% to 169%.

If the HF's are underreporting, then that number could be insanely high.

TLDR:  It's is numerically impossible the SI has decreased from Jan 14th and has actually risen anywhere to 146%-169%.",GME: Proof that hedgies are lying about their shorts coverage.,1.0,1615935951,boopbeepbi

Years ago, in a time when the internet was still a bit new. There was a lady who worked at a modest 9-5pm job, making it by the best she knew how. 
 Influenced by a drive to better herself, she decided to take a risk and started to invest small amounts of her meager paychecks into different markets. She did not let her inexperience at investing hold her back, she began learning what she could about the subject. 
  While studying investments one day she realized a diverse portfolio was more beneficial than a restricted portfolio. She began happily buying into affordable stocks akin to a penny stock. The woman couldn’t afford to pay for financial advisors so she spread her buys out alphabetically. She bought a few stocks beginning with the letter “A”, then bought a few stocks with the letter “B”, and so on... This continued every paycheck for a few years and her portfolio was grew little by little over time, her portfolio wasn’t rich but it wasn’t doing bad either.

 A few years older and later the lady starts thinking about her retirement and how can she save more money for retirement? She lived a humble life and didn’t have much saved. About that same time of the year she gets a letter in the mail from her stock broker company. She figured it was just another monthly balance sheet and she filed it away with the others, no need to look at it because she was invested for the long haul, HOLD’ing before it was cool haha.
 All that week she keeps getting missed calls and messages on her telephone’s answering machine from her stock broker’s company. Suspecting bad news she decides to call them back but she needs to hurry because she’s on her lunch break using the pay phone booth outside the diner she works at.  
 It turns out one of the stocks she bought into had a huge pump. The stock was a new tech like company that allowed people at home to print text on paper using their machines. The name of that company was Xerox and their stock went through the atmosphere past the moon into the outer realms of the solar system! She was rich. Instant retirement. She could afford financial advisors now and they helped her invest her new wealth to make sure she never lost it. 
The woman remained modest and humble at heart, helping others when she could and doing right by people. 

I don’t know her true name or the true details of her story but it’s an older investing story that’s been around since been around. 
If there is a moral to be found here it would be the importance of diversity as opposed to just buying the same 3 stocks every paycheck. I’ve also heard it described as not keeping all your eggs in the same basket? Oh well, it’s a nice story and a little food for thought.",The lady who accidentally knew what she was doing,1.0,1615936473,ShorterThanTallll

## 4. Molson Coors Beverage Company ([NYSE: TAP](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/molson%20coors%20beverage%20co/24545/))

***Value: $6,779,000Percent of Michael Burry’s 13F Portfolio: 3.02%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39***

Michael Burry bought 150,000 new shares of Molson Coors in the fourth quarter, ending the period with a $6.78 million stake in the company.  The beverage company is behind several famous brands like Carling, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian and Staropramen. Molson Coors shares are up 19% over the last 12 months. The company posted weak Q4 results as it increases spending on new products. Last year, the company suspended its dividend, but the management now plans to recommend a resumption in dividend payments in the second half of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can this perpetual ape energy be harnessed? How can this energy be used to feed the short squeeze?**

I propose the first ever reddit-driven ETF, $CUM 🚀💦

Following some quick research, with the DD provided by /u/Oliark

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040115/how-create-your-very-own-etf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040115/how-create-your-very-own-etf.asp)

An enterprising ape could create $CUM, if they were an ape with plenty of bananas to their name, maybe they could afford a marketing budget to spread $CUM all over the world. 🚀💦🌎🌍🌏

*But how does this help the squeeze?*

If hedge funds get margin called as the short squeeze takes place, their holdings in other stocks will be sold off to pay the bill. Obviously, this will reduce the prices of these shares, reducing the overall amount in the pot for $GME holders to 💎🙌 when holding out for the highest possible sell price.

If the creator of $CUM could ascertain the most likely shares to be sold during the margin call, they could create an ETF purely containing these stocks.

*What makes $CUM so potent?*

As I postulate, as the short squeeze occurs and the apes do what apes do 🦍🚀💦💦💦💦💦💦💦, the trading algorithms tracking various subreddits will be absolutely flooded with our $CUM! Trading exchanges will grind to a halt as the floors become stickier and sticker, with more and more AI brains around the world begging to buy in to our $CUMswap.

In theory, this should negate a portion of the impact upon the share prices of those companies held together by our $CUM.

*Why isn't $CUM a hot sticky mess of market manipulation?*

Thank you Louis for the opportunity to answer this question, when I was a young boy in Bulgaria I never dreamed of becoming a lawyer, so I'm drastically unequipped to answer this question.

All I can say is the following:

Did we ask to be tracked? *No*

Are we responsible for the tracking? *No*

Are we responsible for how external parties use the data that they scrape from us? *No*

My idea is to add a bot that auto excludes tickers that are clearly under 1 bln market cap, at least for companies listed in the US.

From a technical point of view I think it can be done. Nasdaq has daily infos on companies market caps. The bot could use them to auto flag posts to ban. The bot could look into the title and the text of posts and determine if it refers to a pennystock.

In order to limit false positives, and to accommodate for daily market fluctuations, the post could be flagged depending on how much under 1 bln the company is.

81,m6mkem,"Bot to auto ban posts referring to under 1 bln mc?

I'm relatively very new here but I can already see how annoying are pennystock posts. So I'm taking advantage of the after hours to throw an idea for the mods. 

My idea is to add a bot that auto excludes tickers that are clearly under 1 bln market cap, at least for companies listed in the US.

From a technical point of view I think it can be done. Nasdaq has daily infos on companies market caps. The bot could use them to auto flag posts to ban. The bot could look into the title and the text of posts and determine if it refers to a pennystock.

In order to limit false positives, and to accommodate for daily market fluctuations, the post could be flagged depending on how much under 1 bln the company is. If it's like 40 mln then it could be a direct ban, while 990 mln could be reviewed by human moderators.",Reerererere,1.0,1615937631,Jahshua159258

**Let me start by stating the obvious:**

This entire post reflects my personal opinion and is in no way financial advice. And for full transparency I also want you to know that I'm holding shares in GME and would financially benefit from any increase in price.

Elliot Wave Theory

*Processing img idm32ufg5hn61...*

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

*Processing video vsm22l8l5hn61...*

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"". Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

*Processing img 1vuhwi4n5hn61...*

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

*Processing img tz9lls9p5hn61...*

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

#  So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

*Processing img 11kyqyv46hn61...*

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

*Processing img ghttkcd76hn61...*

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

*Processing img aehej23b6hn61...*

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

*Processing img jf5g20sc6hn61...*

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.","Apes Read this post by u/ChristianRauchenwald ""Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...""",1.0,1615937649,thepussy27
