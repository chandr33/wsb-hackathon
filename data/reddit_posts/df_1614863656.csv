23,lxkd5o,"For all those as retarded as me, Paperhands Portnoy backed ETF ""BUZZ"" is NOT for those of you looking to cop out on scouring WSB for the next big mover. It's just a bunch of staple tech firms + Portnoy's own ventures. It's being launched on the NYSE today.

Dont get me wrong i like some of the stocks - but don't be like me and assume that this is an attempt to get ahead of the meme curve and predict market movements based on reddit, twitter and youtube ""BUZZ"". 

It's also being pushed by all of the outlets that have nay-sayed the WSB stocks. Cramer and Motley Fool to name just two. Lots of articles circulating with the caviat ""But don't worry there are no failing companies like GameStop included!"". No surprise it contains none of the top mentioned stocks on WSB.

Leaves us the perfect opportunity to start a $WSB ETF managed by u/deepfuckingvalue once we scrape our lambos off the top of our GME profits.

here's the link, but you can find the complete list elsewhere: [https://investorplace.com/2021/03/buzz-etf-the-top-10-holdings-in-dave-portnoys-new-social-media-sentiment-fund/](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/buzz-etf-the-top-10-holdings-in-dave-portnoys-new-social-media-sentiment-fund/)

30,lxkeg0,"I'm not sure why the first post was deleted, maybe because I didn't include puts, and only showed calls(for dramatic effect). Anyway here it is again, with puts Open Interest included.

I've seen a lot of DDs repeating similar assumptions on gamma squeeze/delta hedging without actually providing accurate calculation on it; And it seemed, with the 7 million plus influx of new members to wsb, a large portion of  newcomers don't know the option's greeks yet. ***Thus, the reason for this post is to enable everyone here in wsb, to calculate the gamma squeeze effect for themselves(rough approximation), instead of relying on random DDs figures.***

The attached excel sheet allows you to model squeeze scenarios

[Based on 3\/3\/21 Market Close Data](https://preview.redd.it/rs16fz0ye0l61.jpg?width=1136&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b249586e6852164f6099f0647ef41cb117615)

*^(You'll need to enable macro, needed to run Black Scholes functions, I promise no virii inside)*

So based on  the market close data of 3/3/21, using options data up to the 3/19 expiry, the net delta hedged shares by MMs stands at 6,852,559 \*(\*\*^(If we assume most MMs try to be delta neutral)\*). And if $GME price were  to increase to 200$, they would need to buy an additional 6,261,580 shares

Now suppose you want to see what happens when someone buy 20,000 of 3/12 200 calls. Go the EXPIRY2\_CALLS sheet and edit the Open Interest of the options

check back at the cover sheet, the net buy needed by MMs,

https://preview.redd.it/ole9xl74f0l61.jpg?width=838&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eafbc47275580cb868f25b9b8e7d848c2a786c8

is now 6,825,991 vs 6,261,580 previously, an increase of 564,411 shares. So a call option worth 20,000 x 5.2 x 100 = 10,400,000$, if the stock price increased from 124.8 to 200 (in 1 day) would have triggered an added 564,411 shares delta hedged (rough approximation), which was worth 564,411 x 124.8 = 70,438,492$ if bought outright, giving an amplification factor of roughly 7:1.(^(not using tick data to forecast price increase vs buying volume)) One common misconception is that if a call becomes ITM near expiry, MMs would have already bought &gt;90% of it in delta hedge, however  for a high IV like $GME, its closer to 60%.

[3\/5 120C](https://preview.redd.it/xn5i476cf0l61.jpg?width=1886&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cb48e82c814a9db915a76204fb6b5f2c056f55)

So there you go 🦍 🦍 🦍, with this hopefully you can start  counting 🍌🍌🍌 yourself, instead of relying on reddit randos.

**^(Technical Notes :)**

^(- To update data, download / copy paste options  from Barchart) [^(https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-12-w)](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-12-w)

^(- The macro function  Black-Scholes in the excel sheet provides customizable BSM outputs(price,delta,gamma configurable based on the parameter inputs))

^(- MMs are not legally obliged to be delta neutral, but most of them try to be.)

^(- The standard BSM model is not what is currently used in the industry, but should be accurate enough to +-10%)

^(- If you subscribe to barchart or any other data provider, use data query web to have the options data automatically refreshed by excel)

^(- For tick data to accurately model volume vs price increase try IQFEED)

*EDIT 1 : Assuming of course that most of your counterparty is MM(not closing out trades) and not wsb theta gang or people selling covered puts, I'll put the figure for $GME around 70-90%,*

*EDIT 2 : I've added a simple pct value for people that pointed out, some counterparties would not be MMs, such as  spreads and covered calls/puts. For $GME I estimate the probability of 1 sigma(68%) of net MM would be around 50-80%, and 2 sigma(95%) would be 40-90%. The option data already includes multiple expires up until 3/19, which is the period with the heaviest OI.*
