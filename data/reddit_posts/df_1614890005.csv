1,lxuicg,"BREAKING NEWS!!! ALERT FOR A POTENTIAL GAMMA SQUEEZE.

A spoof article was posted today on Seeking Alpha trying to scare retail investors to paper hand.

Poor Poor Gary Gordon wrote an article for Seeking Alpha **begging** retail investors to sell the stock out of **RKT**! Gary was apologizing in his article and stated that he was wrong about retail investors on the short squeeze.

It's a Very High Probability there could be a Gamma Squeeze as the article mentions that RKT publicly traded stock is only 6% of total shares, the rest are held by the founders of the newly IPO company. **""I believe""** a high percentage of public stocks will be held by COB on Friday for their dividend **tendies**. This will create a liquidity pool issue for MM as the increased amount of Calls that are now ITM which happened through this week will cause an increase in MM purchases to provide the necessary liquidity to cover. With very few retailers that want to sell **""I believe""** there is a high chance of upward volatility Friday afternoon.

Just wait until noon for Friday and if the stock price is close to $30 then the last two hours of trading are going to be very interesting.

TLDR: **""I""** am buying more **RKT** Stonks before COB Friday if it looks like it will close near $30 (Buy at Mid Day) because **""I""** believe a Gamma Squeeze may happen due to increased Calls ITM. The MM is required to buy liquidity to cover the risk of the T+2 settlements for the unexpected increased Calls in the money!!!!

10,lxuj4o,"Fellow tards,

If you’re looking for a way to profit from the popping of this tech bubble you’re gonna wanna go balls deep in $SQQQ. This is 3x inverse exposure so if your risk tolerance is low then go the fuck home and buy some ETF’s. SQ is no where even close to its 52 week high and it’s gonna keep climbing at least until the stimmies are issued and a little life is injected in this market. Yes the economy is fine but the stock market and particularly the tech industry are going to continue to see plenty of red days in the near future. Disclaimer: I’m literally on the spectrum.

Edit: The fact that most of WSB is against this move makes me love it even more. Gonna double down at open tomorrow. Thank you tards but I know this isn’t a long term play I’m riding it into tomorrow afternoon. Unsure if I’ll hold through the weekend yet. 

Currently holding 650 shares

Double edit: sold all shares near the peak at 11:30 am then purchased a bunch of stocks at discounts but the ones I’m most bullish long term are DKNG, TSLA, FUBO, and SNAP. Shorter term I like WFC and PRPL. Also put a bunch into UDOW and gonna monitor SPXL next week for a good entry point. Stay autistic my friends.",$SQQQ,0.71,1614890064,zwalsh54

I’ve been following this for about 8 months and I’m not sure what to think. The Short of it is over the summer this China based coffee company was showing 500% increases in revenue which got the stock to around $50 a share. Turns out there was a lot of fraud involved and the stock was pulled from the dow and now trades in the OTC. Recently they filed bankruptcy in the US but only to protect its assets from being sanctioned more by the US SEC. All operations in China are fully a go with 500 locations still to open and now show actual audited revenues for 40%-50% increases. The stock dropped to about $6 a share. Part of me feels like the bankruptcy gave us a great dip to buy at.",Luckin Coffee (LKNCY) Thoughts?,0.21,1614890667,Tbell8015
