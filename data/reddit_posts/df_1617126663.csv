66,mgmkd1,"TLDR; SEAS is not a 50$ stock. I’m buying puts and thinking about going short for the first time ever.

SeaWorld, ticker $SEAS, is an aquatic theme park that- look, I’m sure you know what the fuck sea world is and the shady shit they do. To sum it up real quick, a documentary was released years ago called Blackfish exposing the abuse and mistreatment of the whales and animals in parks like these. Caused some controversy, but ultimately the company bounces back and people sort of forgot about it (not fucking me).

Fast forward to 2020. Seaworld stock was now sitting at ATH of around $35 a share and COVID suddenly hits. A legendary WSB user known as u/fuzzyblanket notices and decides to buy $SEAS death puts right before it tanked due to covid. Long story short he got rich as fuck and has moved on from us retards now. 

Fast forward AGAIN to 2021. SEAS was sitting at around 30$ and in hopes of a quick recovery from this covid shit (vaccine hopes + short squeeze), investors and mainly institutions drove the price up. And I’m talking wayyy up. From 30$ a share on February 1st, to all time highs of $50 by the end of March.

Keep in mind that SeaWorld has been forced to keep some areas/events closed, and therefore revenue and attendance are down 96% yoy. They have had to add on a significant amount of debt to stay afloat as well, about $225 million, bringing total debt to around 2.2 billion now. Though I believe people may rush into these places after COVID, the damage from losing money for several quarters has been done, and whoever thinks this stock is worth 50$ when everything is not fully open is dreaming. A 70% gain in 2 months is simply unreasonable for a company losing 25 million every month. 

Our boy Fuzzy bought puts when SEAS was 35, I say buy em when it’s 50 now. Volume is low but has been increasing very quickly, the stocks up 4% today somehow. I genuinely think this is a shitty company, both financially and ESPECIALLY morally. I say FREE THE FUCKING WHALE and let’s put this stock into the ground 🐳🐳🐳.",Free the Whale- A short WSB history lesson and why $SEAS is overpriced,1.0,1617128851,BoldOwl11

What we are seeing now is coming true, except that hedge funds are the ones whose over-leveraged recklessness has caused huge sell offs due to margin calls. What is coming is absolutely poetic.
