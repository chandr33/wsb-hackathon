34,lxvvzy,"**Potential flag on the daily chart.**    


For the past month, the market has been in a slump.. FUBO included. Ever since this drop started, the volume on FUBO has been decreasing daily. So where does that leave us?    


If you refer to the daily chart below, we see a clear flag pattern forming. Today's candle served well and gives us trust in the support line of this flag. The long wick on the bottom of recent candle indicates traders buying the dip (hammer).    
Also, take a look at the volume these past few days; high volume with eager bulls behind it waiting for a breakout.    


**I expect consolidation from FUBO between the 30.00 - 44.00 range until a candle opens above or below one of the trend lines.**    


I have made **calculations on a target for the breakout (In red and green text)**. This is only a calculation and gives a rough estimate of where FUBO can possibly end up at in the upcoming weeks/months.     


An **Iron condor** seems to be a solid play as we count the days until this thing breaks out. Wait for confirmation of higher highs from today's candle.    


FUBO is a **volatile** ticker, so keep an eye on it. Moon soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Won't these small spikes as we've seen week of Feb-26 and just Today Week of Mar-5 Help Shorts and couldn't they be engineered by shorts as well ?

The Thing that really helps with running up the option chain is if there are enough options bought and you force delta hedging especially with a stock like GME. If the price is very stable for a period of time (like after the Jan. Squeeze) for a few weeks, then the price of those options drop and a lot of people were able to buy them.

For example, the $115C was something like $1.50 per contract prior to the run-up we had week of Feb-26 and a lot of people were able to profit massively and I'm assuming many used the profits to buy more shares. Good Ape Move.

However, after that spike all the contracts going forward became much more expensive as the premiums and volatility went through the roof. This week, I was able to nag $200C for $1.6 and sold some for $8 which was a blessing but it seems to me, a spike or so every week keeps options prices high and thus prevents retailers from being able to afford call options which seems like a bit of a win for Short Sellers.

Is this logic sound at all? I'm dumb so any advice is helpful. But I had been waiting all week for premiums to drop on call options so I could afford a few that wasn't So out of the money.

If the pattern continues, then leading up to week of Mar-19 and Earnings Mar-26, premiums would get bumped up week after week. Maybe having the price itself stable at incremental steps up week to week far outweighs the options side of things. Thoughts?

Gilead Sciences, of Remdisivir fame, which is still widely being used to help treat Covid (you might have heard of it), has a PDUFA date set for tomorrow for its main product, Yescarta. I believe that if the label expansion approved, there is a huge upside possible, with analysts setting [price targets anywhere from 75 to 100 dollars, an easy 10~40% swing.] (https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GILD/research-ratings) Additionally, [Yahoo also sets growth estimate for the next few months as anywhere from 20.8% to 58.6%.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GILD/analysis?p=GILD) Once the FDA approval goes through, I can see this ticker quickly approaching these levels as quickly as next week.

Let's start by looking at the market caps of other pharma companies. 



Company | MC | Revenue | R to MC
---|---|----|----
JnJ | 401B| 82M| .2
Roche | 281B| 58M| .21
Novartis | 189B| 50M | .26
Merck | 182B | 48M| .26
Pfizer| 191B| 42M| .22
Abbott| 205B| 34M| .17
Amgen| 128B| 25M| .2
AbbVie| 186B| 34M | .18
AstroZeneca| 124B| 26M| .21
Eli Lilly| 192B| 24M| .125
Gilead| 79B| 24M| .3

Just a quick glance tells you that $GILD is massively undervalued. It has a much higher revenue to market cap than any of its competitors, and it's only gonna go up with its recent array of acquisitions, having recently acquired companies such as Kite, and [having just completed the acquisition of MYR Pharmaceuticals, with an approximate 1.45 billion in aggregate cash consideration, as well as Hepcludex® (bulevirtide), which was conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in adults with compensated liver disease in July 2020.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gilead-sciences-completes-acquisition-myr-133900077.html?.tsrc=rss)

Yescarta's label expansion is highly likely to be approved, considering it boasts an impressive [93% rate of response](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/embargoed-asco-gilead-eyes-shot-slow-growing-lymphoma-as-yescarta-posts-big-response-numbers), and the fact that it was given a priority review date, which is only given to drugs that would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications.


Just a month ago, before the correction started hitting, the price of the stock was approaching the low estimates of some price targets, trading damn near 70, but with recent market downturns, the stock is near all time lows, starting trading at 61 dollars at the beginning of the week, and hitting near 65 dollars at the peak today, before coming back down a little bit to 63. While the rest of the market has been bleeding out, $Gild has been making a steady recovery this week, and after the PDUFA tomorrow, I truly believe it will be the catalyst needed to get back into the 70's, if not 80 to 90's. We all know the adage, ~~buy high, sell low~~ buy low, sell high.


Institutions hold a huge portion of $GILD, so you know the MM's believe in the growth potential of this stock. This isn't some high risk meme play hoping for a short squeeze that isn't gonna come. A company has been aggressively expanding, and doing well for itself, it's just slipped under the market's notice.

Still not convinced? Gilead is also a dividend stock with a ridiculous dividend yield of 4.49%. You can easily double dip with this play, watch as the price balloons after the inevitable FDA approval, and even collect a juicy 4.49% dividend on top of your gains on the 12th!","DD on $GILD, seriously undervalued play, possible catalyst tomorrow, the 5th, with a PDUFA date.",0.83,1614893846,O_RRY

&amp;#x200B;

Why TSEM? and not large-cap companies like TSM, UMC, NXPI, MU, etc.

Thursday March 4th, TSEM at $27.51 has a $2.91 Billion market cap. It is a lesser known well run company with bigger potential upside on positive news.

&amp;#x200B;

""We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable.  I’m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.  They’ve authorized the bill, but they need $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity.""

&amp;#x200B;

Will TSEM benefit from executive orders? I don't know. Will there even be executive orders with support and incentives? Can't be sure. 

My idea is simple, maybe too simple, but basically, a relatively small cap company with a global footprint that actually makes the chips and has a great balance sheet could benefit greatly from government incentives and support to address the semiconductor shortage. The lack of semiconductors due to supply chain disruptions is the bottleneck that needs priority in order to support industries affected by the shortage. I believe the government will step in, and that TSEM might have the greatest upside of all the semiconductor manufacturers. 

In conclusion, I like the stock.
