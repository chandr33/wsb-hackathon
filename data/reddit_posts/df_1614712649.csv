Unless you're lost, we all know that RKT did what rockets do... 🚀🚀🚀

So now, both calls are now in the money &amp; if the price finishes above $34 on Friday, they're worth $500 each. I'm a poor peasant so I use RH &amp; we all know they're going to try to fuck me some way before (or more likely I will screw myself over)

So my question, fellow autists, is how do maximize my profits here? I deposited money to exercise the calls I bought, so if that clears in time, I could exercise them.

Is my best option to just hold until Friday and hope the calls I sold are not exercised early?",This ape got lucky. How do I stop RH from fucking me??,1.0,1614713062,BuyHigherSellLower
