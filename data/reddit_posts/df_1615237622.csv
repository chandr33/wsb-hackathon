1,m0q4cq,"Have been looking at $GUSH. Recovery is going on and Oil is starting to get some traction. 

My DD tells me that energy independence under Trump was great and all but it didn't exactly prop up the price of oil compound that with Covid and the Saudi,OPEC/Russia pissing match last year at this time made oil take a vicious beating. Now one year later the global market is more stable with the pandemic starting to recede as vaccines get to more people, Saudi is actually, at least for now limiting production and Biden has thrown all of those pesky regulations back on the domestic oil industry and shut down the Keystone pipeline. Now I understand the green agenda is in place but a real displacement of oil from the world just ain't happening this year and all of those things that Biden is doing in my opinion will return the market to pre Trump conditions which as tough talking on ""Big Oil"" as the Democrats are creates the exact conditions that leads to those same ""Big Oil"" companies making money hand over fist again....Just saying.",Is now the time for a $GUSH er?,1.0,1615237643,Bigtom1974

I just wanted to thank you all from the bottom of my hearts. I had been following this sub for a few months before it got all of its recent traction and I am not afraid to say that GME was the first time I was ever bold enough to invest. Now being the retarded ape that I am I somehow managed to invest at 240 (on the major come down), and subsequently managed to drag my a average price per share down to 179. 

This was over a month ago, and I had to endure the horrendous weeks of everyone telling me how fucking stupid I was for wasting the small amount of money I had on this stupid stock. While I was prepared to lose the money I had invested, I won’t lie, being down 83% felt pretty shit.

Well today, it turned around. For the first time since buying the stock I have closed the day in the green. You guys stuck with it through all of the shit and humiliation and finally we are seeing the rewards we deserve.

My GF and I have been following all of this closely and she agreed to do some DD on it. This is not financial advice. Hope you find it enlightening.

For image 1:

Should I hold, sell, or buy? 

6 of Cups

""if I hold,"" is basically saying that you are holding onto a childhood innocence. Your decision is based in a childlike fun rather than logic, facts, or reason. You're probably returning to a mindset of escape from actual responsibilities and holding the shares in hopes that they pan out and bring you the freedom you had in your youth.

King of Wands

""if I sell,"" you won't regret your decision. Even though you will make the decisive and actionable choice of selling your shares, you'll still enjoy the thrill you received from playing the game, so to speak. You won't necessarily be deciding to opt out in the future, but it feels like the right choice of a leader at this time. Keep watching and consider buying back in if the mood strikes. But use caution, because you might just be giving into feelings of the high of gambling.

The Emperor

For ""if I buy more shares,"" you need to think looooooong and hard about this decision. You are being called for more stability in your life, not added uncertainty. Other people may be watching your decisions here and it would be irresponsible to lead them falsely into poor choices. It's time to set aside fun and games and consider the facts before you.

Seven of Cups (clarifier)

It's saying that you have so many options before you and, because you can see all the options all at once, you are going to struggle to make the right choice. It's good to consider all paths, but be cautious about living in fantasy. There is a right choice here, and you need to think through everything with your feet on the ground or you'll be strayed by your thoughts of whimsy.

Image 2:

Where will the stock be in 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months?

5 of Pentacles

One week, it's going to plummet lower than it has yet.

7 of Cups

One month, anyone's guess. There's too many factors to predict.

Judgement

Six months, it's going to be over. People will lose interest. It's now time to look at what you gained and lost, in terms of your personal growth more than finances. Odds are, you learned a harsh lesson.
