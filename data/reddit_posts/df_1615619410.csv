10,m41ghq,"So you're on RobinBull WeHood and you wanna play options.

These let you trade what's called covered options. You can buy puts and calls.  Let's talk about the long call to start once you figure that out you can just reverse everything and call it a put.

Long calls are types of options which are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon from that seller.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the responsibility to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares. 

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because I'd you buy the right to purchase goev at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15 x 100 in value.  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 15c (A long call for 15 dollars representing the ability to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock for 15 dollars a share expiring on 3/19 costing 5 cents per share) is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.

If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater. 

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy $GOEV at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of so like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  that you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (10,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars) from 50...  But people will buy that form you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares...  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow... Is it very likely that the valuation of $GOEV will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money.. but what about in 2 years... Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..
.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down and sell them when it's up because you get your max benefits like shares... 

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinity loss comes from sue to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb... 

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on goev that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jack those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation. 

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one call for 1 dollar..

This is the real game your playing and how you fit into it my friends...

37,m41pey,"The fact is if we all continue to hold through the dips and the rises we will one day in the next month make some nice cash, the only problem is billionaires don’t like to play by the rules. I don’t see anyone really selling and that last dive on Wednesday with that recovery has given me more confidence in the amount of diamond hands we have than ever, but only time will tell. The way I’m looking at it really is if I lose it all, I’ve lost a small painful amount which don’t get me wrong, it sucks but I’ll survive and get over it. But if it goes the right way it could be life changing to my current situation. I’m almost certain that at least I’ll walk away with enough to pay off all my debts and a bit of pocket money. 

Truth be told, I think GME could really go to plus 5k a share! I’m not sure about the people saying that it could go to 50k I mean on paper it definitely can and should, however I’ll believe that when I see it, there will be some sort of bullshit thing in place to stop something eventually, which would be completely illegal but we are dealing with “elitists”. All those Americans getting their stimulus cheques on Monday will be buying more shares which will drive the price up a bit, which I’m sure will attract a whale or two. Also, we know that a massive chunk of shorts need to be covered by the end of next week which means hedge funders will do everything they can to bring the price down. I’m certain next week will be a bumpy ride but it will be exciting.
