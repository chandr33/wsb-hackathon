# Portfolio Surface Attacks

Sounds like some fancy words huh? Well it's easy. The big picture is that price movements on the whole group of meme stocks might actually be the bigger catalyst for MOASS. Right now a huge squeeze campaign is being waged against GME shorters, but that's not the only way to crush them. Most of these GME shorts are correlated with short positions in the basket of meme stocks and so price movements there still hurt them good. However, some hedgies (mostly smaller ones) are only short in other meme stocks, and not in GME! This means, if a meme stock rises enough and causes some smaller funds to liquidate, causing prices to rise again, it punishes the GME shorts who are still in and could potentially catalyze MOASS as these stocks are all very correlated (look at the Wednesday dip to see)! GME imploding basically means the memes are visiting the moon too. A huge plus is that smaller MKT cap/float for other meme stocks makes them more susceptible to momentum in comparison to GME's sky high prices rn. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Why does this matter?

If you're an average ape waiting to get in on the action and help hate on hedgies, chances are you feel it's too late or risky. These other meme stocks are typically cheaper, undervalued/close to historical prices, and wayyy lower on IV for the options game, which basically means they're lower barrier and lower downside plays with all of the same upside. For all you true autists, there's plenty of quality DD lying around on individual meme stocks to look into, which I encourage you to verify.

41,m5ky3e,"Hey retards! Palantir is recovering from it‚Äôs downtrend, and starting to **breakout to the upside**. $PLTR has gone UP 19.42% from it‚Äôs March 8th low, after benefitting from buying by Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and other institutional players. If you take a look at the attached chart, it has broken through multi-month resistance and pierced the 20-day moving average. Why is it starting to run? Investors are realizing that it has a large and untapped Total Addressable Market (TAM) giving Palantir plenty of upside. 

Palantir operates two major adata-mining platforms, Gotham (for government) and Foundry (for commercial businesses). It **STARTED OUT** for being known for its highly secretive work with the federal government. Helping these high-profile government agencies go digital with their big data was a major tailwind for the company‚Ä¶ but this isn‚Äôt why the stock price will **march to the upside**. The **NEXT MOVE** for the company is helping **commercial businesses** transition to the new artificial intelligence driven digital economy. 

In the era of businesses going virtual, Palantir will play a key role in allowing commercial businesses to process their big data with artificial intelligence, much like it has helped the US government do the same thing. Helping businesses make the best use of their big data assets is largely an untapped market. The Total Addressable Market for the company is $119 billion. This means that at a market penetration of less than 1%, Palantir has **room to go much higher**. Adding to this, the big data market will be worth $229.4 billion by 2025.

I'd pay attention to the following: 

1. Insider's lockup expiration date was February 19th - anyone who was going to sell **has** sold 

2. Chart is exhibiting a **breakout** from a multi-month downtrend and has penetrated the 20SMA 

3. Institutional buying includes Cathie‚Äôs $ARKK. Goldman Sachs **price target is $35**

4. In 4Q, Palantir signed 21 deals worth at least $5m in total contract value, including 12 deals each valued at $10m or more, many with **commercial customers** not government. The company is broadening its market to include commercial clients which represent about 10x their present Total Addressable Market. Revenue growth expected to be 4x in 5 years 

5. Low implied volatility on the options.

6. Many events coming up (DoubleClick Demo Day, Karp/Frost Interview) which will likely act as a catalyst for the stock. 

I‚Äôm long Jun 26c options. **I LIKE THE STONK**

$GME: damn near infinite off $2.57 low 



Now for some DD. Some crossover from [u/Shandowarden](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shandowarden) 


What is Root? 

Root is a car insurance company, but also a data technology SaaS company.  Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. 
There are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https://legiscan.com/OR/text/SB173/id/2236077) See [WA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&amp;Year=2021&amp;Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  

What does this mean? 

 Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. ""Doesn't progressive already do this?"" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.  

Alternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. 

Root has very little debt: $209M

And lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash / investments with its subsidiaries. This cash alone represents roughly 46% of the current ($2.8B) market cap. 

$LMND has a market cap of $6.3B (2/3rds of it's peak 3 months ago).  If $ROOT were to match that market cap of $6.3B (which arguably should be higher), we'd be looking around roughly $25 per share, let alone a short squeeze greater than GME... 

TLDR:  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  ROOT is a tech based insurance company also selling SaaS via data and telematics.  Data is transforming the world, and the insurance industry is incredibly behind.  Data companies such as this one will be here to stay, if not acquired by other insurance companies.  

position: 277 shares @ $11.92, and 10 4/16 $12.50 calls - Will be scooping up 723 more shares next Tuesday, currently capped on RH instant deposit.

So it got me thinking, since HFs host fundraisers for their favorite charities and raise millions of $$ we should do the same. Since we beat them at their trading game we might as well also beat them at their philanthropy game.

Call to Action

Buy GameStop gift certificates and send them to your local Children's Hospital.

Goal $25,000,000  = 500,000  $50 GME gift cards

In Q3 2020 GME had a Net loss of $18.8 million, so $25,000,000 of gift cards will help close the loss gap in Q1 2021.

Why? Even after you purchase a stock, that stock isn‚Äôt in your possession. You simply own, in most cases, an IOU for a stock. It takes literally DAYS (up to 21) before that stock even HAS TO BE DELIVERED to you. Once you hold the stock for a couple of weeks, THEN you actually start putting pressure on others to go out and find those shares to deliver to you.

If you think having more shares through day trading will bring on the squeeze, think again. This isn‚Äôt about ownership. We know that institutions own over 100% of the stock. Retail might as well. This is about having to find the shares, which they don‚Äôt have to do until 21 days after you have purchased. When you day trade, you may temporarily increase the price, but they will then counterfeit more shares to drive it down. Only by holding do you bring them to the activity they fear most - finding the shares.

The sooner we all start holding, the sooner this will happen.

TLDR: Day trading a shorted stock is actually allowing the shorts to kick the can down the road and reducing massive gains later.

Don‚Äôt be a dull idiot. Be an ape.
