5,m04byb,"Idk about everyone else, but I‚Äôm sick and tired of seeing daily conspiracy posts about ‚Äúhedgies‚Äù and ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù whenever a trade turns south. No one is taking any responsibility around here anymore and always needs a boogie man to blame for their mistake. 

Rarely is anyone admitting they gambled, didn‚Äôt do their DD (or only did qualitative research like ‚Äúthis industry will grow‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like this product‚Äù). 9/10 times these threads are embarrassing and scream ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the fuck I‚Äôm doing‚Äù ie ‚Äúwhy is GME trading like AMC?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy is yahoo finance sending out class-action notifications? They‚Äôre manipulating‚Äù!

I‚Äôm gonna tell it like it is:

1.) Stocks have real value. They aren‚Äôt gambling tokens. They afford you ownership of a series of future cash flows. You buy boomer stocks because they‚Äôre boomer companies that are closer to death than birth and they pay a dividend. You buy growth stocks because they‚Äôre closer to birth than death and they‚Äôll one day be boomer stocks when you‚Äôre in your 60s. 

2.) Unfortunately, sometimes everyone spots a Chad and bids him up to maturity as a teenager, leaving some of you buying the guy who peaked in high school on the last day of senior year. If you read the numbers you could have avoided this, but instead you decided you just needed to know ‚ÄúEV will be big someday‚Äù.

3.) Hedge Funds are just as dumb as the smarter among us, but they‚Äôre run by guys with better degrees. You know why Wall Street is so elitist? They don‚Äôt have a fucking clue what‚Äôs going to happen tomorrow and they need to sell their prestige (ie ‚Äútrust me, I went to Wharton and my analysts are from Harvard and Yale‚Äù). You can‚Äôt say hedge funds are these master tricksters when they‚Äôre returns are generally mixed to average at best. Steve Cohen is (allegedly) a known manipulator and the best he could get was 30% avg. that‚Äôs huge, but you‚Äôd expect the biggest (alleged) insider trader ever to be averaging at least 100%.

4.) Trying to cause any kind of ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù isn‚Äôt guaranteed‚Äù or a right, it‚Äôs attempted market manipulation and if it doesn‚Äôt work in your favor, no one will feel sorry for you.

5.) buying shares of bankrupting companies is high risk and it usually doesn‚Äôt work out. Buying a bunch of AMC because you like the movies is stupid. They‚Äôve been declining for years and every studio is running for streaming for a reason. Don‚Äôt cry fowl that you lost money when you bought junk.

6.) We call ourselves ‚Äúdegenerate gamblers‚Äù because we bet on single stocks and options, but we (usually) at least attempt to do DD. Shut up with this ‚Äúsir, this is a casino‚Äù shit. You don‚Äôt go to the blackjack table without knowing the rules and expect to win. We know telling the dealer to hit me with 20 showing is stupid, but we have a hunch there‚Äôs an ACE and we won‚Äôt cry ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù when he flips a King.

7.) Post loss porn, and spend that time learning basic valuation (it applies for growth as well as value) and about the Greeks, instead of researching a conspiracy about how CNBC and Yahoo!Finance stole your life savings you put into fucking Tootsie Roll.

TLDR- Man up and be accountable for your bad decisions instead of pointing fingers at everyone but yourself. DFV does a lot of DD and has conviction and you should too.",When did this sub turn into a whiny version of r/Conspiracy? Sack up and own it when you‚Äôre wrong!,1.0,1615165843,BagofBabbish

15,m04fv4,"The stimmy checks are a big play, we know it and they know it. Here's the thing, it's very likely that they have been planning a strategy around pump/dump for our stimmy. Think about it:

-On one side you have a bunch of apes like myself who just really like the stock. We've been looking at the stimulus check for months. It's important that we don't put the cart ahead of the horse on this one.

-On the other side you have a bunch of greedy overconfident babies. These guys have also been eyeballing OUR stimmy checks and saying ""That 1.9T is better in our pocket than theirs, they don't deserve it because they weren't born into money. They don't deserve these tendies!"" Rest assured, they want these tendies and have been prepping for ways to take them this past several weeks.

So what can we take away from this? Obviously make your own investment choices, but be careful of two things:

1. Be careful of any sudden moves to scare you into losing much of your investment. Be unpredictable in your buying patterns and they won't use them against you. If you're going to invest some of your funds, be prepared for fluctuation.

2. I would not recommend using Margin to pre-empt your own cash purchases. As many apes learned in the past few months, margin calls are a real thing. If there is say a HUGE influx of liquidity (*cough checks*) there could be a huge attempt to go for a counter drop and hit margins hard. Nothing is guaranteed, but it's a slimy strategy to be wary of. One other point about margin, is that margin shares can be borrowed. Cash accounts are the way! Talk to your broker about it.

*TL;DR - Be smart about how and when you utilize any influx in capital you have. The wolf is always at the door. Let's be the wolf, be unpredictable, and be smart about cash &gt; margin. Don't rush, make smart moves and take it one step at a time.

I was hanging around on Yahoo GME call options, with my red pen deep in my nose, shifting from date to date... 

When I‚Äôve just noticed 100K written PUT on 0.5 USD on GME for.... 01/22/2022 e.g. +9 months from now on.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1642723200&amp;guccounter=1

What‚Äôs the purpose of this?

* unmeaningful strike price 
* unmeaningful open interest

Now let‚Äôs consider the impact on underlying stock buy/sell strategy, following a standard delta-neutral strategy from market maker.

The delta of put is negative i.e. the slope is negative. When the stock price gain 1$, the OTM put option premium decreases, let‚Äôs say by 0.5$. 

Buying a put thus gets a -0.5 delta. Conversely, selling a put as a market maker provides a +0.5 delta.

To achieve **delta-neutral** hedging, the market maker thus needs to **sell** stocks.

Can we here have a hidden shorting strategy from hedge funds - along with shorted ETF?

Each option represents 100 shares i.e. thus it represents **10M additional shorted shares** only for this deep OTM cheap put on 01/22/2022.

I've noticed in recent days that there has been much discussion surrounding PLTR about how they are a good buy due to insider selloffs, general  market downtrend, cathy woods, Alex Karps Hair, etc. However there has been little discussion about exactly why their technology is such a big deal, and I believe its mostly due to people not understanding the techno babble on their website combined with not understanding the vague but nice sounding reasons listed by other people that coincidentally, also don't understand why PLTR is a big fucking deal. This is unfortunately expected since the breadth and scale of What PLTR's technologies can do is difficult to put into words, metaphors, or anything simple enough for you monkey shits to understand. 

I however don't give a fuck and so will try anyway. 

Everyone knows already that Palantir does things with data analytics, and  organizes it or presents it in a way that **helps companies make better more informed choices.**  what's then big deal then? don't companies do something similar? 

well yes, but not really. The difference with Palantir is while other companies collect and store data, analyze it, and maybe create software that specializes in something related to it, what Palantir does is they take all that data, they analyze it, maybe make some software,  and uses it to create  (and this is extremely dumbed down) ***a virtual simulation of whatever you are trying to copy****.* Palantir's capable of taking anything you want a simulation of, your network, your logistical systems, financial systems, entire business operations, anything that can be connected with large quantities of data,  and makes a fucking copy on the computer that behaves and reacts like the real thing would. you can test ideas, check for problems, cause problems just to see what happens, and all while constantly changing and evolving in tandem with the real thing. If that isn't already enough, this simulation also is able to proactively suggest solutions to problems that are calculated to have the BEST POSSIBLE RESULT. This in turn, **helps companies make better more informed choices.** you see what I did there? the end conclusion is the same as what everyone else is coming to, but the problem is people aren't getting just how big a deal it is.  

If you dimwit dumbshits still don't get it somehow, consider this.

Imagine if you worked at Melvin and Co. Now imagine you had the power to look into an hourglass that showed you a magical parallel dimension. NAY every possible parallel universe  in which Melvin exists!  and upon this hourglass you asked, ""Mr. hourglass, what would happen if we shorted the FUCK out of gamestop?"" the hourglass would peer into all possible realties, find the ones where GME is short, measure how many became succesful and how many failed, and  would say 

""oof.  hang in there"" 

Thats what PLTR does. (well sort of its hard to explain)

76,m057ab," TL/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

   
 

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

   
 

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting us on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said we weren't just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.

   
 

Well, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

   
 

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

   
 

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.

   
 

NOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

   
 

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

   
 

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

   
 

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

   
 

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

   
 

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.

   
 

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

   
 

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

   
 

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

   
 

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.

   
 

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

   
 

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

   
 

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.

   
 

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

   
 

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.

   
 

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

   
 

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.

   
 

I just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

   
 

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

   
 

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

   
 

THATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.

   
 

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)

   
 

   
 

   


EDIT:

Seriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.

First off, I want it made clear that I have very little knowledge about data analytics and my opinions are my own and you may believe them if you would like.

I've noticed in recent days that there has been much discussion surrounding PLTR about how they are a good buy due to insider selloffs, general market downtrend, Cathy Woods, Alex Karps Hair, etc. However there has been little discussion about exactly why their technology is such a big deal, and I believe its mostly due to people not understanding the techno babble on their website combined with not understanding the vague but nice sounding reasons listed by other people that coincidentally, also don't understand why PLTR is a big fucking deal. This is unfortunately expected since the breadth and scale of What PLTR's technologies can do is difficult to put into words, metaphors, or anything simple enough for you monkey shits to understand.

I however don't give a fuck and so will try anyway.

Everyone knows already that Palantir does things with data analytics, and organizes it or presents it in a way that **helps companies make better more informed choices.** so what's the big deal then? don't other companies do something similar?

well yes, but not really. The difference with Palantir is while other companies collect and store data, analyze it, and maybe create software that specializes in something related to it, what Palantir does is they take all that data, they analyze it, maybe make some software, and uses it to create (and this is extremely dumbed down) ***a virtual simulation of whatever you are trying to copy***. Palantir's capable of taking anything you want a simulation of, your network, your logistical systems, financial systems, entire business operations, anything that can be connected with large quantities of data, and makes a fucking copy on the computer that behaves and reacts like the real thing would. you can test ideas, check for problems, cause problems just to see what happens, and all while constantly changing and evolving in tandem with the real thing. If that isn't already enough, this simulation also is able to proactively suggest solutions to problems that are calculated to have the BEST POSSIBLE RESULT. This in turn, **helps companies make better more informed choices.** you see what I did there? the end conclusion is the same as what everyone else is coming to, but the problem is people aren't getting just how big a deal it is.

If you dimwit dumbshits still don't get it somehow, consider this.

Imagine if you worked at Melvin and Co. Now imagine you had the power to look into an hourglass that showed you a magical parallel dimension. NAY every possible parallel universe in which Melvin exists! and upon this hourglass you asked, ""Mr. hourglass, what would happen if we shorted the FUCK out of GME?"" the hourglass would peer into all possible realties, find the ones where GME is short, measure how many became succesfull and how many failed, and would say

""oof. hang in there""

That's what PLTR does. (well sort of its hard to explain)

Should you throw your entire life savings directly into this bad boy? absolutely fucking not. I'm not your financial adviser/daddy and cannot and will not tell you what to do.

that being said, who's gonna stop you?",What PLTR does explained slightly better.,0.5,1615168879,PickleEater5000

This devalues the dollar (its inflationary). Oil must rise simply due to the dollar inflation created by the stimulus.

Couple the dollar inflation with rising demand due to vaccines (and travel demand returning) and the constrained supply, you have the next bull market in oil for the next decade.
