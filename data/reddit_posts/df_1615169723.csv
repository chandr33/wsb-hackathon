30,m05pg8,"Alright Apes. I've learned a lot thanks to all of you, and I love to grow, so correct me if needed. As I know it, here's the Outline:

1.The Gamma Squeeze = Options (Calls to be specific). When you purchase an Options Contract, you purchase the RIGHT to purchase shares at the strike price. (Only 10% of Options are actually executed,  or ""bought"")

2.When the Options Contract is purchased, the Market Maker / Brokerage has to actually purchase these shares and hold them to be excersized for the contract, even if it isn't excersized. 

3. SI (Short Interest) is thr amount of DAILY interest accrued by Hedgefunds for NOT closing their shorts. (I.E) if short interest is 11.90%, as it is for AMC currently, they are paying 11.90% of the original investment....daily. Is that a lot? Not for them. Can it be? Yep. Once we get that % higher? Absolutely.  How? Follow me.

4. Options EXPIRE every FRIDAY. THIS INCLUDES PUTS (Shorting.) Now...when Friday comes and there are 10,000 contracts that strike at $10.....and each contract is worth 100 shares.....that's 1,000,000 shares that have to be purchased by either a Market Maker, or someone actually executing their right to that price. Possibly more if the option Is being sold to someone else, because this creates Volatility in Options which then makes more people want to get in.

5. TL;DR on that last one. Calls &amp; puts expire on Friday. Calls create a huge demand for shares all at once, and failed puts create larger Short Interest. 

6. If Short Interest payments get too high for the hedgies they scramble all at once to buy shares and save their assets to cover their positions which forces the share price up from sheer volume.


-Short Interest being high is good, but not enough. 

-Buying and holding is good, but not enough.

-Trading sideways (not going up or down in price) is good, but not enough. 

7. The Gamma Squeeze occurs when a large amount of Call contracts expire in the money resulting in a rush of shares being purchased on thr market.

8. The Short Squeeze happens when the Short Interest payments are too damn high and hedgies have to close positions to save their assets (this takes weeks and we are on our way there). 

TL;DR on the whole damn thing.....OPTION CONTRACTS MUST BE PURCHASED AND EXPIRE IN THE MONEY forcing large amounts of shares to skyrocket the share price, creating a Gamma Squeeze. If the Gamma Squeeze is successful and shoots the price up, thereby creating more Option demand, it eases the process of thr Short Squeeze by raising the interest payments. 

BUYING &amp; HOLDING ISN'T ENOUGH! 

I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. I would never suggest you do anything with your money. I'm simply trying to explain definitions and processes for you to use in your own judgment.

we clearly went all hold and sell at the top. people will paper hand at 1k, 1.5k on the way up. i know the mentality of this sub says no one will, but it’s just a reality that some will when their investment is x10-20.

if that happens, is there a chance that HF’s can get out of their short positions and the stock tanks quickly? i know the current prevailing thought is that it will take them days to get out of the squeeze, but that if people start paper handing at 1k? will it still take days, or could it be minutes?

86,m06cxf,"Hello my apes. I recently ate a few of the copper-colored crayons out of a 96-pack, and I'm pretty sure they're laced with Ritalin because I then proceeded to read Kurt Vonnegut's 1959 classic *The Sirens of Titan,* in which he lays out what I can only describe as the most perfect DD I have ever seen. Since I know you don't have books and probably sold all your metallic crayons to buy more $GME (respect), I will lay out the plan for you.

In the book, the main character is the son of a great man, Noel Constant. Noel Constant is a great man, because he turned $8,200 into the largest fortune in the world. How?

He lived in a motel, which contained a copy of the Gideon Bible in the desk drawer. First, he took the first few sentences of that Bible and split it into stonk tickers. So ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"" became IN, TH, EB, EG, IN, NI, NG...

Next, he invested all $8,200 into the first stonk, IN, in the list. And what did he do then?

He held. 

He placed a goddamn limit order for double his investment. He didn't fucking paperhands when his stonks were worth 10k. Or 12k. He diamond-handed all the way up to $16,400, and then pulled out all his sweet, sweet tendies.

And then what did he do?

He turned around and put ALL of it into the next one on his list. $16,400 into TH. Which he held until it turned into $32,800.

You get the idea. 

Now, unfortunately there is no ""IN"" ticker. But there is an ""INT"" ticker. World Fuel Services Corp. Which has a strong cashflow and is poised to start making some big gains once people start flying and traveling again. Or so the internet says; it doesn't actually matter since Noel Constant didn't know a fucking thing about his companies when he invested--it's not until he had majority ownership of a company that made spaceships that he started giving a shit about what they actually did. And we ain't at that stage yet.

So here's the play:
1) Invest in INT
2) Diamond Hands until 100% return
3) Sell 
4) Invest into HE
5) Diamond Hands until 100% return
6) Sell
7) Repeat 1-3 for BE, GI, NN, ING, GO, DC, RE, AT...

Even if this plays only half as well as it does in the book, I will be flying around the solar system in a year or two. But I fully expect it to be far more lucrative; after all real life is far stranger than fiction.

-Doordash has 2x as much revenue as Grub.  
-But the market cap is 10x.  

There are two ways you could go with this, either Grub undervalued or Door is overvalued.  I pick the second.

Doordash, like every other food delivery, is still losing money.  This is important because the pandemic is ""as good as it gets"" for Doordash--there will never be another time with so many people ""forced"" into ordering delivered food.  Yet with all these factors lining up beyond their wildest dreams, Doordash is still unprofitable.  How unprofitable?

4th quarter 2020: net loss of $2.67 per share.  
Compared to $3.05 loss per share in Q4 2019.  
That's a gain of 12.5%.  Worldwide pandemic with people holed up in their houses, doordash only ups by 12.5%.  Not bullish.  

**Lockup expiration:**  
Doordash float is 144M.  
[Doordash stock lockup expires 3/9, making 110M shares available.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-discloses-early-expiration-of-lockup-agreements-on-about-114-million-shares-2021-03-01)  

The stock has basically ""peaked"".  Won't there be a massive selloff in the coming weeks?  **It seems rational to me,** that DDash insiders know the stock has peaked, and will want to get rid of shares while the going is good.  

However, the short interest as % of float is only 5.4%.  I would expect a much higher short if it were really going to tank.  For comparison, GRUB shortint is a whopping 20%.  Thoughts?",Doordash should drop.,1.0,1615172863,Avogadro_seed

Chill!  
Don't make the same mistake as Hedgies did. See the opposite side.

A reddit page is on the brink of bringing whole market down. 

Bad people, really really bad people messed up. Hah! well that's news.

now they know you are out for blood and they have tried everything to shake you off your conviction.

Welp! who'd have thought, poor ape angry at rich ape.

&amp;#x200B;

'Eh! Let them have this one.' \~ *Rich MM who isn't short but will be affected if squeeze happens.*

Listen! They will make the squazloozle happen. They have to let it happen.

But think for a second who will buy at 25K ? Who will force them to buy at 25K.

Hedgies, they'll just say oh we don't have the money. Brokers will say we don't have the money. DTCC who may have the money but coming with new rules and shit, who will force them?

SEC? grow up Jamie!

no one will be obligated to buy at those levels even if they are cornered. ***The big fish are pushed to be grilled by even bigger fish, but these seas have only one shark and that shark is good at smelling blood.*** 

That shark's plan?  Damage Control.

Let the stupid Hedgies run dry because of their stupid mistakes. Let one or two fall. Let some save their ass who have hedged or switched their position by buying calls.  Let Robinhood take all the blame. Let the retailers have their day but pull the plug before the hook reaches the shark.

Because no one hunts the shark, until it kills a couple humans. 

and Shark not stupid, shark no kill human. 

Shark let you take your salmon and let gay bear starve.

but Shark will never give you a reason to come after it ...

because there is *only one* shark.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** *they will let it squazeeze just enough to make it look like squeze happened and make some early buyers rich but let their be some bag holders so people don't trust reddit again and you leave MMs alone in future.*
