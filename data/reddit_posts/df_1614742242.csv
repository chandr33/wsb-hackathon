53,lwkazi,"Hi guys, I’ve noticed a big swing of topics and chats on here, yes there are a lot of opportunities and other stock over there, do it once you get GME!!!! Get the big squeeze and then play with that money and put it in another opportunities. 

If you want to change focus create another subreddit with the other stonks or things, is crucial and very important to stay connected, stay with the eyes in the ball and motivated moving towards one direction. GME is the direction.

I’ve also noticed there are a lot of people fearing and a lot of shillas out there, don’t worry about it! Stay true with the reason why we are here and keep the focus! It’s gonna happen soon and it’s gonna happen if we stay together and strong! 

Hold hold fellow apes!! 

If you see a comment that is bias or it’s not positive towards the cause, read it and investigate it with a huge grain of salt, if doesn’t have facts or strong logic just dish it. 

We got this, please try to keep this subreddit on GME and be patient, more stonks and opportunities will arise and once we have the funds we will change the course of humanity!!

This is no financial advice, just a retarded ape that been digging and reading over this and I’m sure I’m gonna get those bananas and trendies!!! We are going to be moon together!!!!

79,lwkec7,"This is my amc story. Last year I took a 9000 dollar loss on MDR a company my buddy worked for that was in business over a hundred years, and they went out of business last year. The year I bought 9000 worth of dips. Lesson learned. Life went on me and my wife saved and bought a second home in our town. I hadn’t put any money in the market since the loss. On January 22 I had 200 bucks to throw in so I looked around all day and landed on amc. 55 shares at 3 something. It was retarded, they were going bankrupt.  A couple days later the price shot to 20 and I was like wtf. I joined Reddit and the feeling I got was palpable. Could it be a bunch of motherfuckers like me can cause a wave like this. A wave that could change the game forever? Fuck me I was in and I’ve since leveled up to 353 shares. I believe in you fuckers, and I want you to know you can count on me to hold and buy where I can. 100 a share would almost pay off my house. 200 and I could shove it in my parents face. 300 and my one man janitorial business I started 2 years ago Is getting a store front. 400 share I’m buying my best friend from high school all new teeth.
