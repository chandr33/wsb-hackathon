I also bought PMO at 0.19, it’s currently sat pretty at 0.33. Is this something any of you other apes have dipped their toe into? 
I’ve done a bit of research and it’s very mixed. Some people saying that it’s not worth the time or money and it’s dead stock and is mega shorted by companies. The other saying that with a merger inbound and other factors, it could hit to $1

Just wanting everyone’s thoughts on this.

49,m1s6zu,"One of the most exciting IPOs this year is coming tomorrow morning - Roblox. This is a company with a strong founder/CEO, huge network effect &amp; ecosystem MOAT, a large and attractive young user base that could propel it to become the next ""Facebook,"" and, for those who appreciate healthy fundamentals, strong and steady topline revenue growth as well as positive cash flows.

Roblox will open at $45, based on its recently fundraising round valuing it at $29.5B. 

I believe that its fair stock price (sell target) is $80. Below is my quick analysis:

\- The average first day gain of tech IPOs in 2020 was 82%. That would value Roblox at **\~$82/share.**

\- Here's something unique about Roblox's financials. **While its revenue in 2020 was $924 millions, its 2020 revenue bookings, which contributed to its actual cash flows from users who bought a lot of Rubux, was double that at $1.9 billions.** Further, while the company didn't report a profit, **it had a very positive free cash flow of $524 million** due to its high $1.9 billion of booking. This reminds me of Amazon's beautiful model of free cash flows which propelled its rocket growth over the year despite seeming unprofitability. 

\- Given Roblox's unique high billing compared to its revenue, **I decided to take the average of its revenue and billing (Average of $924M and $1.9Bn = $1.4Bn) to apply comparable companies' multiples to.** 

\- **Its closest comparable companies are Unity and Facebook (at the time of IPO in 2012).** Unity is trading at 36x trailing 12 month revenue but had negative cash flow with a much less attractive business model. Facebook, another company built on strong network effects, also traded at \~36x trailing 12 month revenue and 100x its trailing 12 months earnings at its IPO in 2012. 

\- If I apply Facebook's 100x TTM earnings multiple to Roblox's $524M free cash flow in 2020, I get \~$52Bn of market cap or **\~$80 in stock price.**  

\- If I apply 36x TTM revenue multiple from Facebook (at the time of its IPO) and Unity today to the average of Roblox's revenue and billing at $1.4Bn, I got \~$50Bn in market cap, **or $77 in stock price.** 

**Highs:**

**- Strong founder CEO:** David Baszucki is one of the most visionary founder CEOs with both solid leadership chops and a strong product vision. 

**- Huge network effect and ecosystem MOAT:** Roblox has a beautiful business model, a hybrid of subscription and marketplace. The ecosystem it has created over a long time has a highly defendable MOAT. Fueled by strong cash flows, the company is also continually investing in its ecosystem.

**- A large captivated young user base - an envy for Facebook and alike and international growth opportunities:** If you are hunting for the next Facebook, it will never look like Facebook. Half of the kids in the US are on Roblox and it's rapidly expanding internationally! Zuckerberg is constantly paranoid about losing the next generation. Here comes Roblox! 

**- Potentially huge advertising revenue opportunities.** Roblox is still at the early stages of exploring advertising revenue opportunities given its huge attractive user base. This can be huge. 

**Risk:**

**- COVID's fading:** As COVID fades, people may go outside and spend less time gaming. However, looking at Roblox' steady YoY growth even before COVID, it seems that COVID was simply an accelerator but not a game changer.",Roblox IPO on 3/10 (tomorrow): My analysis of its sell target,1.0,1615361702,ncoder

Some of their underlings get to rule their own fiefdoms. One of those little spheres of influence is the market.

If they can bomb that little bubble and use it to not only tighten their grip on the flow of money by de facto nationalizing the retail market while refilling gov coffers from the capital gains of the average ape then this whole thing is groovy as far as they care. Theyre gonna fuckin do it.

 Fuck the small fish that get skewered (and HFs, clearing houses &amp; all other moneychangers are small fish when they can be sacrificed to literally gain control of the world market), they win big if GME goes to 100k.

50% of hundreds of billions is hundreds of billions.  That's cap gains tax revenue.  Then kill retail so the stock market is a black hole that occasionally spits out money.  Biden gets the most successful 1st year on record because of 500 billion in new tax revenue &amp; for our own safety the market becomes the magic money machine where we (they) throw in dollars and sometimes they come back.

So yeah, that's all really convenient timing if a bunch of bilion dollar companies have skullfucked themselves one year after a pandemic shut down a large portion of the economy and there's absolutely no relation to the jenga tower that's due to collapse any time now.
