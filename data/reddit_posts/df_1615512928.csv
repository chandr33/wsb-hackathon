1) In response to the UWMC ultimatum to not work with Rocket or Fairway, RKT released info on how much broker business they do.  2) UWMC is reporting that 90% of broker-shops have already signed the all-in addendum, ahead of the 3/15 deadline.  3) This chart from RKT now shows potentially how much business UWMC is going to take from RKT.

2,m36ce0,"Disclaimer, the following doesn't have anything to do with short squeezes, gamma squeezes, or fucking 🌈🐻's.  I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advice. This is purely my opinion. If you invest based on what I say alone, you are definitely retarded. 

If you have been following weed investing, you will notice that despite superior earnings and performance, US cannabis trades for less and in relatively low volume.  As of right now they cannot trade on any major exchange only OTC.  If what the CEO said in a recent report is correct, this may change very soon.

Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close;

Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially.

(SOURCE)(https://ir.curaleaf.com/2021-03-09-Curaleaf-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-End-2020-Financial-and-Operational-Results#:~:text=Total%20Revenue%20for%20the%20fourth,of%202020%20increased%2026.2%25%20sequentially.)

This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US.  They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well.

(SOURCE)(https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/03/10/curaleaf-to-expand-to-europe-with-286-million-acquisition-eyes-eastern-europe-and-africa-next/?sh=5225bd621f04)

They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world.

One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking.  Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.

https://www.marketplace.org/2021/02/26/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks/

I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.  Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market.  If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play.

18,m36gb4,"It's occurred to me several times over the last peculiar week that WSB (and reddit traders in general) owe much of their success to crowdsourcing information and exchanging DD. After the events of yesterday in particular, and having seen the tepid attitudes on here today, I think it bears mentioning that certainly the hedges and MM's are aware of this too.

Wouldn't it make sense for them to attempt some way to fracture morale and resolve then? Not with shills and bot accounts--that's small game--but by making us doubt the exact qualities of this place that pose a threat to their continued hegemony on the market. 

If by some method of attack they can make us doubt the usefulness of this democratizing of trading as we have done (well, mostly all of you; I'm a newbie), they will do it. It's not unreasonable to assume that yesterday was, at least in part, an attempt to do that very thing. Today's lameness could be more of the same.

20,m36gta,"Jim Cramer is not just a clown. He is a villainous shill and crappy stock picker to boot.

Here’s an experiment you can run for yourself to get a feel for Jim Cramer’s track record:

1. Go to [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/mad-money](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/mad-money)
2. Scroll down to the stock screener.
3. Set the “Showdate:” to “All”.
4. Enter any stock symbol into the search box and click ""search"" (and then click ""Show All"" near the bottom if necessary).
5. Repeat step 4 to look up other tickers.

I would estimate that with 90-95% of the stocks you look up, you will notice that he gives buy recommendations (the double-green up-arrows) when a stock is near its top, and he gives sell recommendations (the double-red down-arrows) when a stock is near its bottom.

Basically, he just pumps stocks that are currently hot and popular, and craps on stocks that aren’t. It’s momentum investing, pretty much. His buy/sell recommendations assume companies/stocks that are doing well at the moment will only get better, and companies/stocks going through a big slump at the moment will only get worse. With his picks, you either:

1. Buy high, and then sell low, OR
2. Buy high, then hold (or buy more) higher, and then eventually sell low once the company/stock goes into a big slump.

TL;DR – Jim Cramer’s stock picks = buy high, sell low.",Jim Cramer’s stock picks suck. Here’s how you can check for yourself…,1.0,1615513352,VotedOut

*obligatory: I eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice. if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here, expect to lose money. you have been warned.*

Looking at the recent market shenanigans, the price action, you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this ex-blockbuster-esque company that ***I*** intend to own, aaand the way short sellers / big fish / hedgies are using GME to engage in their pissing contests... I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks/months:

- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as ""Absolute Unfair Horseshit"" to ""Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground"" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was ""playing nice."" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.

- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.

- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).

- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.

tl;dr - Looks like it's just 💎🤚🦍s, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds / Whales now. Get ready for ""stagnation"" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.

Y'all win or I win. The only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers.

See y'all from the boardroom.","Future Sole Owner of GameStop Here, With a Breakdown of What's to Come",1.0,1615514682,lookshee
