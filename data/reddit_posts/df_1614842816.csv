0,lxf7xt,"Here comes my first dd. Sorry for my bad english but i am a retarded german guy.

I will try to analyse why all people hates Biontech. I got some Biontech shares (100@99) but some pfizer shares too (320@31)

Most people seems not unterstand that pfizer is only a ""reseller"" of biontechs vaccin.

Look at yesterday: Brazil orders 100 Million dose of vaccin. Pfizer gains 3% und Biontech lose 4% after that news. The vaccin will mainly produce by Biontech. Pfizer is the Partner for Europe &amp; North- and South America Continent. Fosun for China.

Look at some numbers: Some new Production Places will be open soon. Biontech will produce (min) 2 Billionen doses in 2021. The most are allready sold, some Options for more doses are arranged. Biontech and Pfizer expect more then 15 Billion sales (each).  Biontech should more (Asia + German market). Biontech should make up to 8 Billion profit.

All shares have a volume of 19 Billions Euro together. Do you see the relationship between market capitalization and sales? I am retardard and can only count 1,2,3

Why Biontech is falling down?

Biontech gets 13,6 Millionen Euro in 2008 from MIG Capital. They sold some shares (now over 600 Millionen Euros Profit). They are venture capitalist and dont't go too long.

Is that the only reason?

We have the same situation as Mid December. Biontech starts falling on many good news. What? Yes. No bad news. Many shorter starts playing with Biontech. It droped from 100 Euro to 70 Euro. After some days it going back to 100 and the Short Volume going down.

Look at: [https://nakedshortreport.com/company/BNTX](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/BNTX)

The situation repeats.

Why US people hates Biontech? I dont't know.

Let us look at the last days:

Main German market time (9 to 15:30) =&gt; Biontech going up (arround 1,4% every day)

NYSE opens =&gt; Biontech falls massivly down (arround 4-5% every day)

Today: Biontech starts as every day in germany. We got arround 1% but a massiv nervously Market.

My Plan? I Invest much more in Biontech

Thanks ...

No purchase recommendation! I am new at the business. I don't know what i am do

Edit:

Whats up next (i forgot it):

MRNA is a great MarketChanger. Biontech has many things in the pipeline.  
Something in Phase1: Against:  
\- Advanced Melanoma (Adjuvant and Metastatic)   
\- Prostate Cancer   
\-  HPV16+ Head and Neck Cancer   
\-  Triple Negative Breast Cancer   
\-  Ovarian Cancer   
... many more (i hope 1 will come throw Phase 3)

Influenca combined with C19 (Cash Maker for the next year)

And with BNT122 ( 1L Melanoma with CPI ) a Product in Phase 2

In the Pre Phase there are things against HIV,  Tuberculosis , and more.

If not all products fail =&gt; Cash, if all fail =&gt; i am totaly wrong

1,lxf7y0,"Preface: GME Apes hold on to GME with your diamond hands, this is not a ploy to get you to sell nor is this post for you. This entertainment, not financial advice. This is just a üè≥‚Äçüåàüêª look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to. TLDR first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand what's happening.

TL,DR: The fed is no longer in control of interest rates. Stocks are artificially inflated due to the Fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments, with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments. This used to not be an issue as the Fed was in control of how much QE could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers, but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity, the Fed will now have no choice but to start the process of QT, but to do that they need to sell bonds, which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates. To sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates, resulting in a sea of red and theüè≥‚Äçüåàüêª's taking a trip to tendietown.

Part 1: Macro 101 review:

If you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts, feel free to skip this part. This section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ.

For this DD we will need to understand the concepts of money supply, money velocity, open market operations, QE, and QT. Money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. Money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy. More info at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\_supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity\_of\_money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money)

Open market operations refers to the Fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market, which is one of three monetary tools the Fed has at its disposal, with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this DD. QE and QT refer to quantitative easing/tightening, which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy.

Part 2: What's been happening so far:

Now that we have let the retards off the short bus, lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here. I want to get to what is happening with the bonds and I will try to keep this as short as possible.

As we all know, the Fed has been printing money like crazy since last year, with JPow money machine go brrrr. As a result, the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit, which we can see below in the M2 graph:

&amp;#x200B;

[M2 money supply](https://preview.redd.it/r3kdt4v2pyk61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=251465226f305cd7687d088ee853546ef116f3eb)

Unless you have been living under a rock this past year, the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic. If money velocity is down, people and businesses aren't spending, and if people and businesses aren't spending, the economy contracts. Hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat:

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2 supply](https://preview.redd.it/yqs9c8c6pyk61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b140b90c74d9d2e229e6e72b2cb17631566537)

The primary way that the Fed has been dumping money into the economy is through Quantitative easing, meaning that the Fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations, AKA operation Bears R Fuk. This effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash, freeing up money in the economy.

While the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet, the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year. Why? Because for the most part, corporations, institutions, and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the Fed during open market operations, which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money. Corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates, US Government bond interest rates are garbage, businesses have been risky investments due to the 'rona, and only the stonks market has gone up. If we look at just before the pandemic to today, the value of all the stocks in the S&amp;P500 have increased around 5 TRILLION dollars. The graph that shows this can be seen here [https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp\_500\_market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap).

Keep in mind that the GDP shrunk around 2.3% last year and unemployment is still relatively high, meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all.

Part 3: What looks to be happening:

Ok, that was long. Now onto the bonds.Lets think about what's been happening so far over the past few bear weeks. Bond yields go up, market takes a massive shit, calls on $ROPE increase in value, The Bearcave(TM) becomes the hot new club. Right now, yields have nowhere to go but up, and the fed has no choice but to increase them, thereby tanking the market, which we will see next.

As the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up, the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy, artificially inflating it. If we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity, we will have a serious problem on our hands. This is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased, so more money will represent the same pool of goods, causing an extreme amount of inflation. The money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2, electric boogaloo, but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases.

The fed knows this, and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102). This is quantitative tightening in action, with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy.

But there is a problem that the Fed is currently facing, which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates. To get people to buy their bonds, they have no choice but to raise interest rates. Time is also ticking, as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the FRED money velocity graph, meaning that if the fed doesn't raise rates, inflation will become a problem very quickly, and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire US economy will be extremely fucked. As a side note the ratio of increase is higher in M1 than M2, which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers. Unfortunately for the stock market, but fortunately for the **üè≥‚Äçüåàüêª**'s who have not been hunted to extinction, as bond yields increase, money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy, reducing the total funds in the stock market, causing it to crash.

Part 4: My (Dance) Moves:

Phew. That was long. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this post, it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time, and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities. To take advantage of this I plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS. Again this is not financial advice, and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first, you are actually retarded.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: (not financial advice)

Hi everybody. It looks like my post gained some traction last night. As a thank you to those who have read and commented, I will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all.

One of the more common questions/points is that the fed just won't allow rates to raise because they don't want it to.

Again like it says in the DD, at this time I do not believe the Fed is in control of the interest rates, and will quickly have no choice in the matter, no matter what daddy JPow says they will do. It may not happen today or this week, but it is coming. As money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening, inflation takes off like a bat out of hell. If inflation goes up, the US dollar becomes less valuable, and if it goes up too much, the US Gov't will have exciting new problems to deal with. To reduce the money supply through QT the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply, meaning that they need to sell bonds, which will require higher interest rates because they just aren't selling with the shit rates they are at now. The rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain.

Another question is that why hold cash if there is inflation? Won't I lose money?

That may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold, but you will have much less of it if you HODL during a crash or try to time the market.

OK, now that some questions have been answered, bonus round:

First lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out. The best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand. If we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market, we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value, as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market.

Another thing to realize is that the Fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it. No matter what they do, there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags. Loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad, as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds. Capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market, potentially sending shocks through the system. Do nothing and inflation fucks everything. Raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet. Rates are also so low they can't be decreased further.

Finally, no matter what happens in the market, UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS are currently at rock bottom prices. There is little room for them to shrink, but an enormous amount of room for them to grow.

Once again, thanks everybody and this is not financial advice.

JPow Interview and bond activity update: (as of 3/4/21, 4:00 PM)

Interview sauce: [https://www.wsj.com/video/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html](https://www.wsj.com/video/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html)

US 10 year bond yield rates: [https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, this will be the last update on this DD before I let it ride and see what happens. After watching the JPow Jobs Summit interview, there are three things to take away, with the first two relevant and the third being very important. First is that at (3:55), Powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening, the Fed will be expecting excess inflation. This is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases, we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation.

The second is that for now, until the fed sees its goals met, i.e. max employment and price stability, or until inflation becomes a problem, the Fed will continue its policy of QE (timestamps 9:55 &amp; 18:55). This will continue to inject money into the economy, so no big surprise there, but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market, so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market, that may potentially have an effect on the current QE being undertaken.

The first two things are not surprising, but the third big takeaway is quite important, which is that the Fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates. At (13:50), Powell was asked about the market sentiment that the Fed will raise rates earlier than expected. His response was that the Fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive. As of now, inflation is around 1.5%, and the fed has a target of 2%. Powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory, but at (24:30) **Powell also said that the Fed will not let inflation get out of control,** and was very adamant about that.

The third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the US Gov't is struggling to unload bonds, it seems to suggest that the Fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity. The sentiment in the bond market seems to agree, with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1.564%. This is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve, and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market. If this continues I would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks, further crashing the stock market. See y'all at my new favorite club, The Bearcave(TM).
