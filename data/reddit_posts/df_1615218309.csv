23,m0ijuk,"I'm broadcasting true news across all of my social media platforms at any cost.  So in order for WV Can't Wait, The Democratic Party, and Kroger themselves to have time to cover each of their own asses when I release that statement on my Facebook in the coming weeks (because people in WV are gonna blow the F up when they read the N word, JFK and Lincoln assasinations, and 9/11 conspiracy when they peice it together), I am telling you this first so that at least someone that I trusted to run my government knows where I stand on the issues.


I'm going to my boss at Kroger in just a few minutes and delivering the same typed message I emailed to you last night and asking for a corporate job (because I know my value), and finally I am emailing that same email to Joe Manchin so that it very clear we aren't playing games anymore when it comes to Budget and Wages.


If you think my message can be broadcasted in a different way and have the same powerful impact that it will have once it sets into the fabric of our people, by all means, lets talk about and exchange ideas before I release the demons of Hell upon the Facebook Etheral World. Down below we go.


*******************************************************


I am not exactly sure where to start this or where it is going to end, but it is a lot and it is very, very deep. I know that because I am a poor and couldn't afford to continuously apply to graduate studies, I've had to live my post-college adult life in an unorthodox and what seems to me, most of the time, pretty shitty way compared to those who've come from just the smallest amounts of wealth.  Let me be extremely clear, this is not me bitching about what they have and I don't anymore.  This is me pointing out the clear systemic imbalances in our society that continue to keep hard workers like myself depressed financially and emotionally.  Because I don't have a graduate degree, take everything I say with a grain of salt.  You're reading something written by an average Joe loser who makes $10 on the hour and has the most incredible ability to fuck things up with the most important loves of his life.
I graduated from university on May 7, 2016.  My grandpa's birthday.  To me, it was the most important day of my life.  All the hard work had finally paid off, so yippee.  Six whole years.  That's how long it took me to make it through.  Three major changes took place before I finally decided I was going to change it to Political Science.  The first was Business Management, the second was English, and the third major I chose before my landing destination was Psychology.  I am going to do my best to recall everything that happened to me that has driven me to where I am at in life right now.
Which is alone, again.
I didn't know Jack Shit when I first got to college.  I joined a frat fall semester freshmen year and thought I was having the time of my life at that point.  For the first time in my life, I had ""friends"" and the parties were lit compared against anything I had ever been to during my high school years.  Well, the parties and socialites got the best of me and I ended up losing my scholarships at the end of the year.  This meant I had to do what any good American male does to prove to his peers that he isn't a *complete* idiot that peaked in high school.  I will say this, my use of weed didn't start until the spring semester that year and I don't know if it was the ganja or getting burnt out from being drunk every day that was getting the better of me, but it was that summer when my best friend from high school visited home for the summer that I really started to rely on it to get me through my days.
I played sports in high school, football and basketball. I know some people immediately think ""dumb jock"" or ""meathead"" but I knew getting through college was the only way I would ever start to become a man or functioning member of society or anything at all, really.  That, or I would be stuck in Hinton working at Kroger for the rest of my life.  Being afraid to ever speak my mind, or better yet, speaking out and losing my job and then having nowhere to go because of my lack of education is what terrified me.  And after watching my dad give his life away to Kroger for 35 years to this day, I am happy knowing that this is the course I have to go on.  But I'll be damned if I let any other kid have to suffer to make it through the way I had to. I lost friends, time with family, and so many women that I loved very deeply because of one simple truth: I didn't have enough money.
I didn't succeed in my first three majors, otherwise, I wouldn't have graduated from Concord University with a B.A. in Political Science under the guidance or Dr. Sally Howard and Dr. James White.  In retrospect, I can tell myself that those first three majors would probably be a lot more relaxing than learning all the fucking shit I have learned and piecing it all together.  E.g., Dr. Howard was leading a lecture one day and I couldn't tell you now what she asked or what the discussion was on but I remember my reply to whatever she said and the reply was the story my grandpa told me about ""the vault underneath the Greenbrier Hotel that is a casino/bunker for resettlement of Congress and the American Empire, should the United States of America ever be invaded.""  &amp; what better place to lead the insurrection than in the Mountain State? West Virginians have guns, lots of them, and they know how to use them, too.
The best part about the story? The man who brought my grandpa down into the bunker, Ted Kennedy. Ted wrote a handwritten letter to my grandpa, thanking him for the time spent in West Virginia.  I have that letter.  To be honest, as a child, I had no idea how big of a deal that was until the past few years of my life.
Civilization is in the dawn of a new era because of the internet and social media.  Let's think about history for a moment.  400 years ago information throughout societies flowed between people via word of mouth, printing press, or hand-written letters.  That was how the law of the land and the word of the Bible were spread across all parts of the globe during the colonization era. 1600 is an important year for us to remember because we need to learn about the stock market to understand where society is today and where society is heading tomorrow.  In 1600, the first stock/share/equity market was born in 1611 in East India.  East India is also a very important location during these years of the 17th century.  On one side of the earth, you have England.  The West's leader.  But on the other side, you have China.  The East's leader.
Smack dab in the middle of the earth, if I am looking at a map through the lens of the Mercator Projection, is East India.  At this point in time, humans trade humans as livestock, just like cattle. As we just established, the two most important powers on the earth, trade there.  And what do they trade?  They trade something that we do not trade in America today.  I know we do not trade these things in America today because I have a president who took a bullet in the head for it right after my country re-united after its Civil War.  If you haven't figured out what they trade yet, I'll tell you.  They trade people.  Not the way we do today, which is speculatively through the lens of a computer screen as we play with people's life savings, but speculatively through the downtown marketplace where slave owners just delivered their fresh crop of indigenous people shackled in iron.
But fast forward to the 20th century and within 300-325 short years of the human experience since the first equities market inception and the consequent Renaissance moment that occurs, the whole paradigm of how information and trust were changed forever after the invention of the radio.  Radio did something very important for the people.  The people within a society were being brought together, not by the word of mouth from their leader, but, for the first time ever, directly from the mouth of their leader.  The results were not one, but two, World Wars. I.e., the results were astounding.
And I don't mean astounding in a good way, either.
Anyone with a Google Machine in their pocket can pull it out and find out the things I am saying are our culture's actual history.  Okay, I hope you are buckled in because here comes the real shit that someone is going to claim as conspiratorial -to which I am going to fire back with everything mentioned above. The timeline of things says I am right, even if I don't have the graduated empirical methods to prove it.
How did we cool everything down after the events of WW2?  Let's cut the shit and be adults here. From 1945-1962, only 17 years elapsed which meant that too many people on this earth remembered what had happened during the war and that there was no way all the people of the world, who lost their entire livelihoods, were just going to lay their guns completely down, even if white flags had been waived.
The Korean War and the Vietnamese Wars were the Pacific fights that had to remove the final reminiscent values Japan instilled throughout the Pacific rim.  It's like how Germany was divided into two after the war.  It's like what America would have been if we would have lost the war.  It's like what America would have been if we would have lost the war.  It's like what America would have been if we would have lost the war.  You know, The American Reich is on the east coast and the Japanese Pacific States on the West.  I bet somewhere in between there would be a neutral zone, a lot like they portray in ""The Man In The High Castle.""  No, this isn't a conspiracy based on what I watched on Amazon Prime.  This is due diligence based on the fact that my 5th-grade science teacher, Roy Cooper, whom I also politically campaigned against, taught me that would have been the outcome of the war when I was in elementary school.  Most people today don't even realize that there were actual plans laid out for the division of the Americas amongst the Axis.
More cool facts about Roy Cooper:  one day he was leading a lecture in class about immigration and the industrial wave of immigrants to the country.  We had already learned about the War so we knew that German's were bad because they were going to kick America's butt with an A-Bomb and take our land from us if they won.  Mr. Cooper told our class that we all should go home and ask about our heritage: he said something like, ""be it from Europe or Native American or wherever some of you are going to be surprised to learn where you come from.""  So I did that.  When I got home I asked my grandpa where our family came from and can you believe his answer?
""Germany.""
Whoooaaa, Red Flag.  At least to me, at that time, it was.  For the majority of my life, I have been embarrassed by my namesake because it was hard to pronounce and because Germany has the most negative political and historical context.  My favorite part about it all now is seeing a colorized photo of him from his youth when he had bright blonde hair to match his deep blue eyes.
But something else Mr. Cooper taught me about America, and why none of it mattered where my family or I came from, was the American Dream.  That idea that if you just get up every day and go get the job done, you're going to make it in this country.
Holy Fucking Cow, that was a bigger lie than was broadcasted to the nation and the world to describe why the events of why 9/11 happened.  We can go back and forth all day long, so let me just sum it all up real fast.
Yes, airplanes hit the Trade Centers. I know that because we saw that happen live, on national television, together. And people on the ground in New York who eyewitnessed the events unfurl, also saw the same shit happen.
Yes, a lot of people died there.
But what about the Pentagon?
The wingspan of the jetliner that hit the Pentagon was over 90 feet, but the hole created by the explosion was less than 68 feet wide.
Also, the height of the Pentagon is 77 feet tall and the height of the jetliner was about 40 feet high.
My god, Stephen, how fucking slow would that plane have to be traveling at to get the velocity under control to hit that small of the target directly on the ground. Basically, that airplane would have had to be coming in for landing like at an airport to pull this shit off.
I want you to know that I did join the Air Force so I do think about weird shit like that.
My point about this is that the Pentagon is the most secured building on the entire planet, and only one camera angle was able to catch a glimpse of the crash? Give me a break, if there is one thing someone like Marjorie Green Taylor is actually right about, it is that 9/11 is a total inside job. And I just so happen to have a video from the internet with camera footage looking directly at the pentagon from a direct view which would have recorded the God damned plane flying into the motherfucker.
I know what we did, we tested our drone missiles on ourselves to make sure they would work before sending the troops to the middle east for a decade to enforce their new customs under our watchful eye from the drone pilot's seat.
Why do I know this? Because 45 shut the government down for 3 months because he didn't get his way over his border wall and blamed a caravan of illegals crossing the border. If the Mexican invasion was really an imminent threat, Trump would've sent the drone strike down on them just like the Iranian General.

But unlike MGT, I'll play along because I understand that George Bush sent a very powerful message to the entire planet that day that every single person saw, together, at once. And this was because of the internet.
Yes, the TV and Radio accomplished bringing the masses together under the same flag. But that was always controlled and manipulated by whatever said state.  This attack was different.
America is a very young country and we are still trying to figure ourselves out.  What social media is doing to us today is having the same effects that radio had on the great nations of the world 100 years ago.  And I also know that there are countries in the world that want to use social media to divide us before they can conquer us. This is why what I am saying is so incredibly important.
That shit worked in the Middle East.  At least I think it did, and I think that because I know I saw some media outlets like Fox and CNN run coverage on Libya overthrowing Gaddafi back in '11.
That shit would have worked well in America, too, on January 6th, had the Congress been sacked.  President Biden would have never assumed power, and the media would be have been censored so that nobody but the people on the ground would have known how bad it actually was that day.
America has a way out and it's through an open-book apology of the truth. We attacked ourselves so that we can unite the entire globe and the Fed gave America a blank check to prove it, a lot like Hitler did to their currency during The Third Reich. The difference is that with today's technology we can create the society Germany attempted (good lord please don't assume I mean concentration camps), without the sacrifice of lives based on illness and heritage and religion but most importantly, with free-market capitalism.
I know this because I've been a Robinhooder since March 2017 and jumping directly into the financial system is the most rewarding thing a true American Capitalist can do.
Germany would have gone to the stars if they won the war.
This is why the slogan among millennial investors ""rockets to the moon"" are so important.
It's the truth because it is the actual physical truth. America has to build a space force and it has to be prepared to send people into the galaxy to find other rocks to mine for mineral resources in order to keep what we have currently going, going. And it's also the truth because of the metaphorical truth, that was you see is what you believe.
We saw America send a man to the moon already. So unless we are ready to say we faked the moon landing, we have got to embrace our failures and our successes as a country together.  We have to be brave enough to know that the world is watching our every move and be conscious of the fact that our moves can alter and affect the lives of people on the other side of the planet that we will never meet.  And at the same time, those same people over there have to have trust in us that we will do the right things so that all people on the earth prosper, together.
A backdrop on why I ran for office: In December 2018 I had finally cracked the financial systems code because 45 shut the government down for 3 months. Literally, all you have to do is just fucking buy shares of whatever company you want to start investing in and hold them till the cows come home. Better yet, because I drive for Uber and can get paid immediately, I can immediately invest my money straight into the market that fluctuates every Monday-Friday from 9:30-4, which allowed me to follow Big Daddy Warbucks's (Warren Buffett) Golden Rule to a fuckin' tee: ""Buy The Fucking Dip.""  Let me tell you, I bought that cool ranch dip and couldn't get enough of it, and when the government opened back up that January my metaphorical rocket blasted straight off the God damn earth.  I made $600 in 30 fuckin minutes after $SNAP released their Q4 earnings.  Jesus, as my witness, can confirm that at that point in my life, I knew I had the knowledge that would transform WVian lives.  
My roommates at the time were from Nigeria, and they were the most humble people I have ever met. They helped me understand the economy from their perspective when they asked me, ""Do you think Ni*ger is an offensive word?""
I responded, ""Hell Fuckin Yeah It Is. I live in a state where people use the word thinking that it is just a 'word' when that 'word' was the word used to psychologically enslave your people.""
It was the most enlightening three days of my life. I couldn't sleep because of what I had just understood for the first time in my life.
When I raced home to Hinton in March 2019 to address my concerns about my findings and why felt I needed to run for office, I met Cleo Matthews.  Mrs. Matthews has a daughter, Sylvia, who was an aid for Obama.  Long story short, Cleo is the woman who actually vetted me for office.  Not Shalom, and not Debbie.  Both did their part to help get me elected, but as we drew closer to the election, my bad fortune of being poor ruined another very personal relationship for me.  Because I am smart enough to know that WV is too stupid to understand these things I just wrote about are facts, I explained to Cleo that someone had to send the message to the world some frickin' way and whenever I saw the signal I would just ""know.""  This conversation is important to West Virginia because she and I spoke about our people being robbed of a life promised to them by John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
JFK campaigned heavily in WV and rightfully so.  Any good politician or investor knows that the things we buy and produce have to come from somewhere, more specifically, the materials fused together have to come from somewhere.  And in America, those materials are mined in Appalachia and all the items that derive from the materials mined are fabricated somewhere, creating jobs, jobs, jobs.  But those jobs are not given to our people because the companies who mine and sell those products (the raw earth elements) do not wish to create a sustaining, cyclical economy inside this state because they know that by doing so, West Virginian's who have had to rely on the government's tit for so long, become the richest and most powerful people on the planet, instantly.
From an educated WVian millennial standpoint, it almost makes sense that gun control is in our national news, terrifying one party that the other is coming to take their guns away.  I say this because of the way things will evolve if we do.  West Virginia has the most minerals in the country, and the dumbest and poorest fucking people, which means our sorry people will work any job just to take a bone home, even if the meat has already been plucked all the way off.  WV Can't Wait campaigned on the Mine Wars so we know that this setting can take place because it did take place, right in our home state.  And now, the Republican Party is in the capitol this very session stripping away constitutional rights to assembly and free speech by outlawing the ability to motherfucking strike.  They literally have their own people voting their rights away.  They are clearly going to be able to pass labor laws making it illegal to strike which means that they could very well do what next, to ensure that we go to work and shut the fuck up?
But because we have the most guns compared to the rest of the country, we can also prove that Mountaineers will always be free, very easily if anyone tries to step on our turf.
Stephen, I know that message ^^^ isn't your style of campaigning, but the people here need a Governor like you and molding that message right there to your style, while emphasizing my fury, could very well be your ticket to the Governor's Mansion in 2024.  And the best part about it? It isn't a lie, even if it sounds dark.  But we are in very dark times, even if the lights are blinding us too badly to see it &lt;----- big social media metaphor right there.
Then that fateful day of January 28th, 2021 came when the idiots, who have no place in the free market according to the rich which have dominated the poor through media blitzes and false flag attacks for all of civilization, brought all that to an abrupt halt.
Most people on the left were afraid that 45 would lead us into another Great War, and maybe he has laid a precursor toward it.  After March 2020's market meltdown, the Fed printed off 25% of America's economy like it was out of thin air or something.
Someone special that I lost because I didn't have enough money to build a house on her farm in the first 4 months of our relationship, bought me a book, ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Grahm.  In chapter 3 of the book, it goes over some detail on the analysis of the S&amp;P 500 market from the years 1870-1971 which is important for two reasons: 1) 1870 marked the first decade after the Civil War in which Holdings companies who previously held capital in the form of human life and therefore had previous equations for statistical data for basing the labor output of slaves had to be revised to measure the difference between the new labor force that legally had to be paid a premium under labor laws of the United States, making the previous bottom and top lines unuseful in determining true market value, and 2), in 1972, the NASDAQ was born and the age of electronic screen staring trading became the norm.
This sort of trading gave investors access to watch their investments in live-action for the first time and some assholes found out that if they remove expenses from the bottom line (let us say in the form of employee wages), that would make the top line inflate like a hot air balloon.
And what is the top line directly tied to? Board member salaries and ***TAX FREE DIVIDENDS*** that goes directly to the shareholder's pockets.  Which a great idea in theory and an even greater idea when properly exercised.
Then in 1994, 400 years after the first market and oral tradition law, we made it through major paradigm shifts throughout the 20th century that gave the poor their first shot at an equal society.  When Clinton gave everyone the internet in 1994, everyone went stock crazy, and rightfully so. Now, I understand what the term ""Dot Com Bubble"" actually meant.
What we are doing now, well, what the big banks are doing now, is speculating the future.  Which literally means ""we don't know.""  But on rare occasions, the science and the data from day-to-day and week-to-week charts compounding with outstanding shares available will point out variables in the market place and that is what happened with GameStop.  When you are betting in the future's market, it's completely different than just buying and owning singular shares.  Essentially, you are betting that a companies stock price will either go up or down before Friday afternoon at 4 p.m. and this occurs weekly.
You can place bets for the future price in timed intervals that space out over the course of weeks, to months, to years.  The most volatile are always the weekly contracts, and the ones that are getting closer and closer to their Friday afternoon also become increasingly volatile as the expiration date approaches.  It is much safer to place bets far into the future because if you bet wrong and don't sell your position, you lose all of your money on that exact date that you chose.  That is also different then buying and selling individual shares because the only way for those shares to disappear is if that company goes completely out of business, which is actually a rare occasion.
Hedge Funds placed bets when Obama was still in office that GameStop would go out of business this year because the brick and mortars are being beaten by online retail, which is true. But it can never truly replace the on-the-ground shops that consumers love to run to that same day they have the urge to have something new.
Right now, Amazon is trying to enter the grocer industry.  Kroger has its foot set in that market already, but Amazon has a market cap 100x the size of Kroger, which means someone like Kroger has got to be innovative in its approach to take Amazon on in the next decade.  I figured out that the reason Kroger stock price is dropping is that the company is under a short attack from someone out there (don't know who but I can read a graph) and I guarantee it because we have a unionized workforce, which means that Amazon would have to pay its grocer employees a wage and benefit package that mirrors the current market, which is held by Kroger going into the future. Kroger beats Amazon because the network of food chains is already in full swing across the nation, whereas Whole Foods is Suburban and is going to have expanded drastically to overtake the rural areas that Kroger was able to corner in the Marketplace.
Walmart and Target are not true grocers, they retail outlets. Amazon is not a true grocer, it is an online retail store.
Kroger has the unique opportunity to be different than both.  Because they already have the grocery sector covered nationwide, the investments they need to make are directly into their online sales force.  However, they need to separate the retail and the grocer experience so that the groceries are still store-bought at your local brick and mortar, while they could innovate their online retail experience to rival Amazon or Alibaba.
People can't wait 5-7 days for food and water to arrive.  That is where Kroger could dominate more than Amazon.  And the best way to do this is to have Kroger adopt the GameStop economy.  To do this, they would need to increase employee wages but also write into the company by-laws that the increase in salary/wages is for stock buybacks.  This gives Republicans the stock inflation programs they love and gives Democrats the socialist programs they love.  It's a win-win.
The kicker? The company has to allow the employee to buy or sell more of the stock which depends solely on their happiness in the actual marketplace.
The S&amp;P 500 is different from companies in the Option Market because it offers three weekly expiring contracts, i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and they also always expire at 4 pm.
I assume that having three days of the week for this setup is a way of helping the overall market fluctuate up and down throughout the business week instead of just having it all blow-up or down over the course of few weeks because one or two companies were having good or dismal runs.
Back to the real problems.
There was a lot of pressure that needed to be unloaded in certain ways and I am not going to be the person that says America did it right or did it wrong, I am just the guy saying  ""sorry it had to be that way.""
All I am asking is that we teach people in school to buy the stock of the company they go onto work for because that is what the GameStop Economy is going to be if we can harness this power we've just unlocked properly.  We know what the BurgerKing Economy is. It sucks and we are all poor because of it.

I have not researched this at all but it does not seem like they do anything unique.  Seems like smart TVs can now do whatever ROKU does. I get that many TVs now have the ROKU built and the company must have a good brand and good strategic partnerships but what is stopping this company from fading into nothingness.  I get that one might say the same about a company like netflix but neflix makes new products (i.e., new shows).  Roku does what?  Redesigns their shitty control?  Makes the device slightly smaller?  Why would I use a ROKU when my TV doesn't need it?

So by now we all or at least WE should all know that you need to move your account out of RH. I've had a Fidelity account open for a few months now, but haven't transferred yet for the reason below.

Those of us that haven't left RH yet, Its because were afraid of missing the squeeze while out account is in transit to our new broker. I've gone back and forth between pulling the trigger and just getting the move started, but with a once in a lifetime chance with the stock here I just cant bring my self to go until its done. A lot of you have moved to other platforms, and I haven't seen a thread like this made yet, so lets get some insight from others here.

Those of you who have moved to other platforms, how long did it take you? If this is a process that takes like 5 business days, I'm not sure I can take that risk. Comment in here and let us now how long your transfer took, or an opinion on just getting it started or not. I see comments all throughout the subreddit about this but never a dedicated thread to bounce ideas and actual experience off of.

ACCEL Entertainment owns most of the slot machines and VGCs in bars and local gas stations in IL.  Accel is the largest distributed gaming company in the US.  

They recently signed an exclusive deal with Draftkings link[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/079c777d-74c8-37f4-a9a2-6ca4579917f8/why-accel-entertainment.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/079c777d-74c8-37f4-a9a2-6ca4579917f8/why-accel-entertainment.html)

Last week bought century gaming. They are the largest gaming company in Montana and Nevada.  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accel-entertainment-announces-expansion-montana-220000276.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/accel-entertainment-announces-expansion-montana-220000276.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Not great at going through financials but I do know that bars have been shut down for most of Covid and they are about to unleash the flood gates (especially with the stimulus).  At one point the stock was up to $15.11 prior to Covid opening and also prior to Century gaming.  

Price today is \~$11.67

I think near term rise back to $15

Give it 1-2 quarters to hit $20+.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone compare financials with PENN gaming to understand the valuation better?

What you probably don’t know is how huge 115m shares is for the price. To give perspective, average daily volume on DoorDash is right below 5m. Also, I think DoorDash employees will have a few brain cells and decide to sell at 140-150(massively overvalued).
