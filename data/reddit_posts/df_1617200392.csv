I was ridiculously stoked when it made me enough to sell out and buy GME with it.

And then that excitement doubled when the stock crashed from the high .70s down to the low .50s the next day.

But then I go and look at it, and realize after only watching GME that the damn thing went and gained 60% in the last month, most of it in the last two weeks!!

(for the smol brains) that means stonk go up, indicator thingys ""predict"" bullish outcome, stonk go down, indicator thingys are bearish. some people on the sub seem to think indicators can predict the future, and I cannot overstate how retarded that is. That's the equivalent of saying ""since stonk has gone up it will go up *more*"". How fucking dumb does that sound to you?

Basically they moved their annual 10-K to 15th April instead of today. They applied for NASDAQ on December 24th , and recently a couple of companies that applied 2-3 weeks before them got uplisted. So it might as well be just a plan by the company to put out some very good PR prior/straight after uplisting which should help guide the PPS up.

According to WeBull analysis, [short interest](https://i.imgur.com/sPC5ajX.jpg) is steadily mounting, so that's nice. Also, I'm not sure what [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/R5GM2ai.jpg) means, but I like the way it looks.
