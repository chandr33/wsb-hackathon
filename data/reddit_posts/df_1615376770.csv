🚀 Zoom Video Communications says its mission is ""to make video communications frictionless,"" which it
seeks to accomplish with a unified, video-first communications platform that incorporates video, voice,
chat, and content sharing. The company offers a differentiated peer-to-peer technology, complete with
proprietary routing technology. Zoom is a recognized market leader in meeting software and is
disrupting and expanding the $43 billion video conferencing market with its ease of use and superior
user experience. Zoom has product and technology advantages, but there may not be 
enough for a moat at this stage in its life cycle.
Zoom relies mainly on a low-touch e-commerce model that lends itself to viral adoption, but it has also
established a direct salesforce to gather and serve larger, more strategic customers. The company has
been adept at adding users, especially during COVID-19-induced lockdowns, and it also has several
related products to upsell. Zoom has already produced a full year of GAAP
profitability, and has seen quarterly non-GAAP operating margin top 40%.
With the recent introduction of Zoom Phone, which it does not plan to sell to customers who do not
already have Zoom Meetings, the portfolio is expanding meaningfully. The company’s focus is squarely
on adding as many users as possible. This starts with generating buzz and familiarity with free users,
while the direct salesforce sells to enterprise accounts. Customers are growing rapidly, with larger
customers numbering more than 988, while smaller customers total approximately 370,000.

🚀

🚀

🚀

🚀  Revenue grew 369% year over year to $882 million, which topped the high end of guidance of $811
million. Demand remains robust as Zoom continues to gather new customers, which continue to
contribute more to revenue growth than existing customers are--unusual for a software company of
Zoom’s size. Demand remains strong across all verticals and customer sizes, which was initially
pandemic-driven but is resulting in dee okper walled penetration at larger paying customers. Customers with more than $100,000 in trailing annual revenues accelerated meaningfully once again to 156% year-
over-year growth to 1,644. Clearly larger customers added meaningfully to their seat count, but small
customers contributed 37% of revenue, up from around 20% over the last couple years. As the world
opens back up from COVID-19 over the next several quarters, management expects churn to be elevated
from its 4% monthly historical norm, but notes that turnover has been better than expected over the last
couple quarters and net dollar expansion remains strong.

🚀

🚀

🚀

🚀  According to Morningstar, fair value estimate for Zoom is $223 per share, which implies a fiscal 2022 enterprise value/sales
multiple of 17 times, adjusted price/earnings multiple of 60 times, and a 1.5% free cash flow yield.
Despite the substantial model reset higher after the April 2020 quarter, multiples remain near the top
end of the range for software companies.
There are two related controversies surrounding the stock: 1) how rapidly will the user base
grow and 2) how long robust growth can continue. Forecasts suggest aggressive growth continuing in the coming
years and model total revenue growth in excess of 40% in fiscal 2022, decelerating to 20% in fiscal
2026, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate of 26%. Revenue will shift more
toward existing customers over time, and solutions beyond Zoom Meetings (Rooms, Connector,
OnZoom, Zapps, and Phones) will increase within the mix. Models estimate non-GAAP operating margin
actually contracting modestly from 37% in fiscal 2021 (actual) but still remaining in the mid 30% area
through fiscal 2026.
In its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion
by 2022, based on data from IDC. This market is likely growing at approximately 3% annually, with a
clear shift toward cloud-based solutions like Zoom’s. Management further believes that Zoom’s
opportunity is larger, especially after blowout results throughout fiscal 2021, as video penetration can
increase materially as users experience the ease of use and robust features the platform offers. Phone systems make up the lion’s share of this total market, with conferencing (including
video conferencing) accounting for 10%-15% of the total.

🚀

🚀

🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀

Tldr;
Both the Zoom user base and the company’s revenue have grown rapidly and are expected to continue
to do so over the next several years.
Zoom offers a disruptive technology that is designed from the ground up as a video-first collaboration
platform. Customer satisfaction is well above video conferencing peers. Zoom’s low-touch, low-friction model should eventually drive strong margins. The company has already
produced a full year of positive GAAP profitability, which is well ahead of other high-growth software
peers

10,m1vsx4,"Thank you, WSB.

I was down 50% on my account last year due to the market crash and trying to aggressively time the markets up and downs (moral of the story - dont try to time the market). Quad witching burned me quite hard and was the final straw - I ranaway from trading.

It was a dark time, my job and pay was suspended due to lockdown a few weeks after, relationships strained, my alcohol consumption rate rose to a level that would make an Irishman smile.

Decided to come back and persist on January, got back to learning, put strict rules on my trading - sizes, positions, strict entry and exit points, refrained from drunk trading. Kept reading, DDs by DDs, articles by articles, links by links. It worked. Made bank on BB, made bank on GME, made bank on weedstonks, made bank on RKT, made bank on GME 2: electric boogaloo, and quite a few minor gain on some others.

Ended up making 4 times what I lost last year. I put half of the gains in boomer SPY and small amount in bee tee cee as a safeguard.

This all would never have happened without all of you and WSB. All the amount of reading Ive read and learned in the past 2 months, took heaps of you hundreds of hours to write, for free, and gajillions of hours of experience combined and you all willingly give for free. I really appreciate it, thank you so much. 

So, thank you WSB and everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge, experience, and education for everyone to learn. A lot of people and media are portraying wsb to be a bunch of predators, bully frat, whatever, but in my 12 months here in this sub I felt nothing is further than the truth. It's the opposite! People are always so quick here to take time and reply and educate others, correct others, comment to replies with helpful explanations instead of selfishly keeping information to themselves. It is one of the best communities I've ever seen, a crowd-based school of free information. Ive never seen a community that is so non-selfishly educate and teach others like this, and this sub made me regain faith in the kindness of humans.

I hope this sub will last forever, because for those of us who dont have the opportunity to pay for expensive schools to learn about trading and the markets, this sub is a goldmine for knowledge, and its all free.

35,m1vxc1,"#TL;DR : If you sell at $1,000 in the hopes of a dip from a massive short attack, YOU'LL MISS THE SQUEEZE.

I've now seen [multiple posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1j32k/beware_the_most_likely_hedge_fund_tactic_coming/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) of people claiming that the shorts will attack the stock heavily at $1,000 and bring it back down to sub-100 levels. And here's why I think this WON'T happen and might become the next shill tactic.

First off, let's look back at the January pre-squeeze. The shorties had to *cheat* and TURN OFF the buy button to get the price down when it reached close to 500$. 

##Let me rephrase, Robinhood and others had to change the rules of the game in order to bail them out. 

#That's how fucked they were.

That leads me to believe that the shorters were on the brink of getting margin called around the $500-$800 price point.

I've also seen plenty of DD on this sub that concluded that with the volume and price action in late Jan and February, there was no way the hedgies could have covered or repositioned their shorts. Therefore, the price at which they get margin called should still be the same. Now that the DTCC checks their balance every single day, it makes it even easier to margin call them.

Additionally, there was plenty of DD on the gamma squeezes and the **HUGE** number of call options open right now. This means that market makers could potentially buy millions of shares as the price goes higher and higher in order to delta hedge. 

#There's no way the hedgies can short millions of shares to bring the price down.

1. They are already on the brink of getting margin called. 
2  The inverse correlation of $SPY with $GME suggests that they had to sell their other positions in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to hold onto their shorts and to pay the the interest on them.
3. They simply don't have enough money to counter the INSANE bullish momentum we have right now.
4. Do you really think that, if they had that kind of shorting power, if they could stop the momentum we're having, they wouldn't have just driven the price to the ground the past couple of weeks? they wouldn't have just shot the price down from $180 straight back to $20 and kept it there for a month? Here's my takeaway from the recent price movements: They're out of ammo. They are losing the fight and they know it. Therefore they now rely on desperate ""sell at $1k"" FUD and media blackout. They don't want it to squeeze even higher. But it will.

##If you sell at 1k in the hopes of a short attack so that you can buy back in at a lower price, you'll miss the squeeze. 

The price will skyrocket so fast from the market makers scrambling to get millions of shares, from the shorts forced to buy back millions of shares and from the thousands of retail investors FOMOing into the stock, that you'll just be left in the dust, with tiny gains, and huge regret.

#Bottom line: if you sell before 500k, you'll be bagholding $REGRET for the rest of your life.

Think about it: We've seen all the DD we could possibly want. Fundamental analysis says $GME is a strong buy. Technical analysis suggests $GME is going much much higher. $GME is shorted so fucking much that they will have to pay the price you want. 

##This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be greedy and change your life. Don't let it slip away.

Now, why might those ""dip at 1k"" posts become shill tactics? Because they claim with confidence that there will be a dip at 1k. What's the effect? Newbies will try to get a quick day trade out of it, and sell their shares. Now, this little amount of selling will have basically no impact on the squeeze, but these apes will miss the squeeze, because there will be no dip... 

Plus, think about the risk you'd be taking: selling at 1k and buying back in at say 200 would only get you 800 bucks/share of profit. *But you're risking 499k/share of profit!!!* 

#It simply doesn't make sense from a risk/reward perspective to day trade $GME, no matter your risk tolerance.

Another thing I'd like to address is the fear that GameStop might raise money by issuing millions more shares and saving the shorties in the process. I've seen a few comments about this and Uncle Bruce thinks it might happen (as much as I like him, I think his theory will not happen simply from a logical point of view). (Also, don't hate on him, he's an honest guy and he even predicted the $GME short squeeze when it was at $4)

*But heres why GameStop won't bail out the hedgies.*

Why would GameStop save the shorts who tried to bankrupt them with illegal naked shorting and maybe even more shady shit I'm not aware of? Why would GameStop issue shares at 1k or 10k when they know they could raise funds at 500k if they need the money? Why would GameStop stop a short squeeze that would benefit millions of retail investors?

###GameStop's customers are Redditors. GameStop's customers are retail investors. They're not hedge funds. They're not market makers. They're not any other institution.

If they dilute their shares and help the shorts, they would only shoot themselves in the foot. They would face immense backlash, similar to Robinhood. They would lose the faith of millions of individuals/potential customers. They would NEVER recover from such a nearsighted action, and Ryan Cohen, as the (possibly) new CEO, will never let that happen. 

#So, sit tight, hold, and buy more if you can.

GOCO reported earnings yesterday, they made money 133 million or 41 cents per share. 

Fourth quarter 2020 net revenue of $445.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period, and fiscal year 2020 net revenue of $877.4 million increased 63% compared to the prior year period

They are forecasting 1.15 Billion in sales to 1.3 Billiion in sales for 2021 that is 50%

They are expecting earnings of 345 to 385 million that is on 321 million shares.

A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in Stock Market

[**Resources**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Resources%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

Get your tinfoil hat out, its time to see what you think you want to see but don't really want to. This is perfect for any newbie trying to understand what is going on and how the system has ended up the way it has.

Tl;Dr at end.

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** [u/bEAc0n](https://www.reddit.com/u/bEAc0n/)) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

Edit: apparently people cant bother to even type ""Cede and co"" into the internet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede\_and\_Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company)

92,m1w8wo,"Martin Shkreli may have been the most hated CEO in America in 2015, but at least he had moderator status on WallStreetBets. Before that fateful year, when he was dragged into the American limelight smirking and giggling for raising the price of Daraprim, an anti-parasitic drug used to treat toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill, things had been going pretty well for the Brooklyn-born hedge fund manager. At only 32-years-old, he was worth roughly $70 million, and he was able to buy the sole copy of Wu Tang Clan’s album *Once Upon a Time in Shaolin* for $2 million at an auction earlier that year. Life was pretty great. 

Martin wasn’t your typical hedge fund manager. The son of immigrants—both of whom worked as janitors in Brooklyn—he once proclaimed that he was “the most successful Albanian to ever walk the face of this earth.” He had dropped out of high school before his senior year but was able to get enough credits for his diploma through a program that earned him an internship at the Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz, &amp; Co. when he was only 17. 

As an intern at the Jim Cramer founded hedge fund, he didn’t want to just blend in. He wanted to be a star. “I don’t even remember him working for me,” Cramer would later tell Vanity Fair’s Bethany McLean. But Shkreli knew what he saw in the mirror, even if nobody else saw it yet. This was the greatest Albanian to ever walk the face of this earth. A big swinging dick. “Who are the 5 greatest rappers of all time?” he would later ask Twitter in a 2015 tweet. His answer a couple minutes later: “Martin, Martin, Martin, Martin, and Martin.”

&amp;#x200B;

[Who's that handsome man in the mirror?](https://preview.redd.it/gbhsjnlwu6m61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=894a92d423d807153f3a92fafbf3b5874e8e49f9)

At only 17-years-old, having been a loyal employee at Cramer, Berkowitz, &amp; Co. for several months, he began clamoring for his employer to begin short-selling Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company that was testing a weight-loss drug at the time. Somehow, he got them to listen, and when Regeneron stock tumbled, Cramer’s hedge fund made a tidy profit. That’s right, Martin told that handsome face in the mirror, the greatest Albanian to walk this earth.

After four years as an associate at Cramer, Berkowitz, &amp; Co., Shkreli felt it was time to move on to greener pastures. He ended up getting a business degree from New York’s Baruch College in 2004, and then worked as a financial analyst at Intrepid Capital Management for a while. But he was tired of just being some financial grunt. He wanted to ball out. So in 2006, he started his own hedge fund and christened it Elea Capital Management. He was about to make bank, bro.

In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a put option transaction in which Shkreli bet on a broad market decline (did Martin YOLO on 0DTE SPY puts? Perhaps\*). Stocks rose though, and Shkreli didn’t have the money to pony up. Lehman ended up winning a $2.3 million judgement against Elea and Shkreli, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling. Something about its own bad bets on mortgage-backed securities. Shkreli dabbed in his corner office.

The fund eventually sizzled into insolvency though, so in September of 2009, Martin started MSMB Capital Management with his childhood friend Marek Biestek. The two began aggressively shorting biotech companies and expounding upon these companies’ flaws in trading chat rooms. Shkreli was still in his 20s and he had made the *Forbes 30 Under 30* list.

In early 2011, MSMB sold short 11 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics *after* it had already fallen off a cliff, from $9.90 to $2.50 a share. In the ensuing days and weeks, Orexigen rebounded, and suddenly MSMB could not cover their position. MSMB had effectively imploded. Martin sat slumped in his chair, his hoodie drawn up, staring at his screen. Caroline Stewart, who worked for the firm at the time, said that after the failed trade “everything went quiet” in the firm. “The lights were not turned on. People stopped coming into work.” Shkreli informed her that he owed Merrill Lynch—the broker he used in his naked short sale—$10 million. He didn’t tell his investors though that their money had gone up in flames.

In his dark moments, Shkreli found a way out though: he’d just start another hedge fund, this one called MSMB Healthcare. He was able to convince investors to back him again, and MSMB Healthcare would become a lifeline for the original MSMB fund. With one fund bailing the other out, Shrkeli would rise from the ashes like an autistic phoenix. He was no quitter. He was the greatest Albanian to walk this earth.

Why stop at a new hedge fund though? Martin understood pharmaceuticals—he used his spare time to create educational chemistry videos which he uploaded to YouTube—so why couldn’t he run his own pharma company? So, at about the same time that the OG MSMB blew up in spectacular fashion, he founded Retrophin. The company would have an emphasis on biotechnology that could be used to create treatments for rare diseases. 

As CEO, Shkreli and his employees created alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage the short selling of other biotech stocks. In 2014, he upped the price of a drug called Thiola, which was used to treat the rare disease cystinuria, from $1.50 to $30 a pill (patients had to take 10-15 pills a day).

For some reason, Retrophin’s board decided in 2014 that Shkreli, while intelligent, was too immature to be CEO of the company he founded. He was ousted as CEO, and a month later he left the fourth firm he founded. What was next? Why, found another pharmaceutical company, of course.

In February of 2015, he founded Turing Pharmaceuticals which acquired three major drugs from Retrophin: an intranasal version of ketamine used to treat depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin—the hormone and neurotransmitter commonly known as the “love drug” that is involved in childbirth and breast-feeding—and a drug called Vecamyl, which was used to treat hypertension. The business strategy for Turing was simple: obtain licenses on out-of-patent drugs and raise prices as time passed. The markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and the pathway to obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version of a drug is expensive, so Shkreli saw that with closed distribution and essentially no competition, the sky was the limit in terms of pricing.

Only a couple months after Turing’s inception, they acquired Daraprim, a drug approved by the FDA in 1953, for $55 million. In line with their business strategy, Daraprim’s patent had expired, and no generic version was yet available. So Turing increased the price of Daraprim overnight by a factor of 56, and the world took notice. Or, put bluntly, an angry American mob formed.

&amp;#x200B;

[The face of a criminal mastermind.](https://preview.redd.it/ksjnxz79v6m61.jpg?width=625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=476cf43861dbcc0adcd32aa5e8037d4fb408f66d)

In September of that year, Shkreli still was willing to explain himself. He told Bloomberg Markets that despite the huge increase in price, patient co-pays would actually be lower (insurance companies, for the most part, would be footing the bill, not average Americans), and many patients would get the drug for free thanks to Turing’s expanded drug program. Under the program, half of its drugs sold for one dollar. “If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of bicycle,” he told Bloomberg, “and we buy that company and ask to charge Toyota prices, I don’t think that should be a crime.” 

But America was frothing at the mouth. In 2015, with a presidential election looming, candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump all condemned Shkreli and his actions. The optics of the price hike were certainly not good. A few days after his interview with Bloomberg, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price of Daraprim by an unspecified amount, but a couple months later, Turing apparently changed its mind and decided there would be no price cut.

During all this turbulence, it was revealed that Shkreli had purchased *Once Upon a Time in Shaolin* for $2 million at an auction that was held months before the price hike of Daraprim. The public was not pleased. In an interview in 2019 with Joe Rogan, RZA revealed he had tried to advise Shkreli to “take this chance to do some philanthropy” and give the album away to the public. But Shkreli refused. “He didn’t mind being a supervillain,” RZA said. After meeting with him, RZA didn’t seem to have the hate in his heart for Shkreli that the rest of the public did. “He was a very smart dude.”

In December of 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment was filed for securities fraud unrelated to Daraprim’s price. His charges were related to his time as the Chief Investment Officer of MSMB Capital Management and CEO of Retrophin. At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Robert Capers told reporters that Shkreli used his companies as “a personal piggy bank” and that essentially, he was running a Ponzi scheme. The New York FBI Twitter page made an announcement: “#Breaking no seizure warrant at the arrest of Martin Shkreli today, which means we didn’t seize the Wu-Tang Clan album.” Shkreli told *The Wall Street Journal* that he had been targeted for his price hike of Daraprim and his flamboyant personality.

Because of his notoriety, it became clear that it would be difficult to find an unbiased jury. In a transcript released by Harper’s Magazine, the following excerpts shed insight into what the public thought of the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager (Benjamin Brafman was the lawyer representing Shkreli, “The Court” being Judge Kiyo Matsumoto):

*The Court: The purpose of jury selection is to ensure fairness and impartiality in this case. If you think that you could not be fair and impartial, it is your duty to tell me. All right. Juror Number 1.*

*Juror No. 1: I’m aware of the defendant and I hate him.*

*Benjamin Brafman: I’m sorry.*

*Juror No. 1: I think he’s a greedy little man.*

*The Court: Jurors are obligated to decide the case based only on the evidence. Do you agree?*

*Juror No. 1: I don’t know if I could. I wouldn’t want me on this jury.*

*The Court: Juror Number 1 is excused.*

*\*\*\**

*The Court: Juror Number 52, how are you?*

*Juror No. 52: When I walked in here today, I looked at him, and in my head, that’s a snake — not knowing who he was. I just walked in and looked right at him and that’s a snake.*

*Brafman: So much for the presumption of innocence.*

*The Court: We will excuse Juror Number 52.*

*\*\*\**

*The Court:  Juror Number 77.*

*Juror No. 77: From everything I’ve seen on the news, everything I’ve read, I believe the defendant is the face of corporate greed in America.*

*Brafman: We would object.*

*Juror No. 77: You’d have to convince me he was innocent rather than guilty.*

*The Court: I will excuse this juror.*

*\*\*\**

*The Court: Juror Number 144, tell us what you have heard.*

*Juror No. 144: I heard through the news of how the defendant changed the price of a pill by up-selling it. I heard he bought an album from the Wu-Tang Clan for a million dollars.*

*The Court: The question is, have you heard anything that would affect your ability to decide this case with an open mind. Can you do that?*

*Juror No. 144: I don’t think I can because he kind of looks like a dick.*

*The Court: You are Juror Number 144 and we will excuse you. Come forward, Juror Number 155.*

*Juror No. 155: I have read a lot of articles about the case. I think he is as guilty as they come.*

*The Court: Then I will excuse you from this case. Juror Number 10, please come forward.*

*Juror No. 10: The only thing I’d be impartial about is what prison this guy goes to.*

*The Court: Okay. We will excuse you. Juror 28, do you need to be heard?*

*Juror No. 28: I don’t like this person at all. I just can’t understand why he would be so stupid as to take an antibiotic which H.I.V. people need and jack it up five thousand percent. I would honestly, like, seriously like to go over there —*

*The Court: Sir, thank you.*

*Juror No. 28: Is he stupid or greedy? I can’t understand.*

*The Court: We will excuse you.*

*\*\*\**

*The Court: Juror Number 59, come on up.*

*Juror No. 59: Your Honor, totally he is guilty and in no way can I let him slide out of anything because —*

*The Court: Okay. Is that your attitude toward anyone charged with a crime who has not been proven guilty?*

*Juror No. 59: It’s my attitude toward his entire demeanor, what he has done to people.*

*The Court: All right. We are going to excuse you, sir.*

*Juror No. 59: And he disrespected the Wu-Tang Clan.*

The case would get dragged out for over a year, but on August 4, 2017, the trial jury that The Court was finally able to assemble had found Shkreli guilty on two counts of security fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was found not guilty of five other counts. It’s worth noting that he was never found guilty of the charges the public deemed him most guilty of—jacking up the price of Daraprim.

Shkreli informed the media that he was “delighted” with the outcome and said that his prosecution was a “witch hunt of epic proportions.” A month after the ruling, his bail was revoked after he posted on Facebook offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair. Preceding posts unveiled devious plans to clone Hillary Clinton. The judge didn’t think this was funny though, and he was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to await sentencing.

He would appeal the conviction, but in 2019 the appeals court unanimously upheld the jury verdict. Shkreli would continue to serve his 7-year sentence and forfeit more than $7.3 million in assets. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli did appear to be “genuinely remorseful”, but that he had “repeatedly minimized” his conduct. In his statement to The Court, Shkreli apparently became misty-eyed as he told The Court that he was “never motivated by money.""

What did WallStreetBets think of Shkreli and his rise and fall? It’s complicated. While some saw him as a villain, many believed he was misunderstood. While he did raise the price of Daraprim, insurance companies would be picking up most of the tab. Martin did give the drug away for free to those who didn’t have insurance. But it also seemed as though Martin was willing to play the role of the heel. While he at first tried to explain to the public why he didn’t see the price hike as such an egregious act, and then offered to lower the price, he ultimately rescinded his offer and made a joke about his whole trial. Pharmaceutical companies regularly raise the price of drugs, but they often do it slowly over time, in increments that do not raise alarm bells on Main Street. These companies are not much different, they’re just less in-your-face. Raising the drug by over 5,000% overnight was undoubtedly bad optics, but to say it was an attack on the middle-class or those with AIDS seems to be leaving out details of how American healthcare is flawed in myriad ways. Maybe Martin thought he was sticking it to the insurance companies.

For a time, Martin was a regular poster at WallStreetBets. He popped in somewhat regularly to give his thoughts on pharma stocks and drugs that were in development. When he started serving time in jail—a friend would post on Reddit for him—Martin assured everyone that prison wasn’t “that bad”. It wasn’t like how it was portrayed in TV, he said, but “more of a weird college where no one studies or knows how to read.”

Occasionally, he would slide into other Reddit subs that weren’t WallStreetBets. During the height of his notoriety and the approaching trial, he asked r/iamverybadass in a post, ""U got a problem with me?” 

Many on WallStreetBets appreciated Martin for the countless hours he spent creating educational YouTube videos on chemistry and investing (they’re worth a look). Martin was undeniably intelligent, but he was also a troll. His sense of humor, for the most part, was welcome at WallStreetBets even though much of America didn’t feel the same way. Maybe the media had already decided on a narrative for Martin. 

Ultimately, WallStreetBets couldn’t shelter Martin from the rest of the world. And in February of 2016, he wrote another post titled, “Where did my mod status go?” The body of the post simply read, “Noobs.”
