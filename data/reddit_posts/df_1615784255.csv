Adobe‚Äôs powerful position in the professional design and media production ecosystem has given them a valuable foothold in helping their clients get things done. Synergies between Digital Media and Digital Experience will allow Adobe to grow existing accounts as their solutions evolve to support customer operations far beyond creative and marketing.

# Profile

Adobe views its business in two key segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience.

Digital Media (\~75% of revenue) ‚Äì what you probably think of when you hear the name Adobe. Products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Things like Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.

Digital Experience (\~25% of revenue) ‚Äì a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Spoiler: this is where my bull case lies.

In Adobe‚Äôs own words [(Form 10-K)](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):

&gt;*‚ÄúBy integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.‚Äù*

**Inside activity** ‚Äì only two small sales in the last 3 months that weren‚Äôt automatic or scheduled. Net activity is \~300K shares sold (mostly automatic)

**Buybacks** ‚Äì Adobe has accelerated buybacks and recently increased the board‚Äôs share buyback authorization to $15B, as their original $8B repurchase is expected to be exhausted by mid-FY21.

# Climate

Adobe has a formidable moat around its Digital Media business segment, with very few competitors to its creative workflow management solutions. With many offices continuing to work virtually, and companies continuing to invest in their creative infrastructure for remote employees, strong growth in Digital Media should continue. **Whether they love or hate it, every creative professional knows they need proficiency in the Creative Cloud suite, and probably a subscription to it too.**

As Adobe says in their 10-K and [Annual Shareholder letter](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/AdobeStockholderLetter2021.pdf), *‚Äúevery business is a digital business, and the imperative for customer experience management has never been more real.‚Äù* Organizations and brands of every shape and size are wisely looking to improve their digital presence and customer experiences. Whether it's look and feel, project management tools, or e-commerce buy flow ‚Äì Adobe has a solution for it. The pandemic only accelerated the trend, when nearly every opportunity to engage audiences went digital. To that end, the **Digital Experience segment stands to become a larger contributor to future revenue growth.** Adobe will successfully cross-sell Digital Experience solutions to existing Digital Media customers (think e-commerce, marketing and analytics tools, project management tools, etc.).

Adobe will also generate new revenue streams from [recently-announced public sector use cases](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Partners-With-All-50-US-States-to-Modernize-Digital-Experiences-for-Citizens/default.aspx). These federal, state, and local government partnerships will serve as lighthouse accounts for future growth within government, [healthcare](https://www.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/walgreens-boots-alliance-case-study.html), and other public impact sectors. These are reliable customers that are reluctant to switch solution providers due to baked-in opex approvals ‚Äì which makes a SaaS offering incredibly sticky with large institutions.

While we're discussing government and healthcare customers, it's really worth mentioning third party resellers. Again, from the [Form 10-K](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):

&gt;*""We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.‚Äù*

Typical multi-channel, large software company strategy. But these third party solutions providers become incredibly important in highly regulated spaces like government and healthcare. With Adobe's [recent acquisitions](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2020/Adobe-Completes-Acquisition-of-Workfront/default.aspx) and [getting FedRAMP approval in 2019](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/09/20/adobe-obtains-new-fedramp-authorizations-enhancing-its-digital-government-services-in-the-cloud.html#gs.vn62be), they‚Äôve shown they‚Äôre serious about becoming a bigger government and institutional player. These are highly regulated industries, with long and bureaucratic procurement processes. **Often, government and healthcare buyers are only authorized to do business with a handful of pre-approved vendors.** As Adobe continues to integrate and white-label their Experience products to third party partners, they become an increasingly available, attractive option for customers in highly regulated verticals. Inside these organizations, it‚Äôs very difficult for buyers at big enterprise and government customers to win large appropriations approvals (to switch or rebuild systems), and much easier to lock in software solutions as a monthly ""cost of doing business."" As organizations move to opex models like SaaS, there‚Äôs even more stickiness than there used to be.

# Technicals

P/E ratio of \~41.02 seems high, but looking at Adobe‚Äôs closest competitors shows they‚Äôre not the highest.

|Autodesk (ADSK)|49.28|
|:-|:-|
|PayPal (PYPL)|70.72|
|Salesforce (CRM)|48.45|
|DocuSign (DOCU)|N/A|
|SAP (SAP)|29.92|
|Accenture (ACN)|32.61|

It‚Äôs difficult to find a direct comparison, but I think Adobe‚Äôs marketing, analytics and e-commerce ambitions make their P/E getting closer to Salesforce very plausible. Part of Adobe's strength is that there's nobody that directly competes with them on all fronts.

**Analyst Sentiment** ‚Äì solid buy sentiment from 23+ analysts, which has gone mostly unchanged in the last few months. Lowest price target is $500, with the average around $560-$570. I have yet to see a sell rating. ([Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ADBE))

**Moving Averages and Technical Indicators** ‚Äì I‚Äôll let others chime in here, because this is my weakest area of knowledge. From what I can see, monthly moving averages and technical indicators suggest ADBE is a semi-strong buy and slightly oversold, respectively. I expect positive momentum to accelerate due to trading at 6-month lows leading up to earnings, BidenBux coming through, and the market forgetting about the 10yr Treasury Yield. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE?p=ADBE))

Remember, this was trading at $500 a month ago. While I think this is worth a long term hold, I also think we'll see it pop when they post yet another earnings beat.

# Conclusion

Combined with Adobe‚Äôs well-known lock-in for professional design and content production workflows in their Media segment, growing competency in their Experience segment will make Adobe extremely competitive as an end-to-end SaaS provider for public and institutional customers. **Simply put, I believe Adobe‚Äôs Digital Experience segment will  grow to be at least half the size of Digital Media, with large enterprise and government partnerships being a sleeping giant in their pipeline.**

I see that many people here misunderstand and thinks that the 40B valuation merger is too rich for the company. I am from Malaysia where the founders are from and where GRAB started and let me try to share some of the information I researched about the company.


**Disclosures**

I am long AGC after the rumors @ average 14.01
If the rumors and valuations are true the price now at 14+ indicates a valuation of 56B.


**History**

GRAB started in 2012, where it was used by existing cabs to just get customers. Basically then people will use GRAB to book for taxis. During that time, Malaysia was well known for their taxi scams, where tourist and sometimes locals get onto a cab and it brings them to different places taking a longer route  just to charge them a little extra. 

GRAB saw this as an opportunity to increase the transparency and it paid off.
When UBER started, with private hiring cars, GRAB also copied the model and hence started their journey to dominate the SEA and became the No1 ride hailing giants. In 2018, UBER came into the SEA market, and it begin the best time to take ride hailing, with both companies basically being a street fight where both bested each other's with promotions and ridiculous price slashing, where it even makes sense to take GRAB or UBER than public transport, both companies with huge backing (Softbank's Son once told GRAB that they had unlimited supply of cash investment) burned cash piles and in the end, GRAB acquired UBER SEA business and UBER took on 28 percent of GRAB with Dara on the board. 

Since then GRAB was a monopoly in SEA region for Malaysia, Vietnam,  Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand (which operates in a grey zone with support by the government). In Singapore and Indonesia, they are a duopoly with Gojek, their main competitor in the region, but in both countries GRAB is still has the bigger market share when it comes to transportation.


Other than transportation, GRAB visions to be a ""everyday app"" for the SEA community and ventures into a few more other business namely: Food, Fintech, Delivery, Healthcare. So now about the business. It's a little bit difficult to get their numbers since it's a private company so far and so I needed to make assumptions.

**Total unique users**

__________

GRAB estimated 100million in the year 2019. I couldn't find anymore data regarding its growth of users but smartphone penetration rate in SEA growing countries remains to be around 70% , which will be a tailwind for GRAB in the future if it increases to 90% to match the more developed countries in the region.(Singapore, Malaysia)

**Revenue**

__________

Total revenue 2019 is 2.3B as per statista.
Total revenue 2020 is 3.4B by calculation.

I believe their revenue for 2020 can only be broken down into 50% food and 50% transport, the other business is neglect able.

**Transportation**

The only profitable business currently.
To get the break down of GRAB revenues we need to make an  assumption.

In 2019 GRAB estimate of 4B rides with the average revenue of 2.5 dollars per ride (Total merchandise value of 10B). GRAB keeps 20% of it's from their drivers so and annual revenue is around 2B for transportation.

In 2020 their total revenue increase by 70% so an estimate of 3.4B for 2020 should be conservative enough of that half can be contributed to transport. 
Hence it indicates a slow down of the business to 1.7B in the year 2020 due to COVID lock downs in SEA effecting most of their fastest growing markets like Indonesia Philippines and Vietnam.

I expect a strong rebound in 2021 after majority of SEA countries  is being vaccinated and things go back to normal.

Their competitors Gojek seems to only be a problem in only the Indonesian market. They do compete in Singapore but most Singaporeans only uses GRAB due to its first mover position. Drivers also seldom use GOJEK as there are too few people using it to book rides.

**GrabFood**

In 2020, Food increase more than 300% yoy on 2020. 

They do have competitors like Foodpanda Deliveroo, but they are still the No.1 players in 5 out of the 6 markets they are in and has the market share of 50% in the whole of South East Asia. 

Total merchandise value is estimated at 6B in 2020 and based on the above assumption a net revenue of 1.7B. The Food business is expected to be profitable in 2021.


Now I didn't use Grab Food until this COVID lockdown happened in Singapore. But now after reopening I realize that i continue to use food because of the convenience. I believe this may slowly become the main source of revenue for GRAB.

**Grabpay**

Is basically their payment platform. Most outlets do accept GRAB pay and they do have promotional and cash back for using them, it complements well with their transportation and Food business, but this business doesn't seem to dominate the market like the other 2. GRAB seems to have poured a lot of investment into GRAB Pay but competitors from Google Pay and Apple Pay and even Alipay is still fighting for market share in Singapore. I'm not sure about this in other SEA countries

GRAB did get a digital bank license from MAS in Singapore, which will allow them to operate a Digital Bank, but we don't know how will they pan out only time will tell if GRAB will be able to dominate this business.


**Healthcare, Delivery, Mart**

This are some other business that GRAB ventured into but it is not famous for it and most people do not even know about them in SEA. 
For me personally, I would like GRAB to stop investing in the other business and focus on the Transport, Food, and Payment as it shows the most potential and has a route to profitability.

**Valuation**
__________


Now let me try to justify why I bought GRAB at 54B if the rumors that AGC is merging with them at a 40B price tag.

So at 3.4B on 2020 growing at let say conservatively 50% yoy for 2021

It will indicate a 5.1B net rev 2021. Let's slap on UBER P/S ratio of 10.
It will have  a **51B** market cap currently.

The TAM in SEA just for the ride hailing food and transportation is estimated to be around 42B by 2025.
If GRAB can keep it's 70 percent market share that will be a 30B net revenue in 2025.

**Risks**
__________

**Profitability**

If GRAB sticks to trying to be a super app, profitability will be far out in the future. The markets they are trying to dominate will need them to take on competitor which has big tech backing or directly take on  the likes Amazon, Alibaba, Google and Apple and they have deeper pockets than GRAB, they may have to burn more cash and dilute their shares further. 

**Regional markets**

GRAB as clearly indicated that they will only focus in growing in SEA and will not venture out further for the near future. SEA is a exponentially growing market with smartphone penetration expected to grow further in the coming years.
But there is also a lot of political instability in this region, like currently in Myanmar and Thailand which may cause unexpected headwinds for businesses operating there

**Conclusion**
______
So, that's about GRAB being a SEA powerhouse and I believe there is a ton of growth opportunities remaining. I think its fairly cheap considering future growth potential and they deserve the 40B price tag.

I tried to insert photos into the post but I failed miserably. Sorry for the boring text only DD

I also had a huge play about 2 months ago and got in at .007 the day before a certain unnamed dog themed investment coin went parabolic over %150. With this in mind im feelin ballsy and willing to throw my shit at the wall and say my next money shot is going to be the company Go Health. 



 First this is thier 2020 4th quarter earnings. 

GO HEALTH : GOCO
Is a website/app that acts as a broker service to guide customers looking for health care plans with a current focus on medicare. The process of picking out health care plans is kind of a pain in the ass if your not getting it through work, Especially if your getting through the government and even further if your elderly. This company releaves these problems by highly training brokers in their own systems and feeding the brokers clients for personal 1v1 attention to guide them through and set up their new health insurance plans. With a focus on the elderly you can see where a company like this would help in being able to provide relieve/value. Because of that value customers are already willing to pay a premium but by taking advantage of mass they have go health had the ability to charge less premium than traditional standards. With their focus in government funded healthcare and fast joe now at the wheel there is no where to go but up. They have been in business for about 20 years and hold about 70 percent of a current un-realized market. They most recently have started to heavily invest back into the company since the biden win and i believe are going to try carving out a massive part of the 30 billion online health care market during this new admissestransation and are currently trading at 10 dollars a share. Go health went public late last summer and my guess is, had an early investors cashing in and that has made this bad boy go on sale. Listen to the earnings call linked above. Its just under hour long and you will understand what this company is about to do. Testicles.

7. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.

The latest short interest information from general market analysis companies are dated as of 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock had a dividend payout on 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82 (The shorts must cover that as well), so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC.

You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to reach it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride.

24,m5dd7d,"This is a follow-up post to a previous DD I posted on GE. This was the previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2j3z8/ge_might_be_doing_a_18_reverse_stock_split/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I‚Äôll summarize my main hypothesis right now because in the last post I think I may not have been clear enough:
I believe GE is in the midst of a resurgence due to recent decisions made by their new CEO, and basically any position held long (late this year minimum) is going to appreciate in value significantly, which is why I initially invested in GE. Recently it was announced that a 1:8 reverse stock split would take place, which caused a dip in the stock price; sentiment around this has obviously been negative. However, I think this is generally a good move on their part given the situation the company finds itself in, and as investors, I think there are some good opportunities that could arise from GE‚Äôs floated shares being reduced by 87.5%, as would be the case with a 1:8 reverse split.

Now I‚Äôll move on to the more recent developments.

Since the reverse split announcement, GE dipped a bit and I bought the dip (increased my position about 50% in both calls and shares). This dip was expected, because generally reverse splits are seen as more negative than a regular stock split for a couple reasons (we can discuss in the comments if anyone needs more info on that). I‚Äôm still very bullish on GE and feel the reverse split is a good thing, as evidenced by my buying the dip. Here are some thoughts that I had since the last post.

1. The stock has already begun recovering from the dip incurred by the split announcement. Since there isn‚Äôt a date set in stone yet, there‚Äôs still a chance they‚Äôll change their mind. This would be a very slim chance of course. The only factor I think that could spur such a reversal would be upward price movement. The main benefit I see here for myself/anyone else with a position in GE is that the market has already priced in the split, so naturally the opposite price movement would occur if suddenly the threat of a reverse split was lifted.

2. GE isn‚Äôt a heavily shorted stock at present, not because it doesn‚Äôt have problems (big debt for instance), but because the price has been so low and stable for so long that there isn‚Äôt much benefit to shorting it. The reverse split will open up a lot of downward potential for short sellers to try to take advantage of, but with the 87.5% reduction in float, short sellers would be at great risk of getting squeezed.

3. Even if short sellers aren‚Äôt interested, scarcity of shares could drive the stock price up at an accelerated pace. Basically the trend that GE has been enjoying for several months now could be amplified.

**Ebang International Holdings Inc.** is a bokchain company that has been under the radar for the past while. I strongly believe that it has significantly more potential for gains than the ones everyone knows about like RIOT, and I‚Äôd like to share some reasons why. But first, a bit of background about the company.

**Ebang International Holdings Inc Background:**

EBON was founded during the earliest days of corn way back in 2010, by entrepreneur and computer scientist Dong Hu. They built miners and at one point captured 11% of the corn mining market. They are now launching a corn exchange which is set to officially launch on March 31st.

**Why EBON is undervalued compared to other corn related stocks:**

So in August and September they were talking about how they were gonna launch a corn exchange which made it hit a high of 15 dollars, and that was when corn was only at 10k. Except people lost confidence in Ebang‚Äôs plans cause they kept talking about the exchange but it wasn‚Äôt launching, so investors got impatient and it sold off. Now that they will begin beta-testing their exchange tomorrow and launch in two weeks, I except the stock to rocket back to 15 dollars and beyond.

Also, there was barely English news about this company, so it‚Äôs mainly driven by Chinese investors who invest in US-listed stocks. I probably wouldn‚Äôt know anything about this stock if I couldn‚Äôt read Chinese. Due to the press releases that the company is doing, now there‚Äôs more English news on this company, and I expect US retail investor buying to drastically increase.

It also hasn't pumped nearly as much as other miners, and has a lot more room to the upside.

**EBON‚Äôs upcoming plans:**

In addition to launching the exchange, they also plan on making mining farms, which given their technology they can easily achieve.

*‚ÄúOur upcoming corn exchange will accelerate the Company‚Äôs development in the financial technology industry. In addition to establishing a digital asset financial service platform, the Company will also explore other business opportunities in establishing mining farms and corn mining to optimize the structure of the global corn platform as well as our offerings in the bokchain industry value chain.‚Äù*

‚Äî ¬≠CEO Dong Hu

They used to be huge in mining but like most of the other mining companies like CAN, they stopped their operations in the corn bear market, as mining wasn‚Äôt profitable when corn price was so low. Now they are getting their mining operations back and I expect them to be even bigger in this field than before.

59,m5ds8l,"This isn't advice, I'm not telling you what to do. I am dumb. Don't  listen to me. I'm new at this. I had 3 calls at $7 strike and 15 shares at $6.93, sold those, I made like a \~30% return. Derped 4 new calls at $8 strike for $0.43 expiring 6/18. I think stonk keep going up. This is probably full of mistakes so please help me fix them and tell me why I'm a dumbass if you think I'm a dumbass so I can get better at making tendies. Here's my thinks: 

$TWO is a REIT that does mortgage backed securities.  

A few  nights ago, I was looking  through insider buying data from OpenInsider  and I stumbled onto a  company called Two Harbors. Their CEO had just  purchased \~$230,000  worth of stock. ( [http://openinsider.com/top-officer-purchases-of-the-week](http://openinsider.com/top-officer-purchases-of-the-week) )

I   was interested in that because I've been looking stocks that had   dropped due to covid but hadn't bounced back yet. $TWO is definitely   that kind of company. ( [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWO?p=TWO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWO?p=TWO) )

They had some insider sales, but there have been none since the rally started in Feb. Only buys. 

 I  did a whole bunch of reading about the company, and what I found most useful was a transcript of their quarterly earnings call over at  s33 king  alpha... which is soft paywalled so I can't post here. 

TLDR: Since they specialize in  residential mortgage they figured  they'd get buttrammed by people who  couldn't pay their mortgage, but  that ended up being not nearly as bad  as they expected. As a play to  survive market volitility, they sold off  risky but profitable  investments and stacked fat piles of tendies in a  bunker. They lost a bunch of money all at once from getting too anal retentive and fearing the apocalypse, but they ended up not using those tendies for survival, and are now ready to  unleash those tendies to  turn them into more tendies.

Their 2020 Annuals sucked:

 But  when you drill down to their quarterly, you see that the losses  were  isolated to one bad quarter, and their quarterly earnings are  already  back to pre-covid numbers... but their stock price is only  about 1/2 of  where it was pre-covid... **AND THEY'RE SITTING ON A BUNCH OF CASH!** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7925kslno4n61.png?width=311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01d910e7ed88083e6881e488852d4e3ca11ccc10

 

According to Whale Watch ([https://whalewisdom.com/stock/two](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/two)), 85.71% of hedgies have increased their position in the last quarter. 63.04% is held by institutions:

OutValueBlackrock Inc. 26,951,349, 9.85%

Vanguard Group, Inc. (The) 24,565,439, 8.98%

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 9,652,081, 3.53%

Wells Fargo &amp; Company 8,623,911, 3.15%

Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC 6,871,391, 2.51%

If it follows the last two month trend, it could really, really take off by this summer... so I bought some.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not interested in REITs, but I'd love to make money from people who are interested in REITs as they continue to slowly get back into this stock and drive the price up to where it was pre-covid. So far so good. I think there's room left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm derpy as fuck at technical analysis, but you can see the bottoms going up and the tops going up too. All month the resistance lines have become the new support lines. The current trend line is just a litter steeper than the Feb trend line.

Oh, and did I mention the options are dirt cheap? Because they're dirt fucking cheap. But that's just like... my opinion man... 

I think the rest of the month will looks like this but its also just my opinion:

96,m5ed71,"I‚Äôve been investing in the ASX for several years now. For many years I have been focusing on young biotechs.

These companies go through at least 3 phases of clinical trials before their products make it on the shelf. 

More often than not. Large pharma move in and buy the IP to the new and promising products or they partner with the company by buying in. 

Most companies that have successful products don‚Äôt make it to phase 3 alone. If their assets show potential in trials then they are scooped up. 

The problem is that large pharma use trading tactics including bots to suppress the price on the lead up to an acquisition or partnership so they can save on the deal. 

Such is happening right now with Imugene IMU: ASX.
A biotech creating immunotherapy vaccines to fight cancer. They can create an immune response to trigger your own body to fight disease. 

Imugene is current valued at 500M AUD and is on the cusp of a TO or partnership but is held up by a wall of selling and bot trading.

The competition for their key product is Genentech‚Äôs Herceptin. This drug produces sales of over 6B annually. And is constantly outperformed by Imugene‚Äôs HER-Vaxx. 

Within the next 12 months Imugene will be worth at least 100% greater than what it is now. A partnership is imminent. Though profits will be hindered by large corporation‚Äôs greed. 

I urge anyone to look into Imugene IMU : ASX via the web. There is a large community on [Hotcopper](https://hotcopper.com.au/asx/imu/?keywords=IMU)
