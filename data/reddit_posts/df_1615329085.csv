0,m1i7zl,"A thought came into my mind while watching some A+ BDSM (Summer Brielle - you're welcome): how many people on  this board will zoom past the moon and come back burning the atmosphere still asking themselves 'are we there yet?' -- so the idea of the 1 Minute Millionaire came to me. 

As someone who's started his trading career in the choppy seas of 2011 on the SPY, i'm used to seeing wild swings, but nothing I've seen so far even compares to GME. 

Let's take a look at the action around the ATH: 

*Processing img zdg5hu78w2m61...*

These are 30-minute candles and the take-away is a somewhat short lunch would have been enough to miss the top, never mind taking a #2 that refuses to cooperate. 

It feels ironic that the people wanting this thing to moon might be asking for more than they can handle; by the time Reddit sentiment confirms the mooning, it'll probably already be 50% retraced easy, probably a lot more. 

What I'm suggesting here is basically put some alarms where you think you'd want to get out. At least that if not a take profit, which I get are very frowned upon. FOMO is one thing, having money slip through your fingers is way worse. 

What are your thoughts?

9,m1i97z,Insg is in the 5g business and is a leader in the industry. They make 5g hotspots. The recently had their earnings and the price tanked 40% for a barley missed eps. Their revenue grew by 64%  which is great. The reason it tanked so bad was timing of their earnings which was during the tech sell off. And people might have overreacted that their 4g revenue is slowing down but that’s because the are investing more into 5g which makes sense. It is way oversold rn. They have contracts with T-Mobile and Verizon. My brother got a wifi router from school during covid and it was an inseego.

I just thought I'd reach out and thankyou for steering me in the direction of the smartest financial advice I've ever received from the internet.

I just found out I have my first baby on the way and the extra couple of hundred dollars I've made in GME can be held for the next 7 months as a small term savings account for the little one.

But again Thank You. I'm from Australia and It has been excellent to wake up in the morning and see the ridiculous jumps in price and it is an absolute wild ride.

13,m1i9wx,"In [this article](https://popular.info/p/you-helped-buy-the-most-expensive) it is described how Ken Griffin bought a $238 million penthouse in NYC, along with other homes in London and Chicago. The article further talks about how Citadel profited from taxpayer bailouts, cashing in at least $200 million plus (no other exact figures stated). 

In 2009 (ONE YEAR AFTER the 2008 CRISIS) Griffin had the audacity to pay himself the lumpy sum of $900 MILLION salary, after Citadel being on the verge of bankruptcy just ONE F\*KING YEAR AGO! Citadel declined these figures, according to the article linked above they were published by the New York Times at the time. On top of that, he raised his pay up to 1.7 BILLION $ in 2015.

Read the article for yourself and do your own DD and look up other sources. But for me this is enough reason to HODL my lumpy single digit number of GME shares forever.

In case the discussion flair is the wrong choice PLEASE LET ME KNOW and I will change it accordingly.

$SEARS baby

Their Rep said that it most likely won’t be available for us peasants to buy until like 10am at the earliest. And noon at the latest. . 

He said there won’t be a stock profile on it until end of day (meaning if you search the ticker. Nothing will come up. No charts. Etc etc).  

But if you enter a, “quick order,” or a, “snap order,” to buy shares, that order will execute. And the quick order will have the bid/ask, volume, etc etc on it - but the brokerage won’t have the company profile created for 24-48 hours. 

He said that options will be available based on the OCC &amp; the demand as they see fit. (The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is an organization that acts as both the issuer and guarantor for options and futures contracts.) and usually options become available anywhere from 3 business days - up to 2 weeks, post IPO. 

I spent 2hours on hold to get this stupid small amount of super useful info, so you apes don’t have to.
