Been posting hoping that this day would come and first posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6b1et/why_a_deal_with_amazon_makes_united_natural_foods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Well today we can put our fears behind us as Amazon is committed to use UNFI till 2027. Earnings are next week and you can check out the play [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwyjf4/the_preearnings_play_unfi_to_the_moon_dd_and/).

""This extension allows both companies to maintain focus on what is most important: continuing to meet the growing demand for healthy food at home as we navigate through the global pandemic,” said Steven L. Spinner, UNFI’s CEO.

53,lxmf50,"Let me tell you all about a little company called Pubmatic $PUBM.

**TLDR;**

\- Secular Tailwinds in Programmatic Advertising Space &amp; Connected TV - Very Good- Solid Financials - Very Good- Valuation - UNDERVALUED LIKE CRAZY- Short Interest - Someone look it up, but it's anywhere from 30-80%**- Good Industry + Solid Financials + Undervalued + High Short Interest = VERY GOOD**

**INTRODUCTION**

Pubmatic is in the programmatic advertising space and is a supply-side platform (SSP) where it works with publishers to maximize their advertising revenue and if you don't know much about that space, let me tell you about three other companies that have benefited tremendously from the secular tailwinds in this space: The Trade Desk ($TTD), Magnite ($MGNI), Acuity Ads ($ACUIF)

The Trade Desk, Magnite, Acuity Ads have all benefited tremendously from the big shift to programmatic advertising (bunch of ads that show up on various websites based on your interests) and most of all: Connected Television (CTV) where legacy cable advertisers are shifting their ad dollars to move into digital advertising within televisions (i.e. Hulu, Roku, IMDB, etc.).

There are **BIG dollars moving from legacy TV to digital TV and traditional advertising to programmatic advertising.**

Just look at their stock prices in the past 1 year/3-years:

TTD: 150% / 1,122%MGNI: 317% / 2502%ACUIF: 1390% / 1454%

Anyway going back to Pubmatic. This little company IPO'd in December 2020 and basically for most of December didn't have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of December.

Then come January and February Pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing Pubmatic's potential in this space, but the real reckoning came when they announced earnings on February 23 where they not only beat earnings, THEY **CRUSHED earnings** and they did one even better, they gave **SOLID guidance for Q1** and FY 2021 despite having little visibility into the back half of 2021.

**FINANCIALS**

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue (In $ Ms)||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|
|2018|||||$99.3|
|2019|$23.6|$27.4|$28.5|$34.4|$113.9|
|2020|$28.3|$26.4|$37.8|$56.2|$148.7|
|2021|$38-40|||||

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue % YoY|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 vs. 2019|19.9%|\-3.7%|32.6%|**63.4%**|
|2021 vs. 2020|**41.3%**||||

Look at that Revenue **ACCELERATION** from 19.9% to 63.4% by Q4 and guiding for 41.3% which they will easily beat by at least a few points if not more (most companies guide with some padding).

**They are also GAAP PROFITABLE**. Most tech companies are Non-GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation which cuts into earnings, but this little company is PROFITABLE already.

Their Net Income Margin for Q4 was 33.5% which is incredible and for the year they finished with a 17.9% Net Income Margin despite COVID beating the crap out of this business in Q2.

This is a company that is executing brilliantly and has done so profitability as well. They also have really happy employees and a bunch of reviews too: [https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm)

**VALUATION**

When it comes to tech companies, given their lack of GAAP profitability, they are often valued on an Enterprise Value to Sales ratio (EV/S).

&amp;#x200B;

|Company Name|TTM EV/S|Q4 Growth Rate|Q1 Guidance|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The Trade Desk|44.8|\+48%|\+35%|$37.8 B|
|Magnite|26.1|20% (Pro Forma)|\+20-40% (Pro-forma)|$5.9 B|
|Pubmatic|**18**|\+63.4%|\+41.3%|$2.6 B|

Pubmatic is growing significantly faster than The Trade Desk and Magnite and has a multiple that is at least 30%+ less. This makes no sense! How is a company growing faster than its peers that offers a product that has a ton of traction, and executing brilliantly valued so much less? If they were to get an equal multiple, this stock would be trading in the $90+ range at least.

**SHORT INTEREST &amp; VOLUME**

Now it gets interesting. I have no idea if the sources I'm reviewing are correct, but this is what I'm seeing:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)

It shows % Short Float at **32.2%** which seems like a lot to me.

Another article per TheStreet.com shows short float % at: **80.3%!!!!**

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm\_ven=YAHOO](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO)

I have no idea which source is correct, all I know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results. Perhaps it's due to it being a new IPO or something, but the stock skyrocketed to $76 before cratering down to $52 due to the recent market volatility and I wouldn't doubt that the high % short float, whatever it is, is causing that to some degree.

Regardless, it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze. If $RKT could double with a short float % of 38% or so and it being a $30 B company prior to the squeeze, I would anticipate a company that is &lt; $3 B in market cap and doesn't have a ton of trading volume everyday, could see some potential uptick.

**Wrapping Up**

I think Pubmatic is a great company. They seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with HUGE secular tailwinds. I anticipate this company will do very well by its own, but given how much short interest there is, this could be an interesting play too.
