14,m4wli4,"Yesterday I made a post explaining calls, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/).  In it, I said I'd explain puts later.  It's later, so I'm explaining them below.  I also had a lot of people ask me further questions about calls, so after I talk about puts, I'm going to cover some of that info to clear up confusion.  Assuming this goes as well as the last one, maybe I'll do one more post about options, in which I'll talk about writing calls/puts, and maybe go into a little more detail about the Greeks and how options are priced and valued.  We'll see. 

Moving forward, if you didn't read yesterday's post, then the first thing you should do is read that, because I'm going to use terminology and refer to concepts that were explained in that post.

**WHAT IS A PUT OPTION**

If a call is a bet that that a stock is going to go up, then a put option (hereafter referred to as a ""put"") is a bet that a stock is going to go down.  Like a call, a put is contract involving 100 shares.  However, instead of giving you the ability to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price, a put option gives you the ability to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price.

Example:  Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think it is going to tank.  You can buy a put option for $100, and if the price of GME drops below $100, you're ITM.

**HOW DO PUTS WORK?**

The same way as calls.  You buy them the same way, you pay for them the same way (premiums), you sell them the same way if you don't want to exercise (more on this later, as selling your contracts was the most common question I got yesterday), and they are impacted by theta decay and IV the same way.

One key difference is the exercising of a put option, which we'll look at in a second.  Other than that, there isn't much more to put here.  If you understand calls, then you understand puts.  Beyond exercising, the only real difference is that you are betting on the price to go down instead of up.

**CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE ANYWAY?  I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID I UNDERSTOOD CALLS.**

Sure.

Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think the the hedgies are winning and the squeeze is over.  Or maybe you think that the squeeze is going to squoze next week, and after that the price is going to drop once everyone takes their profits.  Regardless, by 3/26, you think that the price will drop back down to $40 or lower.

So you buy an $8.32 GME 100p 3/26.  Do we remember what that means and how much it costs?  It means you spent $832 for the right to sell 100 shares of GME for $100 on or before 3/26.

Now you wait.  If 3/26 comes and goes and the price never drops, then your option expires OTM.

But if you were correct and the price does drop below $100, then you are ITM and have a choice to make.  You can sell the contract or exercise it.

**OK, SO HOW IS EXERCISING A PUT DIFFERENT THAN EXERCISING A CALL**

If you choose to exercise a call, you have one option: buy the shares.  When exercising a put, you have three options.

1.  If you already have 100 shares of GME (maybe you missed the peak and are holding a bag), then exercising the put is as easy as making the option writer buy your shares.  You give them 100 shares of GME, and they give you $10,000 ($100/share x 100 shares).  

2.  If you don't have 100 shares of GME, then you can buy 100 shares for whatever the stock price is (if it dropped all the way to $40, then you'd buy them for $40) and then sell them to the option writer for $100 share.  That's dumb.  Don't do that.

3.  If you think it has farther to fall (and you have a margin account), you can enter a short position.  You borrow 100 shares and sell them to the option writer for $100, then you wait and buy them back later to replace the shares you borrowed.  That's big dumb.  Don't do that either.

Really, though, you should be selling your contracts instead of exercising, because exercising contracts throws away any extrinsic value you may have built (see below).  Plus, you probably don't want and can't afford 100 shares of whatever stock you have options on.

**THE PART WHERE I TALK ABOUT SELLING YOUR OPTION CONTRACTS AND ANSWER SOME COMMON QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LAST TIME.  I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUTS AND CALLS BOTH HERE.**

*First, let's talk about value and taking advantage of that value to sell for profit.*

We talked about this a little yesterday, but you need to make sure you understand that your option has value from when you buy it until it expires, and that you can use that value to make money.  Does that mean it has value even when it's OTM?  Yes, even OTM options have value (see: extrinsic value from yesterday).  Why?  Because people buy OTM contracts.  In fact, OTM contracts can even make you money while still OTM.  Did you buy a $400c when the stock price was $100?  If the stock price gets to $350, you may be OTM, but your $400c contract can be worth more now than it was when you bought it (assuming there is time left before expiration and theta isn't killing you).  But how can you buy an OTM contract and then sell that same contract for profit when it is still OTM?  Remember the premiums.  When people buy options, they pay the option seller a premium to buy that contract.  The premium on a way OTM contract is going to be very cheap.  The premium on a ""near the money"" contract that is that has time to spare is going to be higher.  If you buy that contract when it is way OTM and sell it when it is near the money, the price the buyer gives you could be higher than the price you paid to the seller, which equals profit.  The same is true of a put.  If you buy a $100p when the share price is $400, you'll be able to sell that contract for a profit if the price drops to $150 (again, assuming you aren't running out of time.  Time is a big deal.  Seriously.  I'll talk about that later).

On the other hand, an OTM option that is running out of time and not even close to strike (or hasn't move appreciably since bought) isn't going to have as much value as it did when you bought, and any sale would be at a loss.  But remember that you can still sell it even if it is losing.

ITM options always have value because they are worth the difference between the stock price and strike (remember intrinsic value?), which can't be zero if the stock is trading above strike.

*So when can I sell my contract?*

Anytime.  You can sell it ITM, OTM, or ATM (at the money, which means the stock is trading at the strike price.  I don't think we talked about ATM options yesterday).  Are you approaching expiration and the stock is trading sideways and you don't think you're going to hit the strike before time runs out?  You can sell it and cut your losses.  Did the stock spike deep ITM but you think it's going to crash back down?  Sell that thing and realize some profit.

*Who determines the price of a contract?  Who determines the premiums?  Do I set the premiums when I sell my contract?*

The premium/value of a contract is determined by an arcane combination of factors, including time to exercise, strike price, stock price, volatility, and others.  There is a lot of Greek involved.  There may be actual magic involved, too.  Either way, the price is set for you and you don't have to worry about it.  

*But who's going to buy my contract?  If nobody ever wants to execute, then who ends up with all the calls?  If nobody has shares to sell, who ends up with all the puts?*

I was surprised at how many people asked me this question.  The short answer is that it doesn't matter.  Someone will buy your contract.  The medium answer is that it could be individuals, institutions, or the market maker absorbing the trade if no one else will.  Regardless, calls/puts that weren't offset will be exercised by some entity or other.  In the case of calls, if they didn't want the shares, they'll just sell them.  In the case of puts, if they didn't have the shares to sell, then they'll buy them.

*If I sell my contract to someone else, am I on the hook when they exercise?*

No.  The writer, or the person who created the contract and first sold it, is the only person who will be on the end of an exercise.  If you write a call that goes ITM, then you can get assigned and have to cough up some shares.  If you bought a call and then sold it when it went ITM, then you don't have to sell any shares to cover.  If you want to learn about writing calls/puts, then maybe I'll do that next time.

*What if I don't sell my ITM option when it expires?*

It depends on the brokerage and whether or not you have a margin account.  Your brokerage will either exercise them, sell the contract for you, or let it expire.

*So what is the deal with time, then?  Or, when should I sell my contract?*

Time, which is referred to and measured as theta, plays a big part in the extrinsic value (or potential, as we talked about yesterday) of an option.  The closer you get to expiration, the faster theta decay (the loss of value due to time) is going to increase, and the faster you are going to start losing value.  In fact, there can be instances in which the stock price goes up, but your option value still goes down because theta decay is eroding value faster than the other pricing factors are increasing value.  For this reason, you generally don't want to wait until expiration to sell a call, and should have a plan to do so earlier.  Theta Decay is real.

*So when is ""earlier?""*

There are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell.

**IN CONCLUSION**

If you think a stock is going to go up, buy a call.  If you think it's going to go down, buy a put.  Sell your contracts.  Don't exercise them.  Don't wait until the last minute.  you have nothing to lose but your chains premiums.

That's most of what I can think of to say about the basics of buying/selling options.  Is there more to it than that?  Yes, but adding it in here will make it too long and too technical, and more articles that are too long and too technical aren't going to help people who are struggling to get the basics.  As I said above, I might do one last options post about writing contracts and maybe covering the Greeks.  We'll see.  Regardless, it won't be today or tomorrow.  Maybe next weekend.

This metric tells the time of arrival on the moon from the perspective of the ape-likes. It is ever changeing, but we all know the exact time will end up being 4:20:69,00 USDollars.

DD = Diamond Dicking
This term applies to content posted on this sub that aims to erect the primate male's genital to extreme degrees. Typically this is done by means of numbers, colours, charts, rockets, diamonds and such, and is a confirmatory agent of masculinity.
Example: 
""Have you read the GME DD this morning? Damn, that was more effective than my wife's boyfriend's mother's sister's brother. Totally tingled my jingles."" 

Short = half-cover legwear.
This piece of clothing often reflects a lack of interest in or respect for the current situation, event or stock. 
Example: 
""Melvin's wife's boyfriend came in shorts to my boyfriend's wedding yesterday. Do you think he was mocking them?""
- ""Don't think so. Maybe he was expecting some high school swimming pool party. But, boy! -- was he surprised. And very much ashamed, I can imagine.""

Naked short: an elusive and potentially revealing short
This is a special kind of short. The wearer bluffs people into believing he is wearing a skin-coloured short with a penis drawn on it, in order to express his disregard to the fullest. However, in reality the short in question is actually not a short at all, rather a whiteboard-marker drawing, effectively leaving the wearer naked to those that notice.
Example: 
""Wow man, Melvin was no doubt aggrevating my wife's boyfriend's this time! Those shorts were unacceptable truly.""
- ""Uhm, you don't really believe those were actual shorts, do you? ""
""Of course i do! I mean, there's just no way his real penis would be that tiny, lol. Right? Right???""

- ""These fucking FUD posts again.. *sigh*

69,m4wwip,"Note I eat crayons so I have no clue what I’m talking about. This is purely a guess, I ate too much green crayons this week.

So we all know how the gamma squeeze helped propel what we saw last week. Unless the shorts begin to cover (the interest on the shares they’ve borrowed earlier may be cheap vs covering), the market makers will probably sell their shares they bought to hedge their options they’ve wrote. What does this mean? Possibly a reversal of what we saw last week for the March 12 calls, when they dump their hedged stock purchases for profit.

How we can play this? Hold on your GME shares but buy puts, also buy the dip because if they attempt a dump, we can get shares for cheap and cause the price to increase and then they’ll have to rebuy for March 19 and future for hedging.",Gamma squeeze GME. Be careful.,1.0,1615734935,mlamping
