Are we entering the climactic third act, wherein the hero puts away his more rational instruments and relies on his instincts instead, to drop a load into the pipes of Death Star machinery for moon-sized fireworks/explosive diarrhea? Look, let me put on my Qanon-brand tinfoil hat for a second.

Battle lines at 260. As soon as we crossed it, we started rocketing, shooting up to 350 when the, ahem, ""short ladder attack,"" occurred, dipping to below 200, then settling again near 260. Look at closing and AH prices. See: cat waiting to pounce tweet from DFV, indicating something significant we're watching/waiting for...? On the verge of? It's 25 secs long! On the cusp of the magical 26! (I said it was going to get Qanon-y.) Ryan Cohen tweet - shit's about to go down? Squeeze? Clogged toilets - i.e. fail-to-locate shares/liquidity issues?

Look at this:

Also see the gathering storm at the battleground strikes, the OI in way-OTM  call options.

Ihor (S3 Partners) says the squeeze is still on.
MSM articles highlight the power of the gamma squeeze and options leverage, if you want confirmation bias of the power of retail.

Put all these things together and what do you get?

No, I'm asking. Seriously. Like, what does it all mean? I don't know, I eat crayons. I melt them into paste in my mouth and collect it in a jar to see what color it becomes. When we get a green day, I pour out a little into a cocktail glass as a reward a sip it like a fancy man.

Lord Cohen, a true god amongst insects, has spoken once again. This time though, I see it as a friendly warning to retail traders like us. In fact I think this tweet was directly for us. What better character to represent WSB, a self-proclaimed community of retards and ne'er-do-wells, than Harry from dumb and dumber? 

In the scene Harry had ingested the MOAL (mother of all laxatives), Turbo Lax, and had to expel an unprecedented amount of shit while he was a guest at a girls house. And my god it was not a smooth process. Here's what happened - when he first felt the shit knocking it hit him suddenly like a fucking brick wall. He quickly and desperately grasped around to find the bathroom door, where he voraciously dropped his pants and LET LOOSE. It was a euphoric, and almost orgasmic experience. The look on his face for about 5 seconds was that of pure pleasure. You know what I'm talking about. Once he was done, a look of horror came on his face as he realized where he was and the aftermath he would have to deal with. His effort to open the window was too little too late, and the toilet did not work. The look of horror on his face intensified as the scene began to cut to Lloyd's stupid face and evil laugh.

So what is this supposed to mean for GME holders? Well, I believe Cohen was trying to warn us retards to not be like Harry. When the GME hype quickly set in, much like a potent laxative, retards from all over the world scrambled (are still scrambling?) to quickly and almost desperately grab shares before the big ""explosion"". With the squeeze in motion, we will see pure euphoric pleasure as our assholes are ripped wide open by the most epic squeeze of our lifetimes. It will be easy to get caught up in this euphoria, with no regard for consequences or what happens next, until it is over. Once it is over, horror will be on the faces of the bagholders who are left with their shit all over the place while the evil laugh of those who profited is heard in the distance. This was seen with the last squeeze, as many people here bought at the top and were left holding at $40.

Let's be honest, we like to think RC knows everything that's going to happen and is trying to give us  hints about what will happen next. I don't think this is true. While RC has a better idea than any of us, nobody knows what will happen next. The only thing that we do know for sure is if there is a massive squeeze, there will be massive bagholders left on the other side. RC knows this, and knows that at this time we are gamestop's biggest supporters. At this moment in time, we love gamestop (and like the stock). If we were to become bagholders, gamestop may forever be painted in a negative light and will have lost it's most loyal customer base. At the end of this, RC and gang wants retail to profit and continue their love for gamestop. I'm sure they would much prefer and slow and methodical rise with a slower more deliberate squeeze that will reward all shareholders. Instead of desperately grabbing the nearest doorknob to find the closest toilet, Cohen may be suggesting that you take your time to find a working toilet and slowly deliver a steaming hot deuce onto the faces short sellers.

How do you protect yourself here? What is the best strategy moving forward? Well, I leave that up to the retards in the comments. All I know is that we need to stay vigilant and be careful out there. Instead of YOLO'ing all my money in at once, I have been slowly adding shares to even out the volatility.

Obviously none of this is investment advice and his highly speculative. Honestly I just banged my head on a keyboard and this was the result.

They have been working hard on EV Semi Trucks and Autonomous Driving tech, and for those that don't know, Paccar is the Fortune 500 parent company of brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt.

So one of the largest (if not largest) semi truck manufacturers in the world.

It's up to 1% of the ARKK fund now. Cathie's been buying a stodgy old company that no one cares about? Oh wait, they are actually making autonomous EV semis and have the production capability to do so? Hmm. They are also a profitable company that did 18bn in sales last year.

How come no one has noticed this?

Price Target: 

I believe there’s upside to the current average sell-side 2022 EPS estimates ($6.71 today, and I’m looking for $7-plus), but I’m reluctant to pay more than 14x-15x peak EPS, so $110 is about as high as I would go without a good argument for materially higher volumes in 2022 or 2023. My EV/EBITDA approach is based more on margins and returns (where PACCAR stands out positively), but at 11x my 2022 EBITDA estimate I get a fair value of around $105.

SEC allowing hedgefunds to solely run on IBM Watson like software that specifies trade routing systems with data on **trading patterns** while also using that data to make their own trades for profit.

read that last line again.

That is how hedgefunds manipulate and control the ""**FREE MARKET**""

They play the upside and downside of trades, pin the price, and make money both ways by setting algorithms.

the manipulation - has been blatant, glaring and obvious
