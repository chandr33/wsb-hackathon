*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is my opinion.

Tl;dr

RADA specializes in military defense radar technologies and is growing and profitable as of 2020, with Uncle Sam 
(DoD) already working with them, plus their radar/sensor technologies potentially used in autonomous driving/piloting, the company should have a bright future. In another note, ARK IZRL has been increasing their position for the past 3 weeks, the current market cap is only 600M, it won’t be long before Cathie’s fans double or triple that number.

RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. is a world leading defense technology company dedicated to proprietary radar solutions and avionics systems.
The company is a global pioneer of mini-tactical radars for active military protection, counter-drone applications, critical infrastructure protection and border surveillance.

RADA’s Products

RADA’s cutting-edge software defined, 4D AESA pulse Doppler radars enable lifesaving, mission-critical capabilities for the maneuver force.
With simultaneous multi-mission capability, our radar systems provide real-time 360° Situation Awareness for operational superiority.

APS, VPS &amp; HFD  

RADA advanced compact, lightweight radar sits at the heart of combat proven Active Protection Systems (APS), Vehicle Protection Systems (VPS) and Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) applications, multi-mission AESA 4D pulse Doppler systems rapidly detect, track and classify all relevant threats – small arms, RPGs, ATGMs and tank rounds.

SHORAD &amp; C-UAS

RADA’s family of advanced radars are the system-of-choice for Mobile Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) systems.
Providing enhanced fire control and air surveillance capabilities, the mature radar systems detect and track all types of aerial threats including Nano drones and short-range indirect fire.

C-RAM

RADA’s proven radars are deployed by leading armed forces for Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) Sense &amp; Warn missions. The systems detect, track and classify all types of elevated fire.

Hemispheric Surveillance

RADA’s vehicle-mounted or static radar platforms provide superior hemispheric surveillance, and simultaneous detection and tracking of aerial and ground threats.
Offering comprehensive perimeter and border surveillance, the advanced systems detect, track and classify intruders: small and slow aircraft, drones, vehicles, vessels, pedestrians, and more.

Avionics Systems (DVDR)

RADA is a leading provider of advanced airborne Digital Video and Data Recorders (DVDR) proven in the most demanding combat environments.
The company’s wide range of fully-mature solid-state digital recorders, cameras, and debriefing systems are recognized as the best value solutions for aerial deployment.

Current Clients

Supplying a global customer base that includes the armed forces of more than 30 countries, our advanced radars are deployed on hundreds of battle-platforms of the IDF, IAF, US Army, USMC, USAF, US SOF and more.

RADA USA awarded $19M in DoD orders for the delivery of the Air Surveillance Radar Systems(https://radausa.com/news)

Consumer Market Potentials 

RADA’s US subsidiaries including:

RADA Technologies LLC
RADA Innovations LLC
RADA Sensors Inc

So far, I can’t find any products that will be used by the mass consumer market, but with the rise of autonomous driving and autonomous piloting, the reality of robotics will eventually be able to identify  and communicate with each other (especially while moving).
The potential application of RADA’s technologies could be enormous, I think that’s why ARK keeps buying this stock for the past 3 weeks.

Financials

Highlights of Full Year 2020 (https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/rada-announces-record-q4-full-102800152.html)
* Record revenues of $76.2 million, up 72% year-over-year;
* Gross margin of 37%, up from 36% in 2019;
* Net income of $5.6 million, compared to $2.3 million net loss in 2019;
* EBITDA of $9.7 million, compared to $0.4 million in 2019;
* Year-end net cash position of $35.8 million.

Institutional Backing

RADA’s top holders are not the biggest names, however, with Renaissance Technologies LLC and ARK IZRL[ Link ](https://ark-funds.com/israel-etf)  leading the way and keep buying, it’s safe to say the company and its technologies are solid.

&amp;#x200B;

These past two days of the GME stock price has probably been confusing for many, and the health of the stock is in question. Therefore lets analyze the stock like a doctor, that is to say, how can we treat it and more importantly how can we make money in doing so?

Looking at the chart we can immediately notice one important finding. A delta wave before the QRS-complex. Let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME Chart with superimposed ECG pattern](https://preview.redd.it/rgdjzq50dhm61.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382d0cbddb34860e38c4909bb2dd4d40dd5600e8)

A delta wave preceding the QRS-complex in an ECG is a classical finding in Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome, a rare heart condition with potential for life threatening arrhythmias. 

Here is an ECG finding in another WPW patient for comparison:

&amp;#x200B;

[ECG finding in a patient with WPW](https://preview.redd.it/2qsz4rnhdhm61.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9f888f37a73ad3282c9d045b3b891a342d08e7a)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, patients with WPW typically carry a risk of developing a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Some patients however can go into **VFib**, which is a life threatening condition requiring urgent medical care ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2044547/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2044547/)) . 

# Let me illustrate:

&amp;#x200B;

[ECG finding in a patient in VFib](https://preview.redd.it/1pfk852cfhm61.jpg?width=1300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15127121b21c4d9ac70abdaa7b606141bd25f4e)

# Looking familiar?

&amp;#x200B;

[GME with classical ECG findings of VFib](https://preview.redd.it/7c8nusspfhm61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f7cd6d50743becaf4dc5389727c2dc2781bcf7)

Now, how do we treat it? 

This is where it gets technical, but bear with me. The underlying mechanism in WPW involves an accessory electrical conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles in the heart. Problems arise when this extra electrical pathway conduits electricity in the heart causing a rapid heart beat up to 300 beats per minute. Treatment typically consists of Amiodarone, a medication that stabilizes the heart rate and sold by **Mayne Pharma Group Limited** (ASX: MYX). I have yet to figure out exactly how to apply this information to the health of the GME stock however.",GME - Technical Analysis from a Cardiologists perspective,1.0,1615506594,Gabbexxify

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bunch of debit spreads on gme.

Positions:

3/12 245/250

3/19 195/200

3/19 240/250

4/23 200/205

1/20/2023  40/60

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm scared about is particularly that 2023 40/60.

I am worried with the volatility that my shorts will get exercised and then if the price drops suddenly I will be left bag holding.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have 25k to manually close the position.

&amp;#x200B;

Any real advice helps, I know I should have just bought the stock like an ape, I was trying to figure out how to beat up the HF's as much as possible tho.",GME PLEASE HELP,1.0,1615507094,Bravo5805

98,m34dvy," $TR is a company that is ROCK SOLID, opposite of the soft and chewy confectionery they produce. They have existed for over a hundred years and have weathered every economic depression since the Panic of 1896

Roll-based snacks are the future of food as we know it. There are several unique catalysts that can make Tootsie Roll a truly transformative company in the coming years.

Financials - Tootsie Roll has a fantastic balance sheet overall. It is sitting on a lot of cash and has increased its dividends for over 50 years. Future acquisitions and mergers could provide good growth prospects. Even better, there is the very real possibility that Tootsie could expand past the candy industry. Innovative technology start-ups could be bought with the over 200 million dollars that Tootsie has stowed away. Markets such as the EV sector are prime for this expansion.

Future Management - The current CEO and President is Ellen Gordon, who is 89 years old and may soon be replaced. A potential new CEO could turn things around for this company and disrupt the industry. Suppose Jack Ma ends up fleeing China in the future. Where better to end up than at $TR? The possibilities are endless.

When they go low, we go high. Tootsie gang, rise up.",Tootsie Roll is UNDERVALUED 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕,1.0,1615507141,EntertainmentDeep518
