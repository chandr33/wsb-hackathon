2,m1ehb4,"ZEST (Ecoark), is coming up soon to be a good play for those interested in seeing Walmart take an L. Eden, their program they use to track produce was stolen from Ecoark as a replica of their ZEST technologies. Walmart and Ecoark has a contract which used the ZEST technology to track said produce, until Walmart discarded their contract and came out with Eden directly after terminating the contract.  
The trial was set for June 2020, but was move to the end of March 2021 due to Cov-SAR. You can (an should always) do your own due diligence on the protrack website which shows the court documentation. With text messages between corporate leaders, and the timing of everything that came about of Eden, it seems as if Walmart had their hand in the cookie jar and was caught.   
Basically when the settlement occurs (which is the best way for Walmart to keep using Eden), the amount won get spread between stock holders  in their share price. A small $15/ share could be a retirement fund for someone looking for a home run.   


Please do your own due diligence, but I have done mine and have been in this over a year.   


IBM was also involved which will result in a second lawsuit later on when Walmart had IBM help tweak the ZEST technology, so it would not be one lawsuit, but a second that could help the price go up a second time.",ZEST (Ecoark holdings) comes in a few weeks,1.0,1615319054,obie1101

Small cap - ~2b in market cap right now. 

Founded by previous E*TRADE CEO and Uber CTO

Growing blazing fast (~3x month over month)

Customer acquisition cost is LOW ($35 to acquire an account and on average they make an average of $30 per month per account)

Coinbase IPO is imminent, and they are going public with a projected 1B market cap compared to Voyager’s 2B. 

They keep moving up the App Store charts and are ~#40 on the top finance apps right now.

23,m1eje7,"First off, 12 at 63 and still hodling 💎👐🏻. No matter when I sell (whatever that is), I’m coming out of this with a lot more money than I had before. Last year, my fiancée got diagnosed with a rare eye disorder called COATS disease. In short, her eye vessels never finished developing (she was pre mature), and now it’s starting to affect her vision. It’s a very rare disorder (I believe only 200,000 people in the states have it). She gets a mix of eye injections and laser surgery every other month, and the payment has been brutal. She just turned 26, so no more parent’s insurance. She only is able to work part time while she finishes her masters program, and then will finally have the time to get a full time job (and insurance). She’s been having to finesse any cash she can to make ends meet and keep her vision steady.

But because of you apes, I now have the funds to be able to pay for her next laser treatment in full. I seriously cannot thank you all enough, and I’m sure she would too.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rumor of an [Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/) even on March 23rd, some items that may be coming:
   1. [AirTags](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/) \- not that exciting, just their version of Tile
   2. [AirPods](https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/15/60-million-airpods-sold-in-2019/) \- Apple has sold 60 million of these in 2019....that's 71% of true wireless headphone revenue
   3. Potential for new Mac / iPad updates. The iMac Pro has been discontinued so it's possible they make an announcement around a Mac product here. 

Company Fundamentals:

* From the above you'll see they have a commanding share of the true wireless headphone market. Any additional updates to the AirPods would be a great revenue generator. As much as people roasted the over the ear AirPods max...they're sold out everywhere and people were paying 2x the price to get them off eBay. 
* Looking below there is a steady increase in revenue from the iPad, Mac...and significant growth from ""other"" which would be your AirPods, that new AirTag and other accessories.

For those of you who understand how the 10yr relates to equity markets and how inflation = bad news for Apple...It's trading at an attractive P/E right now compared to other companies. It has a lower P/E than Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Adobe etc. 

https://preview.redd.it/cfh8d1qw32m61.png?width=2846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a0c4692e6c980db9f6d851249503bb4e14cd4e

They had their best earnings report ever last quarter, and the stock dropped after, and continued to do so from $140 down to a low of $116 yesterday. 

*Processing img luqayw4542m61...*

Apple is below it's price it entered 2021 at, which to me flashes a huge buy sign as this is oversold. While tech might not have growth like it did in 2021, and just because $AAPL has mountains of cash, I don't think any pending inflation fears should sway anyone away from thinking this is as blue chip as you can get.

86,m1esm0,"After moving from RH, I was getting frustrated that TDA and other brokers wouldn't let me place set it and forget it limit orders for GME at really high prices.  I only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest.  I called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone, no dice. The explanation they gave me was that it is not their call, it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price.  The broker claimed that the MM's have finite bandwidth on their order books, so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price, then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price.  Since the MM's don't think that it's possible for the price to moon that quick so there's no chance of ever being filled they don't allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled.  Which, LOL, then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0DTE options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week?  I did test this to see if it was true both ways. I tried to place a limit buy for GME on TDA at $1 price, and it rejected that for being too far from market price.
