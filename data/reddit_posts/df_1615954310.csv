34,m6s4sq,"$CSTL DD smooth brains. 

I can‚Äôt sleep as I am preparing to go on nights, so I spent some time on FINRA‚Äôs website looking at short volumes because bears suck and I found $CSTL 

I have no position in $CSTL and I don‚Äôt plan to take one. 
$CSTL has a 1.6bn mktcp and little to no option interest and what interest there is all puts and those bears are going get fucked here. 

WTF is $SCTL
Castle Biosciences makes melanoma tests, and is using AI and genetic profiles to make predictive outcomes on melanoma cancer. 

In December CSTL got partial medicare approval for their most advanced Melanoma screening, on the LCD level. To you people who know nothing about biotechs, let me school you why this is huge. FDA approval is great, but if CMS (admin for Medicare and Medicaid) won‚Äôt pay for whatever widget the biotech is hawking than the company is going out of business. LCD approval means with a geographical area, the test is paid for. For CSTL that area represents 90% of the melanoma diagnoses in the US.

tl;dr CSTL is going to get PAID when hot girl summer starts and my wife and her boyfriend start fucking outside. 

Let‚Äôs talk pipeline, IE what have you done from me lately. CSTL is growing their testing portfolio from 2bn TAM to 5bn. They clearly are not planning on being a one-hit wonder looking for a buyout. 

Okay we know what the do and that they are going to get paid for it. Lets DD on their financials. 

This past year they retired all of their debt, ALL OF THEIR DEBT, and they quadruped their Cash on hand from 100mm to 400mm. No debt, tons of cash, test getting CMS payment approval, growth to the moon baby. 

Versus other biotech test companies, they have higher revenue growth and a higher profit margin. 
ROE, ROI, ROA all meet or exceed the industry. 

Let‚Äôs look at the negatives, their latest results showed a -.24 v estimate of -.12. No surprise there people were staying inside due to COVID and retiring all of their debt. With only 84% institutional ownership it shows skepticism for future growth, but the vaccine is here and people will be going outside. PT on the stock is 90.00 and it exceeded that back in march. Currently in 60‚Äôs there is a ton of room for growth. RSI is right at 50, so even more room to grow.","$CSTL DD, post-COVID people going outside and they will get cancer and CSTL will get paid",0.5,1615955244,colpuck

This is the very first and only stock that I‚Äôve ever purchased and although I don‚Äôt know shit about stocks (I understand the concept but that‚Äôs it), this is something I‚Äôll never forget. I‚Äôm happy for everyone who‚Äôs lives have changed for the better and it‚Äôs heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity. 

But I‚Äôm gonna be a negative Nancy ape for a bit. You guys saw it. You guys are seeing it. We‚Äôre all watching it live. How manipulative media outlets are. How quick they are at shooting their arrows. How our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they ‚Äúquestioned‚Äù that Bosnian whatever the fuck from Robindahood. They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. 

They tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attaching day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it‚Äôs because of the good intent in this sub gnat helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. 

I mean, I know the cliche of ‚Äúnever trust the news,etc‚Äù but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can‚Äôt see it by now you‚Äôre obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they‚Äôll just change up the rules to punish the ‚Äúlittle guys‚Äù. It really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor. 

You honestly couldn‚Äôt write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls. A fucking store that buys and sells used video games. A dude that seems like he‚Äôd make Keanu Reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit exposed them; but not because he wanted to fuck them over, but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol.

49,m6sao3,"Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future. 

One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.

Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.

""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release. 

And so they did, but then they had a problem.

The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know. 

And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.

Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""

And this was the game that they made up:

#Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours minimum to flip again.

This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in. 

This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time one wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias. So at most you would have to flip a coin 20 times in order to sell 100% of your shares, having sold 5% each time you sold. in the fastest you could possibly sell off would be 10 days before you would have zero stock left to sell.

This is part IV, and it seems the story is volatile. Part one got taken down due to a Clerical error on my part. I'm really just Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I just was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if that's not enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike took out part two and three.

54,m6sc8l,"Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.

Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.

He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""

He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.

They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.

HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.

He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.

TLDR

So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.

Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.

Hello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the ""case study"" below.

I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.

I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.

Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. 

Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...

1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company‚Äôs competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company‚Äôs new motto: ‚Äú**The Platform for Amazing Things**.‚Äù
2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""

Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.

Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it.
This was done at 11Am, March 16th.

TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI. 

GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday. 

My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19. 

What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK. 
You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone. Whoever the good hedge is, or the whale, who is fighting for us, will act at some point, and it will be obvious to anyone watching MACD and order books.

Imagine we're California (my home state) instead of Melvin, and instead of shorts, we're Covid. When Covid first hit in March, we panicked, locked down (covered our shorts) and thought we kicked it. We NEVER imagined that apes would fucking LIKE THIS STOCK, i.e. turns out Covid isn't just the flu, and after a few weeks of chilling, BOOM SECOND WAVE hits us so hard we're still scrambling.

As you ""may"" or ""may"" not know, May the 4th is Star Wars day (you know because it sounds like May the Force...)

Has anyone else read or heard that there's an underground movement to buy Electra Meccanica Vehicles ($SOLO, #solo) stock on Star Wars day, GameStop style?
