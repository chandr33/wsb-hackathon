1,m2hq9h,"Hi all,

I´m really happy to be bringing this to you as it is my very first D&amp;D. I´m not bringing you any technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some informal research and maybe you find it helpful. Also please bear with me as English is not my main language so I try my best.

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

**How I came up with this stock:**

I lost three family members to breast cancer and unfortunately, I lived through the course of the disease with them. Reading about the illness I came across Endoxifen something I will talk about later. But to make things short, Endoxifen helps estrogen receptors to help with breast cancer.

**What is Atossa Therapeutics doing and why it´s important:**

Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa’s current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19.

**(1)** **Product AT-301:** COVID-19 Nasal Spray. (Currently completed Phase 1)

**---&gt;** GREAT CATALYST IN THE NEAR FUTURE **&lt;---**

AT-301 is Atossa’s proprietary formula intended for nasal administration in patients immediately following a diagnosis of COVID-19 but who have not yet exhibited symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization. It is intended for at-home use to proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19 and to slow the infection rate so that a person’s immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.

**Important information:** On February the 25th of 2021, they provided great news about Phase 1.

“AT-301 was considered to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in this study at two different dose levels over 14 days.”

“The most common treatment-related adverse events observed with AT-301 treatment with either single or multiple doses were nasal discomfort and sneezing.”

“The results from this study are very encouraging and we look forward to quickly commencing the next study of AT-301,” commented **Steven Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Atossa’s President, and CEO**. “We recently received input from the FDA on this program and based in part on that input, we are now preparing to conduct an additional pre-clinical study, which we expect to start this quarter. Following that, **we expect to apply to the FDA to commence a Phase 2** study here in the United States.”

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atossa-therapeutics-announces-final-results-140000965.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atossa-therapeutics-announces-final-results-140000965.html)

**(2)** **Product AT-H201:** COVID-19 HOPE. (Planning Phase 1)

**---&gt;** GREAT CATALYST FOR THE NEAR FUTURE AND THOSE THAT DON´T WANT TO GET VACCINATED **&lt;---**

The goal of the COVID-19 HOPE program is to develop a therapy to improve lung function and reduce the amount of time that COVID-19 patients are on ventilators. The program uses a novel combination of two drugs that have been previously approved by the FDA for other diseases.

There are five known key steps the coronavirus must take to signal the cell to open and let the virus in. AT-H201 is being designed to function like a “chemical vaccine” by blocking all five of those steps, similar to what antibodies would be expected to do when a vaccine is administered.

**Atossa expects that its AT-H201 drug combination can be developed more quickly than a traditional vaccine.**

**(3)** **Product: ORAL ENDOXIFEN**

\- **Window of Opportunity**

\- **Refractory Endoxifen supplementation (TBD)**

\- **Mammographic Breast Density (Sweden)**

**Be notified: This is going to belong, specific, with several scientific terms but I will do my best to simplify everything. I am not a doctor, nor do I study anything related to medicine, I apologize if I make any mistake in what I write.**

**IF YOU DON´T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE EXPLANATION,** **JUST KNOW THAT ENDOXIFEN SOLVES** **THE MAIN ISSUE WITH TODAY´S MOST-PRESCRIBED DRUG TO BATTLE AGAINST BREAST CANCER.**

Endoxifen is the most active metabolite (ingredient) of the FDA-approved drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has been used since its approval in 1977 for breast cancer survivors to prevent recurrence as well as the development of new cancer. Tamoxifen is a “pro-drug,” in that it must be metabolized by the liver into active metabolites in order to have activity in the body.

To this date **Tamoxifen** is the oldest and most-prescribed selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) approved by the FDA to treat:

\- women and men diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer after surgery (or possibly chemotherapy and radiation) to reduce the risk of cancer coming back (recurring).

\- women and men diagnosed with advanced-stage or metastatic hormone-receptor-positive disease.

\- reduce breast cancer risk in women who haven't been diagnosed but are at higher-than-average risk for the disease.

The body uses an enzyme called **CYP2D6 to convert tamoxifen into its active form**. Two things can interfere with the body’s ability to make this happen: a flaw in the CYP2D6 enzyme (About 10% of people have a CYP2D6 enzyme that doesn’t function as well as it should) and certain medications that block the effectiveness of this enzyme (such as antidepressants, Cardioquin, Benadryl and Tagamet)

*If you like to know more, please go to this link:* [*https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen*](https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen)

So why I´m explaining this to you all? Because the active agent on tamoxifen is **endoxifen** and for the reasons mentioned above and others, women's bodies might be unable to effectively metabolize tamoxifen and, consequently, it does not produce endoxifen.

Why is **Endoxifen** so important? When Tamoxifen gets metabolized by the **CYP2D6** enzyme endoxifen and afimoxifene are created. If the body has a flaw in that enzyme, the current treatment wouldn´t work so with Endoxifen as a prodrug we are solving the biggest issue with the current most used prescribed SERM.

In the Journal of Clinical Oncology – Volume 35, Issue 30, there is a detailed explanation on the first-in-human phase I study of direct endoxifen application to metastatic breast cancer patients. The conclusion of this study showed that **endoxifen provides substantial drug exposure unaffected by CYP2D6 metabolism, acceptable toxicity, and promising antitumor activity.**

You can read the complete issue here: [https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.3246](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.3246)

**About Oral Endoxifen:**

Atossa Therapeutics is developing an oral form of **endoxifen** and recently reported positive interim results from the Phase 2 study to treat breast cancer in the window of opportunity between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery. A statistically significant reduction of about 74% in tumor cell proliferation was achieved over the 22 days of dosing. Proliferation was measured by Ki-67, a recognized standard measurement of breast cancer cell proliferation.

On the 3rd of February, the company shared great news announcing a Two-Year update of the FDA-Approved expanded access treatment with endoxifen. Just to summarize this, to this date, after 26 months the patient treated with Atossa´s Oral Endoxifen showed no recurrence of breast cancer; the treatment has been well-tolerated, including an absence of typical vasomotor symptoms commonly associated with tamoxifen (night sweats and hot flashes for example).

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169192/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Two-Year-Update-of-FDA-Approved-Expanded-Access-Treatment-with-Endoxifen.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169192/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Two-Year-Update-of-FDA-Approved-Expanded-Access-Treatment-with-Endoxifen.html)

**My opinion on this:**

This product shows great results, great life expectancy, reduction of secondary symptoms, reduction of possible problems or inconveniences when obtaining results. Considering this and that the company has more than 26 months of testing this I don´t see why this won´t get approved by the FDA. About 20% of the 300,000 US women currently taking tamoxifen (largely to prevent recurrence of breast cancer) do not achieve sufficient concentrations of endoxifen and may have an increased risk of cancer recurrence. In 2019 FDA allowed the use of oral endoxifen as a post-mastectomy treatment in a single pre-menopausal, ER+ breast cancer patient who had previously already completed a three-week course of endoxifen prior to surgery under an FDA EAP.

**TLDR/ Conclusion:**

This is a great company, undervalued in my opinion, with huge upcoming catalysts that could change the world, and don´t take that as an exaggeration, I hope you never have to see a family member suffer from this disease, but if so, a product like this company's may be the solution to your prayers. Just think about it, they are fighting against the biggest issue the biggest “cure” breast cancer has.

Hello fellow apes! As some of you know, Canoo is an EV company that is working on a number of vehicles slated to launch in the next few years. They are currently partnered with Hyundai, and were actually in talks with Apple last year [talks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev) before Apple decided not to go through with the Apple car. Though it didn't work out, they are still at it and working towards a solid launch in a few years. Sure that's nice and all, but why is this even important??

Well listen up apes, I don't really know what this means because I'm retarded, but GOEV has a put/call ratio of 0.06. That means that there is a fuck ton of open interest for calls, and a sweet looking ramp is in the works. How soon do you ask? Well, these options are slated to expire on 3/19 and 4/16, so if my dumb brain can do math, that means soon.

But why? Well tomorrow they'll announce a shiny new truck and the week after will have a.conference. Bunch of coverage with this one lads. [electric truck leak](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)

# The Teslabro Fears the CanooTruck

I never imagined that I would spend so much time shilling for something that looks like it was designed in a Sanfransiscan Bath House but yesterday's leak of Canoo Truck really pushed me into the zone of CanooBro fanboy.  This Lesbian Mystery Machine is so financially compelling that I am straight ""Jacked to the Tits"" as /u/effinwookie puts it in GOEV calls.

**My current positions.**

1. 20 3/19 17.5$c - Straight Gambling
2. 46 4/16 30$c - Original Sane Position Position
3. 40 4/16 30$c - Retarded Yolo Gambling  Inspired by CavemanGigaChad /u/knyggaplease

I might be Blue collar fancy on the dab but I'm not as ""Jacked"" to the **Moontits** as the rest of the fucking market. There are a total of **98,125** open options interest for March 19th Calls.... 9.8 Million Shares all of them out of the money.  Think about that...

I didn't even look at the puts... ^((Ok TBH after writing that  I just looked at the puts because I don't want to be wrong) )

Lets talk about yesterday's trading and what Ortex tells us about short interest. Yesterday we saw a gap opening which settled down into slow bullish trajectory that dipped into close. As I write this at 1900 3/10 I am going to predict that short interest grew as today trading  characterized by price capping style trading where there always seemed to be an new few hundred shares that appear out of no where.  This is encouraging and discouraging at the same time.

**Future Self finds** \- Wait and SEE!

I am highly encouraged that some shorts have covered yet others (or the same one) have/has opened new positions at a lower share price. Average age of shorting has increased over the past few days but this could just be that the new short positions ""weigh"" less than the older ones.  This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.

Visit - [GoevWhale Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoevWhale) found this Dark pool Order by [Dark Pool Melstone](https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1369353690566524934?s=20)

I consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)**  Someone took up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.  2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches.  (Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price) This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue

What is encouraging is that the tactics over the last few days have been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize the price.  We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  The last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts (and of course normal profit taking or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing). 

**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go full bore...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..

**Listen, What I am saying is that Someone or some people with 9 milly in Short Interest spent the last few months beating your stock like a rented mule and then went and spent that margin somewhere else thinking $GOEV was SPAC trash.  They then woke up this week in a real bad situation and are now fighting like a cat over a fucking toilet to save themselves but you showed up with leather gloves on and a Surprise fucking truck and let the Gimp out of the cage...

This ""Truck"" was obviously designed by someone who has never seen a truck before because they were too busy playing fortnight. This is ok because there's genius here.

**The highlights for me are**

1. You can fit a sheet of plywood in the back.
2. It has an extended cab
3. You can power tools off of it.
4. It is meant to bring Flyoverstate people into the EV world.
5. The subscription allows small businesses to scale fleet size.  This is unknown to people that live in LA and think people sanely roof in the winter in the midwest or east coast.

(Cybertruck will release with the same level of reception as CyberPunk... Sick Burn Bro.)

**The money story,** and whats great about /u/planereflections drop is that [Reuters wrote an article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup/ev-startup-canoo-plans-to-roll-out-american-built-pod-like-electric-pickup-in-2023-idUSKBN2B3010?il=0) the truck leak.  (**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...

Last transaction was 889 Shares at 13.40.  12k on that price.   This news isn't priced in....

**Look, What I am trying to say is that these shorts are 9 million Shares in at around a sp of 17 or 18... This shit starts getting more squeezy as it nears those numbers aided by the gamma ramp somewhere around 24$ SP margins start getting called. Also Earnings hasn't even dropped yet...**

&amp;#x200B;

GME steadily has been producing some great gains this week, opening Monday bright and early at 154.89 and finally opening today at 269, looking poised to make our moonshot. Unfortunately, after peaking above 330, after a series of trading halts, plummeted down to 198, with restabilization by EOD.

To the unexperienced eye and paper hands, this looks like a time to sell.

# However...

To the experienced trader, this is a textbook Salmon chart. Lemme explain it clearly to the retarded paper hands here.

&amp;#x200B;

[The graph to a newbie](https://preview.redd.it/a9906egsmbm61.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6488bd00fd49bf5615874b05f2a0517172fd2926)

The Sockeye Salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway. It begins as a massive dip that goes below red (to match the color of breeding Sockeye), then some wacky shit for the ventral fin, and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish, in the green for approaching the head.

Ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth, despite hedge funds preventing direct, uninhibited access.

25,m2hvb4,"Been thinking about fighting 🔥 with 🔥 so here
is my utterly retarded idea..........

If every person holding 10+ shares shorted one share then all shares available to short would be consumed.  

I know what you are thinking.....wouldn’t we just
End up fucked like the Hedge Fund shitbags?  Absolutely fucking not......This is a retarded idea not a complete fuck yourself in the ass idea. The only sacrifice you Would be making is the profits of one measly share you are holding.  Small sacrifice for where we are headed 🌝 

So your saying I short one share.....how does it work after that.....great question fellow 🦧 when this rockets north of $10,000 or whatever number being used those same People would cover that one share at the same time they sell 1 share they currently hold. This makes the transaction a zero sum game. The liquidity of their other shares should in theory prevent them from being called early which would return that share to the available short pool. So you own share A that you bought at $254. You short share B at $255. Stock rises to $500k or whatever number. You sell and cover simultaneously bringing you back to a $1 difference. Meanwhile you sell your other 9+ shares at $500k making you the proud owner
of a fleet of lambos you will be getting blowjobs in for years to cum (see what I did there). 

How do I know I can trust my fellow 🦧 to do the same......it doesn’t really matter.  As long as you are holding one share and have one share
Shorted at a price higher than the share you own then you are your own safeguard. 

I’m not saying this is an airtight idea and for the love of god it needs some smarter people to really iron it out but this Is my JFK moment of saying we are going to the fucking moon so let’s figure It the fuck out.

I am more confident in the long term story than ever before and finally........ the company has come out and given us something to really listen to and to understand the 5 year narrative for purple's growth plan. There are no plays, just optimistic thoughts. 

I believe the recent price correction into the mid to high 30's is still in play in the short term and the 50 dollar price target is still in tact for end of year. This is just a guesstimate, I've been wrong more than I am right, but the upwards trajectory continues.

 A lot of you have been through the ups and down of PRPL with me. I wanted to give you my last DD before I focus on other investments. All of this DD is coming from two investor conferences that occurred in the last 48 hours. I am doing my best to summarize the key points.

# There is no stopping Purple's Domestic Plans 

***PURPE IS OPENING A STORE every \~12 DAYS for the rest of the year.***

* PRPL is anticipating becoming the #2 Player in the industry and is targeting \~1.5B\~2B in revenue- this Move is expected to take 3-5 years.
* PRPL is looking at tons of Merger and Acquisitions and this could potentially be a strategy but this is not their focus.
* PRPL anticipates 30-36% Growth for this year (2021) to 840-880M
   * PRPL Capacity at the end of 2021 will exceed 1B on a capacity standpoint
* PRPL is nearly doubling their brick and mortar presence in 2021 alone
   * 1500 stores
* PRPL anticipates 20-30% for the 2022+ years----- 3 to 5 years worth of continued growth domestically.
* PRPL anticipates Foreign Expansion won't be their focus until late 2022/2023
* PRPL is in 1800 stores and commands on 3% market share but they believe they will continue to take market share even in a downturn.
   * Tempur-Pedic is in about \~8000 stores.
* PRPL expects that they will have \~1.3B to \~1.5B before expanding internationally
* PRPL has tons of opportunity for higher price points in bedding
* PRPL believes 50% of the market opportunity is outside of the USA.
   * PRPL is so confident that they aren't focusing on overseas expansion until 2022 with the real effort anticipated to be in 2023
* Expansion is looking to be omni-channel
   * There is headroom for tons of Mattress firms
   * ""All Premium"" retailers have reached out to purple
* There is enough door expansion that they wouldn't be able to support them
   * PRPL is pacing expansion to ensure they can service their customers

ESTIMATING EBITDA for next 3 to 5 years- I am using 12.5% as midpoint Purple indicated it could be as high as 15% in 3-5 years.

# THE REASON FOR THE DROP AFTER EARNINGS

* Purple indicated the miss was not due to competition it was due to soft guidance for Q1 as a momentum quarter
* Soft guidance for Q1 is due to the quarter being focused on getting ready for Q2 onward
* Q3 will witness most of the growth that bleeds into Q4
* There are supply constraints that have pushed some of the growth out- they are working through this.
   * The only constraint affecting purple is coils.
   * They are hand to mouth on coils and will need more coils
   * Purple is not worried about competition at this point as they are no where near close to saturation.

# Where could the Stock Price GO

I have provided 2 P/E ratios and I have used the 25% growth scenario to calculate EBITDA. Based on these numbers, we could see a price from 30-96. If they exceed this then it wouldn't be unrealistic to see 45-120 as the range in the next 5 years. 2021 is a little over estimated as compared to their guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

[My rough estimates assuming EBITDA multiples of 20 and 25 and EBITDA Margin of 12.5&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/0ee72023rbm61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce469b42deaefe1744a9d51be7df53e2d8abaf7a)

# Comparing to Tempur Sealy using a higher EV/Sales ratio

Tempur sealy has about 1.5B in debt ,so their Enterprise value is much higher than purple. Using EV/Sales as an indicator for PRPL, we could assume that 3x Ev/Sales due to PRPLS superior growth and it would put the stock price @ 37.00 based on 2021 revenue estimates, 46.00 based on 2022 estimates, 57.00 based on 2023 estimates, 72 based on 2024 estimates and 90 based on 2025 estimates.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chart below is TPX (Tempur Sealy's current Metrics). Purple is growing much quicker and will likely command significantly better multiples.

&amp;#x200B;

# The analyst we need to follow- This guy is a savant and he covers tons of big names and is the 3rd most accurate analyst out of more than 7,000.

* Carvana is a stock that Brian has been coving since it was in the 30's...... The stock is nearly 260 dollars.

I´m really happy to be bringing this to you as it is my very first D&amp;D. I´m not bringing you any technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some informal research and maybe you find it helpful. Also please bear with me as English is not my main language so I try my best.

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

**How I came up with this stock:**

I lost three family members to breast cancer and unfortunately, I lived through the course of the disease with them. Reading about the illness I came across Endoxifen something I will talk about later. But to make things short, Endoxifen helps estrogen receptors to help with breast cancer.

**What is Atossa Therapeutics doing and why it´s important:**

Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa’s current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19.

**(1)** **Product AT-301:** COVID-19 Nasal Spray. (Currently completed Phase 1)

**---&gt;** GREAT CATALYST IN THE NEAR FUTURE **&lt;---**

AT-301 is Atossa’s proprietary formula intended for nasal administration in patients immediately following a diagnosis of COVID-19 but who have not yet exhibited symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization. It is intended for at-home use to proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19 and to slow the infection rate so that a person’s immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.

**Important information:** On February the 25th of 2021, they provided great news about Phase 1.

“AT-301 was considered to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in this study at two different dose levels over 14 days.”

“The most common treatment-related adverse events observed with AT-301 treatment with either single or multiple doses were nasal discomfort and sneezing.”

“The results from this study are very encouraging and we look forward to quickly commencing the next study of AT-301,” commented **Steven Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Atossa’s President, and CEO**. “We recently received input from the FDA on this program and based in part on that input, we are now preparing to conduct an additional pre-clinical study, which we expect to start this quarter. Following that, **we expect to apply to the FDA to commence a Phase 2** study here in the United States.”

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atossa-therapeutics-announces-final-results-140000965.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atossa-therapeutics-announces-final-results-140000965.html)

**(2)** **Product AT-H201:** COVID-19 HOPE. (Planning Phase 1)

**---&gt;** GREAT CATALYST FOR THE NEAR FUTURE AND THOSE THAT DON´T WANT TO GET VACCINATED **&lt;---**

The goal of the COVID-19 HOPE program is to develop a therapy to improve lung function and reduce the amount of time that COVID-19 patients are on ventilators. The program uses a novel combination of two drugs that have been previously approved by the FDA for other diseases.

There are five known key steps the coronavirus must take to signal the cell to open and let the virus in. AT-H201 is being designed to function like a “chemical vaccine” by blocking all five of those steps, similar to what antibodies would be expected to do when a vaccine is administered.

**Atossa expects that its AT-H201 drug combination can be developed more quickly than a traditional vaccine.**

**(3)** **Product: ORAL ENDOXIFEN**

\- **Window of Opportunity**

\- **Refractory Endoxifen supplementation (TBD)**

\- **Mammographic Breast Density (Sweden)**

**Be notified: This is going to belong, specific, with several scientific terms but I will do my best to simplify everything. I am not a doctor, nor do I study anything related to medicine, I apologize if I make any mistake in what I write.**

**IF YOU DON´T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE EXPLANATION,** **JUST KNOW THAT ENDOXIFEN SOLVES** **THE MAIN ISSUE WITH TODAY´S MOST-PRESCRIBED DRUG TO BATTLE AGAINST BREAST CANCER.**

Endoxifen is the most active metabolite (ingredient) of the FDA-approved drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has been used since its approval in 1977 for breast cancer survivors to prevent recurrence as well as the development of new cancer. Tamoxifen is a “pro-drug,” in that it must be metabolized by the liver into active metabolites in order to have activity in the body.

To this date **Tamoxifen** is the oldest and most-prescribed selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) approved by the FDA to treat:

\- women and men diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer after surgery (or possibly chemotherapy and radiation) to reduce the risk of cancer coming back (recurring).

\- women and men diagnosed with advanced-stage or metastatic hormone-receptor-positive disease.

\- reduce breast cancer risk in women who haven't been diagnosed but are at higher-than-average risk for the disease.

The body uses an enzyme called **CYP2D6 to convert tamoxifen into its active form**. Two things can interfere with the body’s ability to make this happen: a flaw in the CYP2D6 enzyme (About 10% of people have a CYP2D6 enzyme that doesn’t function as well as it should) and certain medications that block the effectiveness of this enzyme (such as antidepressants, Cardioquin, Benadryl and Tagamet)

*If you like to know more, please go to this link:* [*https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen*](https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen)

So why I´m explaining this to you all? Because the active agent on tamoxifen is **endoxifen** and for the reasons mentioned above and others, women's bodies might be unable to effectively metabolize tamoxifen and, consequently, it does not produce endoxifen.

Why is **Endoxifen** so important? When Tamoxifen gets metabolized by the **CYP2D6** enzyme endoxifen and afimoxifene are created. If the body has a flaw in that enzyme, the current treatment wouldn´t work so with Endoxifen as a prodrug we are solving the biggest issue with the current most used prescribed SERM.

In the Journal of Clinical Oncology – Volume 35, Issue 30, there is a detailed explanation on the first-in-human phase I study of direct endoxifen application to metastatic breast cancer patients. The conclusion of this study showed that **endoxifen provides substantial drug exposure unaffected by CYP2D6 metabolism, acceptable toxicity, and promising antitumor activity.**

You can read the complete issue here: [https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.3246](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.3246)

**About Oral Endoxifen:**

Atossa Therapeutics is developing an oral form of **endoxifen** and recently reported positive interim results from the Phase 2 study to treat breast cancer in the window of opportunity between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery. A statistically significant reduction of about 74% in tumor cell proliferation was achieved over the 22 days of dosing. Proliferation was measured by Ki-67, a recognized standard measurement of breast cancer cell proliferation.

On the 3rd of February, the company shared great news announcing a Two-Year update of the FDA-Approved expanded access treatment with endoxifen. Just to summarize this, to this date, after 26 months the patient treated with Atossa´s Oral Endoxifen showed no recurrence of breast cancer; the treatment has been well-tolerated, including an absence of typical vasomotor symptoms commonly associated with tamoxifen (night sweats and hot flashes for example).

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169192/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Two-Year-Update-of-FDA-Approved-Expanded-Access-Treatment-with-Endoxifen.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169192/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Two-Year-Update-of-FDA-Approved-Expanded-Access-Treatment-with-Endoxifen.html)

**My opinion on this:**

This product shows great results, great life expectancy, reduction of secondary symptoms, reduction of possible problems or inconveniences when obtaining results. Considering this and that the company has more than 26 months of testing this I don´t see why this won´t get approved by the FDA. About 20% of the 300,000 US women currently taking tamoxifen (largely to prevent recurrence of breast cancer) do not achieve sufficient concentrations of endoxifen and may have an increased risk of cancer recurrence. In 2019 FDA allowed the use of oral endoxifen as a post-mastectomy treatment in a single pre-menopausal, ER+ breast cancer patient who had previously already completed a three-week course of endoxifen prior to surgery under an FDA EAP.

The founder, Chairman &amp; CEO of Atossa Therapeutics is **Steven Quay**, physician-scientist, inventor, author, and serial biotechnology entrepreneur who has founded six companies completed two successful IPOs, and rebranded the seventh company over the course of a career that spans over 25 years. Recognized for inventing six drugs that are FDA or EMEA approved, one medical device that is FDA-cleared and CE marked, and securing 87 U.S. Patents and over 130 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications.

**TLDR/ Conclusion:**

This is a great company, undervalued in my opinion, with huge upcoming catalysts that could change the world, and don´t take that as an exaggeration, I hope you never have to see a family member suffer from this disease, but if so, a product like this company's may be the solution to your prayers. Just think about it, they are fighting against the biggest issue the biggest “cure” breast cancer has.

59,m2i0gr,"Ok you beautiful fuckers, I am just an ape and this is not Financial Advice. Seriously, don't take advice from me, I'm 'tarded just like the rest of you.

Let's start with what I think happened today. Unlike most apes on here think, it wasn't massive shorts that caused that dip. No, in my opinion, it was a massive stock selloff from the hedge funds. If you're wondering how, it's because they've been buying alongside us for the last little while. I was wondering why we were shooting up day by day, facing little to no resistance. And, I also found it strange how GME was no longer trading inverse to the market. I'm sure some of you were noticing that too. How could things be going so smoothly, with GME and just about every other stock? Because this was all planned. They've been helping us pump up the price.

What's the good news? The good news is, they can only do that so many times. In my estimation, they will only be able to do that once more (and even then, it's questionable if they have the resources). Also, since IB is reporting a low amount of shorts remaining, it won't be possible to push the price down like this in any other fashion. And according to some other apes on here, we're on the SSR list tomorrow... So everyone remember to buy $CUM, $BBC, $BBW, and any other stocks of that like.

But seriously, why would they buy alongside us? Well, it's been theorized on here by several different users. I'd credit them, but I don't know their usernames. I have seen predictions that an attack like this may be made as far back as during the first round of GME. As for the 'Why', well the why is simple. They wanted to shake paperhands. They thought they could crash this thing like they did at the end of Round 1, when things started to fall from $300ish. But it didn't work. And this tells us everything we need to know.

The important things to note are 1)We have a safe buying wall around the $250 to $260 level (Thank God, love you fellow apes!) 2)According to IBorrowDesk (At time of writing), there are only 150,000 shares available for shorting. 3)There are new shorts around the $260 level today, as well as some other up around $340. The lower shorts should help push us up. 4)This whole crash strategy was super risky for them to undertake. Not only could they have lost a lot of money, but the whole thing could backfire and ""renew"" belief in GME.

To address point 4. Very simply, you wouldn't buy 1.5 Million shares of GME and attempt to crash it if you were covered, would you? The answer is no. And, you wouldn't risk losing money on such a massive gamble, unless it could save you money elsewhere, correct? I think that's also correct. And perhaps MOST IMPORTANTLY. If they were worried about increasing the price, but felt they had to buy shares to attempt this strategy (which would in turn, help increase the price and also increase faith in GME), then they absolutely would not do that. The strategy is too risky. Unless.... They had no other choice.

Ladies and Gentleman, I think that's the exact scenario. This was their last major tool to throw everyone off. It didn't work. Not even close. Sure, they may use short ladders going forward. And hell, if they get too desperate, they may try this strategy at a higher value. But they crashed it, paid writers to write hit pieces, and sent the bots and shills out in full force to make us feel like we ""Missed the squeeze"". Fuck you, we didn't miss shit.

So, what now? We buy, and we hold. And remember, SSR list tomorrow. I believe the way we start the day will set the tone of the whole thing. And we need belief in our fellow apes. So hold on like your wife's boyfriend holds onto her ass, and buy as much as you can. Let's bust the lower shorts, and go back for the retards above $400. The moon is next.

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield &amp; 10 Year Yield](https://preview.redd.it/l2f5buijubm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36007c98a80568d8e10210ceb35112f83520f7f)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.** 

[10-Year Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/pjospxbpubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23e515781e1fde96e73ea04d8292ed985710d0ee)

Why did the 10-year yield **🚀 🌝**?

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

Why does the economy reopening = inflation?

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - MV = PQ, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/85liuqosubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2ae9811e158cdf5cfb18124ac36a1964b2ffbf)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/00rnrx4uubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15729986ceccc14e0022cc7090b5e5077819d5c)

By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

*Processing img ft66nwfwubm61...*

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

What did JPowell say?

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/cspz6f1evbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cbfbe0bb4e6133d03e2ef6f506d64adb61432b)

[Fed Funds Rate](https://preview.redd.it/aujgi1jevbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78424f8f64d996a8557d22da8ea84c5cc9cb1299)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for this chapter is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

***TLDR; Stonks only go  📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

97,m2i6f6,"Alright, you all get your crayons out of your mouths for a second and use them.  I am a long-term lurker of WSB and I love this community. I made an account recently so I could participate in the fun. I am in medical school and really haven't had the time to set down and write something up for a post until one of my assignments got canceled tonight.  If the CubanMister can take time out of his schedule for you apes, I damn sure can too. I am just a baby monkey compared to the Cuban.

I study technical analysis probably more than I study medicine, which makes me a mediocre medical student at best. However, technical analysis is my passion. I just need those doctor tendies so I can have enough capital someday.  If this moon, I can just quit medical school, and I can pay off my almost $200k in debit. So here we go....

This wouldn't be a complete post without mentioning my wife's boyfriend.  He loves when I study technical analysis because I put my noise-canceling headphones on and I can't hear a thing. Take this shit out of the galaxy apes. This is in no way financial advice. Trade at your own risk. Hope you all like my first post.

DTCC, stimulus, loyal base, summer movies hits, the entire country opening, immunizations... We all know 4th qtr earnings are going to suck because of Coivd. So what.. it’s over. And that is past news. Let me remind you all. AMC is up about 30 percent this week. Why ? Well freaking we all know the Ape army and the general public is going to poor into amc and our rival/Gme. DTC is coming 8-60 days all depends if the sec submits a rebuttal. That is a GAME CHANGER FOR AMC. The hedge fund golden spoon boys who sucked daddy’s credit card and went to Harvard and MIT are fukeddd. Bank ain’t gonna lend you that much and they are gonna have the ability to call for Funds at anytime. This will change the game and at a minimum push up the stock. We also have the usuals. America opening, Coivd vaccinations, movie lovers wanting to go back with their families. AMC has a better foundation then gme. 

Important!!! Hey guys and gals think about it.. AMC is a 110 year old company. Survived world war 1 and 2 and Spanish flu. It’s a solid company about to pop during the summer (we all know this) b I t c o I n is an imaginary digital currency. If you think about it to much you’ll get a headache and it actually doesn’t even exist in the real world: yet how much is it worth ?? Exactly..,, for all the AMC bitch haters. AMC was not worth more then 20 dollars in 2019 because it wasn’t a hot stock, it wasn’t tech, it wasn’t Amazon , it wasn’t trending. Guess the fuck what ? It’s hot now amd will sizzle Into the fall. Entertainment is the tech of 2021. AMC profits in the upcoming qtrs will crush expectations. 

Go ... go to the movies . Nothing good playing ? Our money is playing. Watch a cartoon dragon, watch a silly love story, watch a car get blown up. Get out to the AMC movies!!! Common sense. AMC army strong. Patience and holding and micro purchasing will get us anything we want. Hold and push.","AMC , COMMON SENSE 3. A few reasons AMC may increase in stock value. As in will fo to the moon. Not financial advice just discussion and common sense. Yes I did analyze the heck out of DTCC.",1.0,1615438573,oppositeofoutside
