73,m177hl,"Hey all you wonderful Apes.

I've never been more happy to be a part of something than this community. This has been an insane ride and the fun part is knowing that it is only the beginning.

Before we all board the GME rocket and blast into the atmosphere I just wanted to share a little positivity with you and explain a few things that might help turn the last few 🧻🙌 into 💎🙌

Right now you are probably starting to see green, or if not you're getting excited because you can see that your time in the red is almost over. After all no 🦍 is being left behind.

You're probably worrying about missing the peak and not selling out at the right time. IE either missing it or cashing out too early.

There's lots of whales invested and you probably think that they'll pull out and leave you holding the bags.... Again.

I don't think this will happen, and here's why. These whales are super smart, have you ever seen a whales brain? They're roughly the size of a V8 engine. The smart play is to 💎🙌 and buy options to sell at ever increasing prices as the price goes up. They can profit from selling the options on or buy even more shares after the peak and get insane returns.

This means they won't sell you out, they'll find a crazy high price option and exit before the contract expires long after the stock takes off into another Galaxy.

Probably so they can hoover up from those who paper handed even more shares to sell from their options.

The only way you'll miss out is by paper handing.

So don't believe the misinformation, the shorts haven't covered, I'm too retarded to have an exit strategy, don't invest what you can't afford to loose, this isn't financial advice.

Stay positive, this squeeze might not happen this week, or this month but we can remain retarded longer than they can remain solvent.",GME pre flight prep talk,1.0,1615299180,OriginalGoatan

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

90,m1796f,"In the last GME squeeze we saw consistent price patterns with short ladder attacks everyday. The stock would get pumped up in pre-market and come crashing down at open only to recover. 

This time? None of that. I don't think we have seen one short ladder attack taking the stock down 10-15% at open within a hour. 

Don't you love it? The United States of Corporations regulating body the Securities Exchange Committee of Rich Shills won't investigate this. Its like when you were growing up and your mom asked you to clean your room and you just went in your room and pissed around and everytime your mom asked if you cleaned your room you would say yes with a big smile while playing while in actuality you were playing with your legos.

I'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.

1-  It will potentially be included into the **Russell 1000 and 3000** on 03/22/2021.

2-  Short Volume Ratio is 31% (fintel). In addition, only 4,000 shares are available for shorting(for today, fintel). 0 were available yesterday. To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, that's considered extremely high. We have 31% so a short squeeze is inevitable?

3- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of gamma squeezing. The open interest of calls is insanely high above 10$. Once it hits and stays above $10, the gamma squeeze could take it to a whole new solar system.

4- stock is massively undervalued, Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $19.76 - Currently going for $8.06$.

5- The CEO might appear on Mad Money this week or the next which would get it the exposure it needs for a short squeeze.

6-   Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall. $UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to $RKT(competitor), which is expected to see a large drop. 

7- Today is the last day of buying the stock to be included in the dividend payout.
