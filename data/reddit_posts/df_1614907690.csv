3,ly0qx3,"Since you are all fucking retards, you might not realize the IRS requires you to pay taxes as you make money.  They're constantly quoting Dirty saying ""If you wana look good and not be bummy, girl you better give me that money"".

So in order not to get bitch slapped with fees and penalties, you need to pay estimated taxes quarterly.

This is done by filling form 1040ES [Found here](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es)

First quarter 2021 is due April 15th [due dates and FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax)

You most likely will need to do this if you will owe 1k or more.  If you have regular income and have income taxes deducted through payroll, you should only need to pay estimated taxes on your capital gains 

I'm not a CPA or financial advisor, so don't quote me boy, cause I ain't saying shit.

You should consult a tax advisor or CPA if you have questions.

Edit: As u/plumpstegadon reminded me, you can also adjust your W2 withholding to pay your taxes too.

Edit2:  [IRS Withholding Estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator)

Edit3: As per u/squatomatic which I believe is correct:

 ""I've been filing my taxes by hand for a few years now, my understanding is that your tax payments made through the year need to be either at least as much as your tax liability from the previous year, or within 10% of your actual liability. So if your withholdings are at least as much as last year you can probably just cut them a check when you pay your next taxes. Unless that changes somehow with capital gains or large amounts? I'm not an accountant, that's just what I've read in the 1040 instructions.""

 Today we just briefly broke the 144.80 on the daily candles, and there's a good chance it now explodes into the next previous larger candle between the orange lines of 170.79 and 186.58. This, because it's charted on the daily, could get up there over the next several candles for days, or just shoot straight up there soon depending on volume.","GME chart inside candle explosion, possible 170-186 fast",0.92,1614908003,Guilty-Marzipan

22,ly0tm3,"Today was an important day. Wrap your mind around what is going on here and you will make massive tendies.

TLDR: Short TLT, Short High-Flying Growth Stonks, Long Blue Chip Low-Growth Boomer Stonks

Treasuries have been on a steep decline (yields increasing) since last summer. Why? Massive printing by JPOW devaluing the dollar, along with resilient spending and recovery in sight. This means INFLATION. Folks have been crying wolf about inflation for years. Goldbugs and fake-internet-money enthusiasts have been decrying Fed intervention for ages. And they have been mostly wrong. But the bond market has finally started to price in an inflation reality with yields climbing at a higher rate in recent weeks than they have in many years.

Fast-forward to today: JPOW says inflation is set to increase (finally acknowledging reality) but will continue printing and has no intention of raising interest rates. Remember, the Fed's new stance is to let inflation run hotter than 2%, treating this number as an average not a ceiling. This means yields have much higher to go. Look at how TLT absolutely fell off a cliff after his comments this afternoon, and is making new lows as treasuries continue to dive after hours.

So why did stonks have a fit today? Because inflation = higher rates = higher cost to borrow money = LOWER GROWTH = LOWER GROWTH MULTIPLES ON STONKS

Expect high-flying, high-growth, high-multiple stonks to continue to get absolutely punished as there is a rotation away from leverage and into stable, low-growth blue chip names. Today was an important day, and IMHO only the beginning. Good luck and may the tendies be with you.","DD: Inflation, Treasuries, Stonks and You",0.83,1614908023,orockers

I've made a couple of lengthy posts about NOK in the past, and I think this will be my last one for a while as what will happen in the next few months will mean that no more DD will need to be posted on NOK.

Position: 2500 shares and 200 calls (mostly leaps, but a good chunk of 3/19s)

**The week of 3/19 is going to be absolutely bananas!!!**

If you haven't read this post from u/bosshax, then you seriously need to stop reading this one, and go read his. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw383o/mememageddon\_march\_19th\_quadruple\_witching\_amc\_bb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw383o/mememageddon_march_19th_quadruple_witching_amc_bb/)

I'll sum it up. The OI on calls on basically any stock related to WSB is absolutely nuts for that week. I understand it's quadruple witching, so they were already going to be elevated anyway, but I'm seeing numbers on some strikes that are just absolutely bananas.

On NOK, the OI is 10-20x higher or more on pretty much any strike close to the money right now.

**NOK has an event on 3/18 that could change the entire paradigm on the stock!**

Long story short, they have their annual capital markets day event on 3/18. There's a possibility they could announce a multitude of things. Here are the relevant items I'm interested in:

*Slight caveat...some estimates say NOK has close to $10B cash on hand right now. I don't think that is accurate. From what I recall it's closer to \~$3B. Either way, they have the cash to make the below things possible.*

\- Dividends - this is the absolute biggie. Now, I know, dividends are boring as hell, and only for boomers. Yeah, that's cool and all, but if NOK announces dividends, they will draw all the old $$$$ out that thinks they still make $$$ from phones (holla for the 3310!!!!). Additionally there are billions in AUM in ETFs that will add NOK to their allocation, and some of them may add big time if it's EU focused, and weighted by market cap.

\- Buybacks - this is simple. NOK's float is dumb. Nearly 6B out there. They have to buy back shares if we are ever gonna see this move.

\- More investment into R&amp;D to increase profitability and performance of 5G and be the lead innovator in 6G space.

\- Not related to the above, but I think that they may give an update on the profitability of their new-ish cash flow monster, ReefShark. It is dramatically helping their bottom line, and if they have anything favorable to share in regards to it since their last ER, they should definitely add it to the event.

**The valuation is absolutely broken here.**

Nok's current valuation is absolutely broken. If you want a deeper dive into it, look at my last post. Long story short, they are getting similar valuation to grocery chain companies, and less than half of the valuation as some of their industry peers. The market has just been constantly dumping on them since they lost the contract with Verizon, but I think it has gone way too far. In my eyes, NOK is a cutting edge technology company, but they just aren't getting that sort of respect.

**STIMULUS!!!!!**

The next stimulus bill has already passed the House and is currently working it's way through the Senate. It should (fingers crossed) pass the Senate, then go back to the House for another round to reconcile the two bills. If all goes somewhat how most people think it will, these $1400 checks will hit people's accounts the week of 3/19 (remember all those call options)...yeah...**this could be fun!!!** üöÄüöÄ 

**MOAR STIMULUS!!!!!**

If you read my last post, you would have seen that I said that Biden is a big fan of infrastructure, and that he is also terrified of China ""eating our lunch"" if we don't spend on infrastructure. Well guess what, he's already started meetings to get an infrastructure bill in motion...

[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-biden-pushes-infrastructure-in-bipartisan-meeting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-biden-pushes-infrastructure-in-bipartisan-meeting)

A big chunk of this bill is going to go to the usual infrastructure items (roads, bridges, etc.), but on Biden's campaign page, it literally mentions building out a more robust 5G network on the infrastructure tab. Don't be surprised if you see a massive amount of $$$$ go towards 5G buildout.

I don't know what else there is to say. The price on NOK just doesn't make sense, and the more DD I do, the sillier it looks. You've got some analysts projecting up to 150% CAGR in 5G/6G networks over the next 5-10 years. On top of that, you've got the entire planet transitioning to more data intensive activities (autonomous everything, more people permanently WFH, etc.).

TL:DR - I may have eaten too many crayons in my life, but even I can put together that NOK is gonna go üöÄüöÄüöÄ at some point this year or next, and I've got a lot staked that the first stage ignition happens on 3/18-3/19.",My last NOK DD post...I promise. Maybe.,0.79,1614908758,clash_jeremy

75,ly14x0,"**Definition**

Beta Slippage is defined as the multi-day tracking inefficiency from investing in levered funds. Said another way, due to how some leveraged funds rebalance, you will lose money due to compounding that doesn't track the original underlying. This slippage gets worse when the leverage is greater or returns on the underlying are more volatile.

As an example calculation, suppose you have stock A and ETF B that is 3x levered to A, and daily rebalanced to ensure a daily 3x starting point.

**Ex 1: A goes up 10% day 1 and down 10% day 2**

A = 1 \* 1.1 \* .9 = .99 -&gt; A lost 1%

B = 1 \* 1.3 \* .7 = .91 -&gt; B lost 9%

**Ex 2: A goes up 25% day 1 and down 20% day 2**

A = 1 \* 1.25 \* .8 = 1 -&gt; A is flat

B = 1 \* 1.75 \* .4 = .7 -&gt; B lost 30%

Your levered fund can lose money even if the underlying is flat day over day. Now, let's get a bit more realistic, and let's minimize our downsize DoD. To do this, one way would be to have the underlying be SPX, which has circuit breakers that will close the market for the day at 20%.

**Ex 3: A goes up 1% day 1 and down 1% day 2**

A = 1 \* 1.01 \* .99 = .9999 -&gt; A lost .01% or 1 bp

B = 1 \* 1.03 \* .97 = .9991 -&gt; B lost 9 bps

How often does this happen or something less bad? About 70% of the time market moves are between -1 to 1%. 30% of the time the slippage would be worse, granted it can work in your favor if the market only goes up.

**Ex 4: A goes up 10% day 1 and up 10% day 2**

A = 1 \* 1.1 \* 1.1 = 1.21 -&gt; A is up 21%

B = 1 \* 1.3 \* 1.3 = 1.69 -&gt; A is up 69% or 6% more than you might expect if you were just doing 3A as an estimate.

This clearly overestimates the benefits as the typical day is not 10% up.

The question becomes, are we green more than we are red and does the distribution of returns on average render beta slippage to be near 0? Well, you actually have to run some trials, I look at the worst point in history for this trade below.

A quick side note, SPXL has a high expense ratio, 1.01%, and is often shorted -&gt; Why? Because people attempt to long the other end and just pick up the beta slippage component from shorting SPXL, but it's very expensive to short SPXL.

**The Trade Premise**

Just but SPXL and keep holding. Don't look at your account cause you can lose 96% of it in some cases if you are the world's worst market timer.

**What about Downturns?**

Well, let's consider, literally, your worst possible scenario so far, you bought in for $1 on October 9th, 2007 and you just held and you just kept holding. Well, at some point, March 9th, 2009, you had 4c, but if you continued to hold, today, you'd have $2.30. Now, what about if you had just bought SPX rather than the SPXL version, you indeed would have done better, you would have $2.43. That's a 13% better return over all of those years because you *did not* buy SPXL.

**However-** This is the worst scenario in history thus far - that was the largest peak to trough we have ever seen (since the great depression), but there were no circuit breakers then. Suppose you instead bought in some random day in 2006, call it the beginning of '06, you'd have $3.9 for SPXL vs $2.97 for SPX. A 93% return difference between the two on a $1.

**How does this trade fail?**

Pretty easily, if the distribution of returns changes to be a tad more swingy overall, beta slippage increases significantly and you'll lose out, and if average returns are negative, this strategy is horrendous. However, I'm all about relative wealth concerns. If the SPX is doing well, I'd like to be doing even better. How about if the SPX is on a long-term decline and it will, literally, never recover? I probably have bigger things to worry about than my cash in my investment account, so I don't mind being wrong.

Note - I did not take into consideration the expense ratio when calculating the above. Does it likely have a bigger impact than you'd expect, yes, does it turn the investment negative vs SPX in the long-run? I don't think so.  


Edit: I can't comment on this post lol my comment karma is too low, automod removes it, so one more point here:

 An additional note, while dollar-cost averaging underperforms lump-sum investing for investing in SPX (widely researched - but it's pretty simple right, on average the market goes up, so you'd want your money in as soon as possible) - this is **NOT** true for SPXL. DCA outperforms over the long run because buying in a downturn for SPXL turns out to be extremely profitable and mistiming your bets kills your overall return.
