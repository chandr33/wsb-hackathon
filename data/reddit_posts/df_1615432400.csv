0,m2gj88,"New trader here, started about a month ago, and I’ve been all red across my chart since tilray dumped. Most of what I bought are meme stocks, which I bought impulsively as I saw positive mention (save your shit wife’s boyfriend has already scolded me). 

I’m currently on the wall about HGSH. I bought at its peak and it dropped 30% and has stayed there for weeks (I’ve missed the few spikes but none surfaced to where I bought at). Shitty enough that’s where a majority of my portfolio is at.

What do y’all with experience use to determine your outing when it comes to losses? No financial advice—just your own experiences. When do you take significant losses and hold? When do you take them and eat them? What resources do y’all use to make your determination? I only lost like 100, so in the grand scheme of things, I can deal with selling, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

Their hands slowly turning into diamonds.

But then, below my sweet monkey ass.

I could feel it.

The rumbling.

The heat permeating upwards.

Their chants growing stronger. 

A million apes strong.

Each one of them with a green crayon in their mouth.

The monkey noises soon became all I could hear, all around me.

They were near. 

I prepared my asshole knowing this might be it.

Suddenly it hit me. 

A million retarded apes chanting.

Their uncoordinated screeches somehow harmonizing. 

All around me, shit slinging and green crayons being thrown violently.

Rocket fuel burning my ape body to a crisp.

And almost as soon as they arrived I turned to see that they were gone.

I could barely hear their chants anymore.

But I now, I feel them inching closer by the minute.

Tonight I rest, with the faint sound echoing below me. 

I know my time is soon. 

Above me, only retards. 

I can feel Andromeda calling for me.

Here it is, take a call you don’t have and sell it. Yeah short sell a call. When would you do something so stupid and ridiculous as that? Well I wish I was paying attention today to lightly test it out. 

At 348 GME dropped. If really soon after I noticed this drop went and sold a couple calls that were just in the money, then buy them back at the bottom I could have made a few 100s of that. Sadly I did not own any calls for GME when this happened so I have no numbers to go off.

However I do have amc. If I had noticed the drop and enacted this I would have made $100 for each and every call I shorted. 

Looks at the absolute monster predictions that are out there about the high price per stock. Theoretically I could make a few thousand off each call if I do this as the squeeze winds down. The question is will there be calls available to do this to that high up?

Honest answer probably not, the risk would be massive. Be like trying to guess where a run away train will stop, it will just keep going past you and with this squeeze you have a infinite number of times to be wrong. 

On the other hand the MM might just be greedy enough to try and scam people by writing calls that can never be reached realistically...... until it happens.

There has been no recent news about the company that could have led to such strong gains. However, it is necessary to note that Coin Citadel operates in the fast-growing crypt mining sector, and in recent times many coin mining companies have seen their stocks soar.

82,m2gsoj,"The TLDR is short and sweet gents... I think **$GNOG** aka **GOLDEN NUGGET ONLINE GAMING** could be the best performing stock in the entire market over the next few weeks. This is an online casino company, like if if Robinhood made an app specifically for gambling online (which is now legal in several states across the U.S). Rather than drowning you retards in a bunch of complicated DD and technical charts, I present below - for all your smooth-brained viewing pleasure - EVERY near-term catalyst in play right now. 

🎰 Earnings report for Q4 and all 2020 - guidance for revs AND earnings up 60%+ YoY 🔥💰📊 

🎰 Additional analyst coverage and PTs likely 1-2 days after earnings 👔📝🎯 

🎰 NJ online gambling figures for Feb - recall GNOG is the 👑 of NJ, by far the largest and most profitable player, and in Jan the number 2 player who is supposed to be “catching up” actually grew slower than GNOG 🤣🥇 

🎰 Michigan figures for Feb - recall this is MI’s 2nd month in history and the total industry did $30M+ in the first 10 days of Jan vs. NJ (most mature market) did $100M in all of Jan.. oh and for the haters who say DKNG did 10x as much rev as GNOG in Jan, they also spent 10x as much in promos 😂 🥇  

🎰 Imminent PR announcing formal launch in PA, where GNOG is already approved to operate and expected to go live any day now. ⏰🔓 

🎰 Possibly EXPLOSIVE meme potential as GNOG has been one of the to top trending stocks on Twitter and is beginning to show up more and more on Reddit / WSB posts. Basically, GNOG is a WSB autist meme stock in its purest form: it is by far the most simple, accessible, and infectious way for degenerate gamblers to gamble on a gambling stock. It's name also happens to translate to Golden Tendies Online Gaming Stonk...

🎰 Finally, GNOG is led by a dude named Tilman Fertitta (literally cannot go tit's up), a self-made billionaire, visionary entrepreneur, and overall man of the people with major ""F You"" money and a business empire spanning casinos, hotels, restaurants, and, oh right, he happens to own the Houston ROCKETS. 🚀🚀🚀 Fertitta goes on CNBC every few weeks to pump his various enterprises, with the last appearance on March 2nd, so we may see him again as soon as this Tuesday 3/16. 

Oh and did I mention warrants expired 2 days ago and we are still 45% below our ATH? 😏

In terms of timing, I expect most, if not all of these to occur in the next \~2 weeks or so, so pick up as many March and April calls as you can, strap on your retard helmets and get ready for a wild ride...",$GNOG - If DFV and Cathie Wood had a love child and named it Golden Nugget Online Gaming,1.0,1615433304,secondhandsondek

95,m2gujt,"GME has been a crazy ride so far, but I'm here to explain why it dipped using advanced level TA. If you look at the first chart you'll notice that my portfolio has a strong resistance at $1200. Today, GME tested the 1200 resistance level in my portfolio as seen here in the second image. When it tried to break past the resistance level it was violently rejected. 

The 3rd chart shows why I'm still extremely bullish on GME. If you look at the chart it shows the formation of a standard U pattern with a short bullish wedge forming. The U pattern and the upward line from the wedge show create two parallel lines just like a Crayola has.  Today, someone ate a green crayola, showing that the chart is soon to be green. 

The price target is pretty simple. I started with $10,000 and am currently holding 2 shares. If you 10,000 to the power of 2, you get 100,000 which explains where my portfolio is heading. I know some of you don't believe in TA, so I'll add an extra for you guys. See that sharp turn downwards, you can say it drilled down. What do you put on the end of drills? Diamond bits. Diamonds. Diamond hands. 

The chart is clearly showing GME is a hold status until 100,000.
