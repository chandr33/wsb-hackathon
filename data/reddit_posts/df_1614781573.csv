9,lwv46x,"I know we like to say ""I like the stock"" around here. But in the case of Doordash, I just really hate this stock.

I've seen other DD on here about this play but here's a quick rundown:

* It's trading at about 20x sales
* High competition market (GrubHub, Uber Eats, Postmates, Waitr, Bite Squad, etc.)
* Coming off of a great sales year because people were stuck at home and forced to use their product, growth is already expected to slow going forward.
* IPO Lockup expiring March 9th which will free up about 40% of existing shares.

The only people who I can find who are bullish on this name are either bagholders or the IPO underwriters. With that being said, I wanted to buy a $170 put when this was at $200 last week but I pussed out because the premiums looked high and there was a wide bid-ask spread. Now it's at about $160 and I'm looking at either the $150 or $155 put for March 19. I believe another 7% drop is absolutely attainable between now and then. Look at how Palantir tanked after their lockup expiration, and that's a revolutionary tech company with hugely bullish backers (Cathie)

This would be my first time buying puts, so I wanted to run the idea through here to make sure there was still upside for this play, as we're getting closer to the expiry date. If anyone has any other ideas for strikes and prices feel free to share!

No positions in $DASH currently but I will update if I do jump in today

EDIT: Just dipped my toe in with one DASH 3/19 $140P. Still looking at adding more at different strikes as we move closer to lockup expiry.",Thinking about buying puts on DoorDash? ($DASH),0.84,1614781625,Florida_Knight77

14,lwv4fv,"* Tesla needs more iron *

 Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has indicated in the past that the company will move away from nickel-cathode batteries due to supply shortages, and CEO Elon Musk recently reiterated this in a tweet.

 Nickel supply bottlenecks are the biggest concern for Tesla as it scale up lithium-ion cell production.

 That would be the reason why Tesla is switching its models with standard range to iron cathodes.  Musk also suggested that the use of lithium iron phosphate or LFP batteries will free up more battery supplies of lithium ion chemistry cells with nickel cathodes for the company's other vehicle programs.

 Golden times for iron ore exploration companies like * Manning Ventures (NASDAQ: Manning Ventures), which today announced its exploration plans for the two iron ore projects in Quebec.

 In a nutshell: data analysis, preparatory work to identify the best drilling targets, then drilling program.  Corona cannot interfere here: Exploration work is systemically relevant!

 https://www.onvista.de/news/irw-news-manning-ventures-inc-manning-ventures-praesentiert-explorationsplaene-fuer-seine-eisenerzprojekte-in-quebec-438178655

 CEO Alex Klenman said: ""... we believe that these projects and * other additional corporate initiatives we are pursuing in this area * will have a positive impact on our market capitalization in the near future ...""

 That sounds like further acquisitions to me.  Think big!

 * Very exciting iron ore play with a 1st price target of 2.50 CAD by the end of 2021 / Buy up to 0.30 euros. *",Manning Ventures news,0.45,1614781642,Plastic-Reputation63
