14,mgpq2v," Varonis is a pioneer in data security and analytics, fighting a different battle than conventional cybersecurity companies such as Okta, Crowdstrike, and many others. 

This company is the leader in user behavior analytics which uses AI to determine abnormal user behavior in a computer network.

The company just did a 3 for 1 stock split and is trading at 25% below analyst price targets of $66-$83.

Their most recent earnings call destroyed analyst estimates coming in at double expectations.

11 of 12 analysts have this at a buy or strong buy with one at neutral.  [https://www.benzinga.com/stock/vrns/ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/vrns/ratings)

The stock has had a nice profit taking sell off and is down about 10% from the split price.

18,mgpr4j,"ALL HAIL SUE! Lets face it: shareholders love Sue. And for good reason. Since Sue has taken the reigns at COTY, the stock is up almost 50%.

Still, a long way to go at just $9. Trade volume looking nice recently at 6 million. COTY is a massive player in the beauty industry but because of poor business decisions by previous CEO, its taken a tumble. 

This is where THE Sue Nabi comes in. You see, Sue is the reason you know the name L’OREAL Paris. She is a veteran in the beauty industry and has what it takes to not only take the company around...BUT TO MAKE US TENDIES. COTY is the world leader in fragrance and as people go out more, you damn right they are trying to smell good. And they will spend with COTY to make it happen. The problem with COTY is its past. Good thing they literally have THE BEST person in charge to make this work. Recent price targets have COTY going to $12. Thats the bear case. Of course its hard to think COTY could go to ULTA prices but like I said in the beginning, shareholders LOVE Sue. Check out the movements recently, its beautiful. COTY will continue to deliver for its shareholders and most likely will climb higher as more people come aware of the POWER OF SUE!",COTY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0.99,1617137619,abishop717

So, we’ve been talking about the whole situation and the stir that WSB has created in Wall Street. She is a bit older and doesn’t really understand what is going on with this site or sub. However, she mentioned to her boss that I have been part of this sub and that I am active in it. 

Her boss mentioned that he has been trying to follow us but doesn’t really understand the platform or our. He is a frat bro GenX’r and caters to boomers, so he is only tech savvy with the specific software that the company uses as well as other news sites/apps that keep him up to date with the market. He always hires Frat bros and Kids of his (wealthy) friends as interns. Because he thinks that Chadbros, Stacies, and Frat bros make it in the industry better than most.

He is now planning on hiring a “Techy” (he used this fucking word and it made me cringe) person to use and follow this Sub and understand us Tards. No fucking joke! He wants to hire a guy to just troll Reddit and figure out what the fuck we are up to. 

Then he basically said that he wanted someone $YUNGer and more autistic than me who can actually understand what we do and then break it down to him (this I’m paraphrasing). He really is overestimating our collective intelligence...

So, just letting all you $YUNGer folks that are looking for internships in the financial sector, your job this summer may not be to just bring the wrong coffee order and tickle the $ANUS of your superiors with your 💋. You might have to spend it here in this sub of 📯🐂, 🌈🐻, and 🦍 all summer. I hope you have fun and realize that you might be tard like the rest of us. And follow the rules because the SEC will shove a green 🍆  up your $ANUS if you step out of line.
