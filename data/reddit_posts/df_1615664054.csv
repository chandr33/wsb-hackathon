55,m4dx0o,"Best case scenario is we get a squeeze within the next few months. The worse case scenario is another round of paperhands (due to the attention we're getting) causing another selloff. But, here's the kicker:

It literally doesn't matter. Yes, I believe the stock will squeeze, and soonish, but let's consider a hypothetical situation in which we squeeze up a bit and these little paperhands sell off enough to cause panic (I realize this kind of sentiment is against the status quo here) -- this cycle will likely just continue. Shorts will be too proud to cover, stock will dip and then slowly rise, more will fomo in, and the cycle will repeat. This'll happen over and over again I'd imagine.

What I'm getting at is that the Hedge Funds just need to realize this will never end. We *know* they're completely underwater. We smell blood in the water. Delay it as much as you can, I guess, but we're gonna get that ass.

Regardless, hold and buy. Tendies await us.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: To be clear, holding *through* dips is paramount. It helps the MOASS which will bless you with infinite tendies, but also, trying to time any cycle can cause you to miss out on said unlimited tendies. I'm merely hypothetically speaking about worst case scenario which isn't all that bad, regardless.",This won't end until Hedge Funds exit their short positions,0.84,1615665262,Piccolo_Alone

76,m4e2q6,"It is entirely your money on the line. Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.

But the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it. I am turning 25 on the 23rd (Daddy Cohen is gifting me an earnings report ☺) and even just 5k is a huge play on my part. Be smarter than me; be an autist.

God speed, retards.

P.S. Mad respect to the dude who convinced his girlfriend to tattoo her ass. That was hilarious.

93,m4e784,"LLY is the maker of PROZAC and if you are anything like me you feel like you need some after not buying GME at $5 .. Should you buy GME after it rose 50x ? I'm kinda scared to do that even though I'm a retard. And I hope I'm wrong and GME rises another 50x for all the APES that are in YOLO positions.

AMC is only up 5x and holding $10.25 WHICH is possibly bullish. So, we can all pop a prozac and go the movies and escape our sour thoughts on missing out on the GME frenzy :) .. This will help both those stocks if you feel like they are a good alternate investment. Time to cheer up the old fashioned way :)
