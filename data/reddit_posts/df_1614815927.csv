83,lx86md,"It’s quite obvious that since January there has been a MASSIVE influx of new members to WSB. As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I’m concerned about how that’s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.

Nowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don’t mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. 

AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY. WHILE GAMESTOP💎🙌🏿 IS A GREAT VEHICLE TO DO THAT, IT IS NOT THE ONLY MEANS OF MAKING MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.

While I am saying all this, there really isn’t any real way (that I can think of at least) to remedy this issue and this post probably won’t get the publicity and visibility that it needs to make a change. However, I want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there. Long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain OPEN MINDED. Allow there to be room on the sub for genuinely great ideas to grow and flourish and receive the attention they deserve.
