5,lwvezn,"Felt compelled to start a discussion given I can’t find any mainstream analysis regarding what I think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make.

Everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space, Albemarle (ALB), SQM, Ganfeng etc. and even the smaller speculative players. However it seems there is one mining company that’s flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what I think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world. Let me tell you about IGO limited (ASX:IGO) and the deal they made to cut into Greenbushes.

Greenbushes mine (Located in Western Australia) is operated by Talison Lithium, a joint venture by Tianqi (controlling share) and Albemarle. Tianqi bought some shares in SQM at the height of the last lithium boom, but since then prices have fallen flat and Tianqi is fucked with debt. They needed a lifeline, and in December 2020 IGO was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future. For about 1.3 billion, they secured part of a very valuable asset, let me explain below.

Greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining, and (depending on who you ask) is the largest such mine on earth. Raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate. From there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide, the most sought after lithium-based component for EV batteries.

That is one method of mining lithium.

The other way is via brining. Brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of South America, which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed. However, I think that when the supply crunch comes, brine mining will be be disfavored by EV and battery manufacturers. Let me explain below:

Hard rock vs brine:

Hard Rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield. It is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather. It does not require massive amounts of water, and it’s environmental costs are relatively pedestrian (compared to brining)

Brine Mining has a higher production cost but a higher output. However, it is affected by inclement weather (likely to become a problem over the next 10 years imo), requires massive amounts of water, and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks
[source ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact). Given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples, I don’t think it is viable in the green future. EV and battery makers will feel pressure (and may even face regulation) that their supply chain is carbon neutral, green etc. When you consider why the EV revolution is happening, it doesn’t make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water, a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next 15 years. There is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining, but personally, I don’t know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by ~2025.

Now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mine’s lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide, it is the HIGHEST margin product in the lithium trade. Can’t post the graphic but it’s in this source, along with other great info [source](https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/Lithium-brine-vs-hard-rock-demo-confirmation-MJ-ad.html) Brining can also yield Lithium hydroxide, but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so.

So, now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available. Greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle. The plant is called Kwianna and was solely owned by Tianqi. Until IGO came in.

For 1.3 Billion, IGO secured 24.99% stake in greenbushes mine and 49% of Kwianna lithium hydroxide plant. What’s interesting is that Ablemarle tried to buyout Tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of 2020. From my POV, this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is. Thankfully, the IGO-Tianqi deal was structured in a way that, per ABL spokesman, didn’t trigger the right of first refusal clause. Speculation is that China was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant, which makes me think that if Tianqis financial troubles continue, IGO could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and Kwianna.

tl;dr Brine mining has credible downsides that I believe are being overlooked, which could make hard rock miners more desirable by EV/battery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition. Greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and (I believe) one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated. IGO is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running - 25% of the mine and 50% of the refinery. It is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets, and I don’t understand why that is.

Relatively new to investing and posting, so if there is a reason that IGO isn’t a worthwhile play please enlighten me.

Position: holding long 550 shares @ $5.41 USD and buying more when I can. Can’t post the OTC ticker as I don’t want this post to get removed, PM me if you want it.

Not financial advice, I like the stock.",I think IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable EV revolution - High Level DD,0.72,1614782449,VeniceKing719
