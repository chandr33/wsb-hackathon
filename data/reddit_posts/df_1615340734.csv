pretty simple format too for those limited on how many words they know

ITM @ 245 (current price as of market close 3/9/21)= 35,540 calls (35,540,000 shares for those new)

OTM

@ $600 strike: 64,167 calls

@ $700 strike: 66,369 calls

@ $800 strike: 90,484 calls

TL,Dont understand it: if it gets to $350 per share at End of Market Friday then 52m shares can be exorcised ""in the money"" (forced buy). The significance of that is that there are 69.75m existing shares minus insiders (not tradable stocks) 19.06m which is 50.69m shares.

SO, every ""actual available""  share in existence can be bought this Friday theoretically

I was taught to show your work so here you go lmao

93,m1mm4c,"A medium sized hedge-fund comprises of say 1,000-10,000 investors at say 200k - $1,000,000 each. 

1,000 investors x $200,000 cash each = $200,000,000

That's 200 million in liquidity, on the conservative scale.

Many funds will have have members well over $1,000,000 each - remember, Griffin himself earned 1.8 billion, that's $5 million a day! (Yes, the numbers are astronomical, after all old, old Karl Marx said that the elite will jam in the power wedge as hard as they possibly can aka $$$). 

Let's pivot this discussion for a second. 

The burst of retail traders has rocked the market. But why and how?

Well, it's simply a change in values on the number of investors and their individual portfolio size.

Taking the above calculation, we see that:

9,480,162 wsb members x $100 each =  $948,0162,000. A billion! *strength in numbers*

Let's pivot again to the concept of the ""free market"".

Well, for the first time in history, the plebs can trade equities! Did Marx see that one coming?! Plebs can freely participate in the market, assign value to equities, and actually compete with the proletariats based on strength in numbers. 

Just check out the numbers:

1,000,000 wsb users x $1,000 = $1 Billion

10,000,000 retail investors x $1,000 = $10 Billion

100,000,000 retail investors x $1,000 = $100 Billion (ka ching!)

or

10,000,000 retail investors x $10,000 = $100 Billion (ka ching!)
