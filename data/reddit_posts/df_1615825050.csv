RIDE next huge Short Squeeze target?
It was added to Hindenburg Research’s Short-Sell Hit List

[Article here](https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-short-seller-hindenburg-adds-lordstown-hit-list/)

[And here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lordstown-stock-falls-20-after-short-seller-says-electric-truck-is-a-mirage-11615566973)

One of our favorite EV stocks, RIDE, was added to Hindenburg Research’s Short Sell hit list. This is the same Hindenburg Research that shorted Nikola into oblivion and caused its stock price crash, among many other companies. On 3/12, RIDE Price dropped from $17.81 to $14.22 overnight.

Honestly, I, and a lot of other people, listened to their research and posts thinking/hoping that they were just trying to do us retail investors a solid and let us in on important information and a good exit on a bad stock. Lately, though, I’m starting to feel like they’re just another Melvin and they’re acting like all of these Hedge Funds that release ‘news’ so they can capitalize on their short sells and make money off of us.

The company is still a solid investment no matter how Hindenburg tries to spin it. You literally couldn’t go wrong by holding it.

But, if you’re looking for another Short Squeeze stock, this would be a good one to get into at a discount and make some money off of so that we can all dump some more money into GME.",Lordstown Motors (RIDE) heavily shorted by Hindenburg,1.0,1615825068,MasterTmax

I’m sick and tired of hearing the narrative passed around:

 “Hurr durr Nokia Float too big- Nokia never move”

Here are some fun facts as of writing this post:

1) Regardless of how “large the float is”, Nokia’s market cap right now is ~24 billion and is trading at $4.30/share. 

2) Guess what hot company everyone has loved FOMOing into for the last 3 months? GME. Do you retards want to know what the market cap is for GME right now? ~25 billion while trading at $250/share. 

Quite literally the only thing required for Nokia to move at the same rate as GME is for buyers to buy ~58 shares of Nokia for every one share you’d have bought of GME. You’d have spent literally the same amount on your investment with either choice. 

Not only that, but as you’d have more shares amassed in quantity, when Nokia’s value is recognized and it booms, you’ll be able to make even MORE cash by selling covered calls against your shares. 

If you wanted even more leverage, because I know you retards do, you could buy LEAPs now, and sell calls against them either now or in the future after the leaps have appreciated massively in value. 

And, make no mistake, Nokia is set to boom. They just announced major deals today with the biggest tech companies in the world- Amazon, Microsoft, Google. That’s not even mentioning the non-stop contracts they’ve won globally the last few months- major contracts. The investing community is ignoring this diamond in the rough, but those that get in now on the ground floor are the ones that are going to see significant returns. 

Do your own DD. Make your own decisions. But...

For fucks sake, inform yourselves on what it takes to move a companies shares price. All Nokia needs is buying volume and a willingness for investors to recognize the value staring them in the face. 

I recommend both shares and LEAPs as the plays here.

53,m5om2b,"I’m sorry, is it not obvious that AMC is the ultimate distraction? It’s a company that has released hundreds of millions of shares during this spike and have paid their executives millions in bonuses. The amount of dilution means that a squeeze is impossible. And if the reason you are buying is because of the dip in price because of the pandemic, the value of the company would be double its pre-pandemic valuation at 5$ a share. In the last final attempt of the hedgefunds to get us to sell is to spike AMC as it has had a lot of genuine support from us in the past. However, the narrative on AMC has changed. It is not a solid play and it does nothing but pull money from GameStop. I understand the desire of people to make the case for AMC, I, like many, bought into AMC around 14 and have been holding the bag for about a month now. Just because I have stake in AMC doesn’t mean I’m right and it doesn’t mean it’s going up. Don’t be blinded by your current positions, sunk costs and all that. You have a chance to become millionaires with GME, don’t through that away for a company that has massively diluted then interest of their existing shareholders.

**Financial Disclaimer**

* This is definitely not financial advice, the associated volatility and risk is much more substantial than your average trade. Precede with caution! 

&amp;#x200B;

* Over the past few weeks I have been critically reflecting and decided to pen down my thoughts on a prospective medium to long term stock play for RIOT.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro** 

* My fellow apes, did you miss your ticket to the moon/ still holding your ticket to mars with GME? Well here is a brand new prospective play that I have put some thought into. This aint no ticket to mars thou, RIOT is a fucking ticket to Uranus (the furthest we will go).

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamental Analysis of BT( and correlation stock play RIOT (The future of digital gold, the greatest prospect of our generation) - RIOT**

* With Biden signing the 1.9 Trillion USD covid relief into law, an estimated 17 million people  will receive $1400 USD as their discretionary income. With the meme-fication of the stock market, investment has gained traction among the younger generations of millennials and gen z. Reports predict that  most of COVID relief checks will contribute to rent and essentials, but a growing proportion of the population will use this ‘free discretionary income’ to put into the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

* Linking this to Bitcojn and riot, Raconteur research infographic has demonstrated that it is the newer generations that are most interested and most likely to get into crypt0 or crypt0 related investments. With Riot’s earnings report releasing on March 31st that works in conjunction with all these events, the potential for a spike could be significant.

&amp;#x200B;

* In terms of a longer outlook on bitcojn, the influx of big institutional buyers and interests (MicroStrategy, tesla, galaxy digital holdings, ruffer investment company, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan) has solidified bitcojn’s position as a ‘holdable-asset’. Either for long-term capital growth, or an inflationary hedging asset (with a faster than expected rebound of the global economy, interest rate and inflationary increase is a major concern for institutional players).

&amp;#x200B;

* In particular, JPMorgan’s investment instrument that introduces crypt0 proxy stocks where riot contributes 15% of the portfolio will continue to introduce more institution money into the picture, amplifying the returns of RIOT over bitcojn volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Bi’s correction after reaching new historical high is a healthy sign of investment psychology, which also enables a relative entry opportunity in the 5th Elliot wave. 

&amp;#x200B;

**RIOT and BT(  an “unprofessional” Technical Analysis** 

* So we know based on a statistical analysis over the past 2 years that RIOT has over a 90% correlation to BT( prices yet with a 3X relative volatility. - To simply put say BT( increases by 5%, RIOT increases by 15% - 3 times relative more. Why is this the case? Simply put RIOT has a much smaller mkt cap compared to BT( therefore it takes less cash inflow to increase the share price. 

&amp;#x200B;

* With this in mind the technical analysis will focus primarily on BT( as it is the core driver of RIOT stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

* Elliott Wave Analysis - “The Elliott Wave Principle posits that collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences. These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.” - Straight from Wikipedia.

&amp;#x200B;

* Typically there are 5 Elliot waves before a slight correction. As illustrated in the diagram we have just entered wave 5! This means we can expect a bullish momentum in the market up to the possible price target of 115K USD which is the key -2.0 fib extension level.  But hey if you get em diamonds hands the sky's the limit and -2.618 is definitely possible boys which will see BT( at 131k.

&amp;#x200B;

* Fib Retracement - The Fib levels are key areas of support and resistance. The start of the 5th Elliot wave was propagated by a retracement of the 0.5 KEY Fib resistance level in confluence with large institutions ( i.e Papa ELON) buying in. Elon giveth, Elon taketh, papa elon bless thy gains.

&amp;#x200B;

* The recent onboarding on large institutions including banks such as JP Morgan offering debt instruments which constitute crypt0 related stocks (where RIOT constitutes 15% of the instrument) further allows boomers to diversify into such stocks, creating a long term demand and driving up prices of RIOT.

&amp;#x200B;

**RIOT, shit is getting serious, the setup**

* It can't be  stressed enough, but just think of this RIOT play on a macro physiological level. We have the largest of the largest companies and institutions buying into a limited supply asset BT(. We have boomers slowing turning over and buying into crypt0 related stocks through Big Banks such as JP Morgan's  crypt0 debt instrument. We have retail investors - the diamond hands GME bag holders with a Hella of a strong APE mentality. And RIOT the fucking company which mines and sells this increasing valued asset, digital gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Think about this fucking insane unprecedented surge in demand into BT( which is limited in supply. Guess what happens a fucking insane parabolic move upwards. And RIOT the most prominent BT( mining company which mines BT( constantly with insane relative stock volatility. RIOT is going to the moon guys are you hopping on that ride? LMK if my analysis is trash but i firmly believe we are standing at the crossroads of history which side are you going to be on? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitors and why RIOT is the king of BT( mining**

* So now you are asking yourself is MARA or RIOT the better stock correlation play to BT(? MARA has seen to have high compensation packages, 2 share dilutions in a span of several months - while they have the largest expansions their ongoing costs are astronomical, their increase in cost for mining was a larger increase than their increase in rev for BT(.

&amp;#x200B;

* MARA while having the potential for the highest hash rate is just too risky in my uneducated financial opinion. RIOT has stronger fundamentals with strong leadership, the number of share dilutions is only one at a much smaller mkt cap indicating that they clearly value shareholder wealth perseverance more than MARA, and do not rely on equity financing at the expense of shareholders as much as MARA does.

&amp;#x200B;

* RIOT looks like the more sturdy rocket ship that would get you from earth to the moon and then fucking mars. A year from now when  possibly BT( is up over several 100k and RIOT the BT( miner becomes possibly worth over  $1000 per share then we can look back and remember our fallen GME, AMC, NOK and BB brothers and tell them hey we fucking made it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion, RIOT to the moon?**

* Stay strong fellow apes and always remember “we can remain retarded longer than shorts (BT( naysayers) can remain solvent”.  We like the stock plain and simple, RIOT to the fucking moon?

&amp;#x200B;

* Just a reminder, this is purely for entertainment purposes, this is very much so an unprofessional financial perspective on RIOT and BT( , do your own due diligence, never invest more money than you are willing/ able to lose in any plays you see on this subreddit.

# Introduction

Allow me to introduce you to a company that you’ve all probably driven past or heard about and never thought much about: The Container Store ($TCS).

This stock is up **91% YTD** when the market is only up 5%. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💵💵💵💵💵

How the **fuck** is that possible? Let me explain.

The Container Store is one of those forgotten specialty retailers especially given this retail-apocalypse that’s been going on for a number of years with a huge body count. Everyone is buying their shit online and quite frankly, not a lot of people give two shits about home organization generally. Then a huge catalyst happened that was a dream fucking come true for $TCS: 

**COVID + People Bored Outta Their Minds + Netflix Binging.**

Netflix Binging? WTF? Yes. Netflix in September released a TV show called: “Get Organized with the Home Edit” where The Container Store had an [exclusive partnership with the show](https://cheddar.com/media/the-container-store-sales-surge-with-netflixs-get-organized-with-the-home-edit). People that were interested in home organization and celebrities like Reese Witherspoon binged the show and loved it. This resulted in sales to skyrocket at The Container Store and the shares skyrocketed from $3 to $8 and kept going up. A lot of investors didn’t think much of it since they thought it was one 15 minutes of fame moments, but they were **WRONG**.

The Container Store increased guidance for their Q3 sales in December to “high teens” from their initial conservative guidance of 5%. In February, they below that number away with 20.5% revenue growth. **Highest ever in the last 4 years (as far back as I went)** Needless to say, the stock surged after earnings 🚀🚀🚀.

# The New Captain

In December 2020, The Container Store announced their long-time CEO Melissa Reiff was stepping down and [Satish Malhotra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-malhotra-1227793/) would be replacing her.

So who is this Satish fellow? Well, apparently he worked at Sephora for **21 years** where he started as a manager and then moved his way up to Chief Retail Officer &amp; Chief Operating Officer. Sephora for those that don’t know is a fucking huge company. They make over an **estimated $10 billion in revenue a year** with 2,500+ stores. **So to say the least, it would seem like Satish knows retail and knows his shit** especially coming from such a behemoth like Sephora to the little likes of The Container Store (\~$1 B revenue and 70 or so stores).

He’s also got skin in the game. He’s going to be CEO for at least 5 years per his employment agreement, $875k in salary, **200% performance bonus AND \~50,000 shares (cost basis of around $10).** They also threw him a $1 M signing bonus. To say the least, it would seem The Container Store wanted him and made it worth his while.

**With 50,000 fucking shares and upwards to a 200% performance bonus, this guy WANTS to make things work** and so far, his shares are worth 80% more given $TCS huge surge since the announcement back in December.

# The Financials &amp; Fundamentals

From a fundamentals perspective, The Container Store is definitely still in the midst of a turnaround. 2020 was a banner year that enabled them to greatly reduce their long-term debt. In fact, they actually shaved just about $140 M in debt (40% of total debt) since last March and since Q4 is their biggest earnings period (Their Q4 ends in March), they should finish the year with around $150-175 M in debt, down from $333 M last year.

The Container Store has grown revenue 5% in Q2, 20.5% in Q3 and is **forecasting between 20-25% in Q4.** They will likely outperform their guidance by a bit, so they will likely finish FY 2020 with just shy of $1 billion in revenue. Think about it, to go from 4-5% for the past 4+ years to all of a sudden 20% is HUGE.

**Their gross margins have been insanely fucking stable and are ROCK SOLID** for the past few years and while they are seeing some margin pressure due to increasing freight rates, they are able to offset that with less promotional activities and better product mixes.

What’s incredible about the turnaround thus far is their **operating cash flow is AMAZING right now 💸💸💸**. They generated 17% operating cash flow as a percent of revenue which is pretty strong imo since it has enabled them to really reduce debt.

They are definitely showing some **solid OPERATING LEVERAGE** (where expenses as a % of revenue goes down due to strong revenue growth) with SG&amp;A down to 42.8% vs. 49% last quarter and historically. 

Finally, their **online sales growth grew 98% this most recent quarter and now makes up 28% of overall business.**

# Valuation

$TCS has a TTM P/E ratio of 26 or so currently with a estimated forward P/E ratio of 17 which is **fucking cheap for a company growing 20%+ imo.**

What’s more, given how fast $TCS is growing, it’s possible they will crush their EPS guidance of $0.51-$0.56. Not to mention, total forward EPS INCLUDES the Q1’s terrible earnings report when the US was at the peak of COVID where all stores closed down etc. So “easy comp” for sure this summer which means that if you factor in Q1, $TCS has a forward EPS of 12 which is INSANELY undervalued compared to some of its peers.

All I can say is that if the market continues to give the forward PE ratio $TCS has going forward with no discount, then when Q1 is announced, golden tendies will be here to delight on.

**This is a total mispriced value stock with growth stock revenue guidance.**

# Future Catalysts

**Q4 (JAN to MAR) is The Container Store's biggest quarter** and given that COVID is still a big deal and most people aren’t vaccinated, I think most people stayed home this winter and likely a lot of people home organized. So I think based on their guidance which was given in early February 2021 with already one month in the books, plus the last two weeks of March 2020 being a shitshow, **I think The Container Store will beat Q4 pretty easily.**

In addition, Satish’s start date was February 2021, so he will start making decisions and as noted above, he’s an experienced executive that I believe should have a lot of good ideas to improve 

[**Mario Kondo’s partnership with The Container Store**](http://investor.containerstore.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/The-Container-Store-to-Launch-Exclusive-Product-Line-With-Marie-Kondo/default.aspx?cid=sm%7Clinkedin%7C1020%7Cmkrelease) that was announced in October 2020 began making inventory available starting in January 2021 should be another catalyst

Finally, it’s hard to say if it will happen, but The Home Edit may come back for a second season on Netflix sometime in late 2021, which could help propel earnings even more.

# Short Interest &amp; Daily Volume

The Container Store has an **average volume** of 565k per Yahoo Finance, but it appears it’s closer to 800-1.3 M in recent weeks.

The Short Float is around 11%, so it’s not huge but it isn’t small either. The Days to Cover is actually pretty high given the average volume. It's actually **higher** than some of our favorites.

# In Summary

I think there’s a lot to like given the increased awareness Netflix’s show gave it, people looking to do things, Spring Cleaning, and the new CEO seems to be a fucking rockstar. 

As always, do your own DD since I have not a financial advisor. **I just like this stock.**

If I sell a share at $240 but I paid $49.98 for it I obviously profited $190.02. but if I buy that same share back at $220 then I only profit the $20 difference right? So essentially I gain $20 and have the same # of shares?
