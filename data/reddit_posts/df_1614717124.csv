Hey fellow apes, I’m so frustrated because supposed “Smart money” is less informed than the average retard in this sub, and I’m afraid that this moment in history will largely be remembered as a reddit-fueled p*** that trades on no information. 


The conversation started because I was asking him about his feelings towards the recent GameStop saga. I was looking forward to a conversation where I could get some insight into the way market makers hedge against options, the way short selling (in particular naked short selling) impacts the market and the kind of liability that traders face when making these trades. 

Instead, I was met with grotesque regurgitation of CNBC bullshit, calling us honest retards “Reddit warriors” who trade on “hype” alone. He even brought up the Elon Musk phenomenon, and the meme asset which he has been accused of shilling. He spoke very confidently on the matter, and essentially summed it down to market manipulation led by Reddit bros who have nothing better to do. 

I tried to point out that the recent spike was due to the gamma squeeze rather than because of the shorts covering, and he kept bringing up the fact that “if Reddit had never existed, there would have never been this insane spike”... yeah and if I had a bigger dick my wife wouldn’t need a boyfriend...

It didn’t matter to him that this sub doesn’t discuss anything other than equities, to him, it was all part of the same Reddit-fueled p*** trading on 0 fundamentals. 🤦‍♂️ 

The truth is that if you’re investing time researching the numbers, reading the Bull (and bear 🐻) thesis and spending time actively learning about the current environment, you are the expert on the subject, not any boomer who just happens to have been trading for longer. 

This is not financial advice, or even a prediction of what happens. It’s a rant coming from a misunderstood ape who only wishes that more people were spending time genuinely learning rather than accepting what’s on tv as gospel truth. 

TLDR: No one knows what will happening and very few people (if any) know what’s currently happening. Do your own research (DYOR) and don’t follow your emotions

I'm still in there, but I do not intend on writing again in anyway suggesting that level of short term risk at this price level for any retard here. So onto new things and new sources of tendies!

**TL;DR Silver's global shortage and similarities to previous runs suggest it's due a big move up.**

So here's my next play... one that has been mentioned before on WSB... **SILVER**!

With two fundamental and linked points of reasoning: **global silver shortages** and **historical similarities.**

Firstly there is a global shortage of physical silver. **Silver's paper price simply does not match the price that it can be traded physically**. Look at the premium you pay for buying a coin compared to an ounce on your trading account. People want the physical item to make up for a lack of trust in the dollar (this is not normal as silver price is normally industrial demand led unlike gold). 

People buying silver can hurt the dollar. So you can increase interest rates right? Except you can't, because of the huge US debt. Therefore the only way to stop the dollar shitting itself as people buy silver is to **push the paper price of silver down by shorting the futures**.

Banks want this. In ape terms:

Dollar fall fast =&gt; bond value plummet =&gt; banks very sad

This causes backwardation in the silver market and prolongs the physical shortages. This means the price corrects briefly. It has done this - you can see it on the chart. 

**What comes next?**

**Rocket!** 

In the past 4 cases of backwardation, silver went on to undergo crazy bullish price action. Sounds like a bit of a short squeeze and we do love those here!

**Just like 2011 - Silver is set for a run to $50**. Or maybe more? Just like with RKT I have no idea where the top is but we certainly like ATHs on WSB.

Look at the chart. **Notice a pattern very similar to 2011 when silver ran to $50? Me too.**

UUUU, or Energy Fuels, is a uranium mining company. Why did they have a good day today in a so-so day for the market? Well it must be because all uranium stocks are doing well today, and Energy Fuels is part of that trend, right? Is there anything else?

In my opinion, what makes Energy Fuels special would have to be its entry into REE, otherwise known as Rare Earth Elements. Most people associate only MP Materials (which I bought a lot of earlier this year) with rare earths. MP Materials mines rare earths in the US. UUUU is not a miner of rare earths. So how do they fit in?

In what I view as a very clever arrangement, Energy Fuels has put themselves right in the middle of the value chain for rare earths. You can read [here](https://www.energyfuels.com/2021-03-01-Neo-Performance-Materials-and-Energy-Fuels-Announce-Joint-Launch-of-U-S-European-Rare-Earth-Production-Initiative) their announcement, but here's how it works (skip this part if you're bored): 

tldr: Chemours-&gt;Energy Fuels-&gt;Neo =&gt; non-China rare earths supply chain

1. In December, Energy Fuels announced a supply agreement with Chemours, where Chemours will now ship a minimum of 2,500 tons of Monazite Ore per year to Energy Fuels. Monazite contains rare earths, and previously, Chemours shipped this monazite to China for processing. Chemours has this monazite as a result of its mining operations in the state of Georgia. Energy Fuels is able to process this monazite by removing the uranium (which it then stockpiles for selling later on). 
2. Some important details about the monazite it processes. In one unit of monazite ore from Georgia, there is 53% total rare earth oxide (treo). In this treo, there is 22.6% NdPr (Neodymium Praseodymium) and 14.4% SEG/Heavies (the specific rare earths being mined). Other monazite ores from around the world contain even higher amounts, but that's not important right now.
3. To compare, of the treo in US bastnaesite, which is what MP Materials mines, there is 16.3% NdPr and 1.1% SEG/Heavies. So by this point, we can see that what Energy Fuels produces will be higher quality treo than MP. I mentioned the 2500 tons because even if the treo is higher, what if MP mines more overall? However, the 2500 is a minimum shipping amount that can increase as demand grows, and Energy Fuels can also source monazite from other companies as well. So over the next year, the quantities will converge, but the quality will still be on Energy Fuels' side. 
4. But at this point, both companies are still shipping their REE carbonate to China for processing. This is where the Trump and Biden administrations come in. Both the previous administration and the current administration want to create a US-based supply chain for rare earths. As relations between China and the US deteriorate in the long-term, the US government does not want its rare earths to be beholden to China. MP Materials, according to their own website, still ships their output to China for processing, negating the idea that their rare earth supply chain is US-based.
5. Here's where the announcement yesterday of the partnership with Neo comes in. [Neo](https://www.neomaterials.com/) Performance Materials is a European producer of materials and chemicals for various purposes. They are the last step in the supply chain for creating marketable, usable rare earth elements. Now, Energy Fuels will ship their REE carbonate to Neo for processing. This is the first completely non-China based supply chain for rare earths, which is a high priority for the US government/Biden administration. They currently support Lynas, so the question now is whether Energy Fuels will play a more prominent role in the government's efforts. They have an existing relationship with the government, as you can see through their recent lobbying [efforts](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/20/campaign-contributions/). This article is important to note, as it sheds a light on some not-so-savory relationships. While everything seems above the table and fine, I'm just not a big fan of lobbying and such. However the point I see is that if Energy Fuels has the ability to maintain a rare earths value chain, the US government will pay attention to it. 

Phew, that was a lot. Now let's go through the pros and cons for UUUU. Feel free to add your own too. 

\- Con:

the rare earth supply that UUUU hopes to produce through its partnership with Chemours and Neo is just beginning. It doesn't yet match the output of MP Materials or Lynas, at least not that I can tell. 

\+ Pro:

According to all the CNBC I watched last year, ""markets look ahead by 6 months"". I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, then the stock price won't wait to catch up to production outputs. Additionally, CNBC has never once mentioned this company and their go-to response whenever anything rare earth related comes up is MP. That's fine with me seeing as I own lots of MP, but it just seems totally inaccurate and lazy to me. 

\- Con:

The US government [currently supports Lynas](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/us-dod-rare-earth-metals-contract-lynas-china-hondo-texas/). Interestingly, and I don't know if this is good or bad, MP and UUUU are the only rare earth related stocks tradeable on the NYSE. If Lynas were on the NYSE, I might feel slightly differently about all this. Of course, they are not a uranium producer. With Energy Fuels' new supply chain, if I were the US government, I'd take a hard look at UUUU's rare earth production. 

\+ Pro:

the company has zero debt. 

\- Con:

They just announced a 300mm mixed shelf, which to the best of my understanding could be very dilutive to shareholders (ie not good for the stock price), but is also a sign that they are planning major investments. Open to being educated on the effects of shelf offerings.

\+ Pro:

I've talked a lot about rare earths, which they are just entering into. Let's get back to uranium. Why are people so bullish on uranium? The market cap of the top 50 uranium companies in the world recently hit a high of $1.3T. This reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) from last year called the start of the bull market for uranium. Why?

To the best of my understanding, it comes down to tightening supply and demand. While there have been short term gyrations due to the Covid closing some mining facilities, which lowered supply, which then made the spot price more expensive, the bigger picture of the uranium (as a commodity) supercycle has to do with electrification. The world's energy needs have already increased massively, and with EVs set to the be the standard car of choice as the 2020s progress, along with population growth, the increased need for electricity will need to be met somehow. While existing sources could work, Elon Musk noted in a recent interview that: 

&gt;“electricity demand will likely double over the next two decades as a result of the update of electric vehicles.”[\[3\]](https://urnmetf.com/posts/electric-vehicles-drive-demand-for-nuclear-uranium#_edn3)   This does not take into account increased demand that may result from other sources such as increased population, growing reliance on digital services, etc.

Mr. Musk went on to note that sourcing the energy necessary to power EVs has the potential to become the biggest obstacle over the next two decades.

To meet this demand, Musk added that “to do this, we have to increase the capacities of wind, solar, and nuclear power plants.”  However, given that the wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine, he noted that nuclear power might be necessary to meet tomorrow’s need for electricity.

There is also a carbon-free/clean power component to this (more on this below). In short, the world's energy needs will rocket, and to meet it, uranium might be the fuel. 

\- Con: 

The uranium spot price has declined for a couple months after jumping last year. Is this a downward trend or just a breather? Is it just hype that people are talking about uranium if the spot price (and long term price) are trending lower? You'll have to decide this part for yourself. A [chart is here](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price), from Cameco, a huge uranium miner in the US. 

\+ Pro:

Celebrity hype? Well I doubt we'll ever get Mia Khalifa, but, Bill Gates is no scrub either. See here for his [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/bill-gates-nuclear-power-will-absolutely-be-politically-acceptable.html) on CNBC recently. 

Yes I would prefer Roaring Kitty, but Michael Burry (The Big Short) will have to do for now. Check out his [updated twitter cover pic](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en) as of a couple weeks ago. 

&gt;Nuclear power will ‘absolutely’ be politically acceptable again — it’s safer than oil, coal, natural gas - Bill Gates, 2021 

\+ Pro:

UUUU is also a major producer of [Vanadium](https://www.energyfuels.com/vanadium-production), important for EV batteries, aerospace, renewable energy systems. They've upgraded their vanadium producing capabilities, yada yada yada, etc, etc. The point is, this is another tailwind they're taking advantage of. 

\+ Pro:

The stock is cheap. It's testing $6. The options are cheap too, though I don't know anything about gamma squeezing and all that. To be clear though, I wouldn't be surprised to see some pullback from here either, so my buy targets are all the way through the low $5's. 

\+ Pro: 

Through a very rough February, UUUU mostly held its ground. The chart looks good. Wedge breakout. See here:

\+ Pro:

And, take a look at this [very interesting tweet](https://twitter.com/ziontree/status/1366013984307044356). This appears to be someone that was very much anti-nuclear a long time ago (sorry, I think it's pronounced ""nucular"". Et tu Bush? This is really 2006 all over again) and is now pro-nuclear. I think this has some interesting implications. If the climate change crowd sees nuclear as a key part of reversing extreme climate trends and creating a healthy planet, that would mark a huge shift. The Biden administration energy secretary has also expressed openness to nuclear. This has the potential to be bipartisan, and the only bipartisan thing I've seen recently was both AOC and Cruz trashing Robinhood for blocking everyone's trading. Wouldn't it be something if the thing that got nuclear power popular again, as it is carbon-free, was climate change? Something about strange bedfellows... 

For more DD, you can see the UUUU investor presentation [here](https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ircnw_energyfuels/721/2020-02%20Corp%20Presentation%20%28FINAL%29-Edit.pdf). With multiple tailwinds in uranium, vanadium, and rare earths, this is a long-term hold. For more community, you can see r/UraniumSqueeze.

71,lwbxy9,"I'm sure that many of you are in the same situation as me: My smooth brain and ADHD medicine force me to constantly refresh the DD page when I could be masturbating to cuck porn. To help my fellow smooth brainers with this, I have made a compilation of GME DD with links, enjoy:

**First post:** Here’s a link to the first DD that I did on GME, I still stand by everything I said in that. This covers prevois price action, volume, brokerages, etc: 

**ETFs:** Hedge funds are massively shorting ETFs that contain GME or have a bearish sentiment in order to hide their positions, drive down the price, delay the squeeze, and make interest in GME decrease. Here are the links: 

**Borrow Rate:** Use this link from iborrowdesk to see that the available short shares of GME are behaving similarly to last time and that the borrow rate is hiking. Similar data can be found on fintel, but this site gives you more data: 

Short interest: As I said, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an accurate short interest number because the numbers are probably not being accurately reported, naked shorts, and ETFs leading to indirect shorting. Here are a bunch of posts on all that shit: 

**Price action:** GME fractal pattern is repeating itself, which suggests that HFs keep trying to make it go down but it is resisting at every turn and is continuing to be bullish 

**Volume:** Couldn’t find the link to this but I saw a post comparing the short float and volume of the first squeeze to now and it’s very similar. If anyone has the link please comment because it’s almost identical. My original post and many other posts linked here also have information on volume similarities.

**Uncle Bruce:** He's a boomer who makes YouTube videos but is actually a smooth brain warrior with excellent insights about how some HFs are probably playing this long, which will only increase the price:

**VIX:** GME price spikes seem to be correlated with more volatility in the market as the VIX usually spikes and SPX drops precipitously (note that if you think buying calls on the VIX is a good idea because of this, I would think twice because this squeeze will likely take longer and theta decay will eat your ass on VIX calls in the process): 

[u/HeyItsPixeL](https://new.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/)\*\*:\*\* If you click on any of these links, click on this one. This is by far the best DD that I’ve ever seen on WSB. In short, he talks about the likelihood of a gamma/short squeeze all pointing to a specific date (March 19) because of naked shorts and provides a MASSIVE amount of data for it: 

**Catalysts and personal notes:** I echo everything that [u/heyitspixel](https://new.reddit.com/u/heyitspixel/) said in the above link. I also want to emphasize other potential catalysts such as earnings on March 26, possible acquisitions, AMC earnings tonight, Ryan Cohen tweets, DFV’s 500 april ITM calls, and Elon/Chamath/other celebrities tweeting about more interest in the stock. I cannot stress enough that I think this squeeze will take longer than the last one but will be bigger especially if us smooth brains continue to hold and buy. Right now, it seems that the HFs are building an extremely steep house of cards because of naked shorts that will eventually come tumbling down in an even bigger way than last time. They are trying to delay the squeeze so that people get bored and sell but all that it’s doing is building up the gas for the inevitable squeeze. I want to emphasize further than brokerages WILL be the end of this like they were last time, but I believe that because they have more liquidity and don’t want another media nightmare like last time, that they will let this last much longer. I also want to emphasize that their actions only have power if people actually do sell when they restrict buying. Finally, I want to emphasize heyitspixels sentiment that many other institutions seem to be long on this and want to profit from the squeeze as well, which only helps us. Right now, it seems like it’s WSB + some institution(s) v. HFs (Melvin, citadel, etc). Great posts about catalysts and future action: 

**Finally, I want to address 2 common arguments that I keep seeing:**

1. “the squeeze is already squoze, this information is public, it’s not gonna happen again” – to that I say, take a look at any post before the January squeeze and you will see the exact same shit. Based on the information I’ve provided above, it’s hard to deny that another squeeze is not imminent, but if you wanna miss out, your brain is smoother than mine.
2. “No way hedge funds will let this happen again, they learned from last time” – to which I say, 2007 has entered the chat. If you really think that these guys learn from massive mistakes, your brain is smoother than silk. Most of these fuckers who are short are shorting out of rage and spite, which is making them act illogical. The fact that there is still AT LEAST 60% short interest on this after that massive squeeze shows that most of them didn’t cover and want to dig this thing into the ground. Don’t be naïve.

**Conclusion:** (This is from my first post). Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be and the date of March 19. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.

For those of you interested, my wife’s boyfriend has promised to let me go to the park with him WITHOUT MY LEASH ON if the stock goes above 1k. He already said that I can sleep in the garage instead of under the deck if it hits 800, so he has even more riding on this than the hedge funds.

76,lwbyjb,"So you heard the talk about rockets.

So you heard the talk about fueling.

So you heard about the moon.

Let me tell you something rather simple, but very intelligentelly. I read things about ""the longer the shorts are shorting, the higher it will squeeze"". I processed this in my dual-core processor called my brain and had a eureka moment.

A rocket is something that can take you to space, but in order the reacher higher altitudes you need more fuel. The only way you can carry more fuel is by using a bigger rocket. This is exactly what is happening at the moment. Whenever GME is trading sideways or dipping (what is known as 'fueling up'), more retardonauts are granted access to the rocket ship, each one of them bringing resources that are added to the rocket. As time passes and more astrotards enter the ship, the ship grows bigger through all the resources being pumped into it. 

Here is a mathematical (yes I know I blow my own mind at times too) equation:

(Sideways movement + dips) x (astrotards ^2) = distance.

This basically means the longer we are fueling up, the bigger the rocket becomes, the more fuel it carries, which ultimately results in a longer distance spaceflight. The moon is merely a checkpoint by then.

TL;DR (or can't read): more 🦍 and longer ⛽ means further 🚀 and more 🪐 visited.

83,lwbz9q,"I work for DoorDash, it pays my rent but I can tell they are desperate for a profit. Where I live in upstate New York, demand is 'very high' almost all the time however I don't know if that's from a lack of workers or a large amount of orders. Either way, without a customer tips the company probably can't pay workers a reasonable amount. I also order it on rare occasion when there's a discount. 

We all know they are slowly bleeding cash but I'd like to put in perspective how fragile their revenue is even when its at a loss. Their prices are inflated for almost all restaurants. If you order pickup through the DDash app its like 10%ish more expensive than just ordering on the restaurant's website. For a real bad example this greek place I like costs 11.99 for beef shawarma and its 13.99 on the DDash app. This is either because DDash is raising the prices on their app or the restaurant has to charge more to compensate for the commission paid to DDash that comes along with getting your restaurant on the app. I dont know what percentage or how much it is per restaurant but I know there is either a flat rate or a monthly rate. I couldn't be bothered to google it but if most restaurants pay a flat rate, this revenue will slow down eventually as more stores get on the app, or if its mostly monthly it will be long term revenue. They also collect money from subscriptions, if the customer pays 9.99 a month they can get unlimited no-delivery-fee-orders as long as that order is for over $12. This is deceiving for this reason: **They charge an additional 15% 'service fee' at checkout and you miss it because its added to the sales tax.** My assumption is this: two types of customers: single persons and families/large orders. If you ordering a lot of food, that 15% earns DDash quite a bit. If you are a single person ordering, a $12 amount is awkward to reach, a chipotle type restaurant is just under at $10 and like half of applebee's/chili's entrees are just under $12 therefore you're spending more like 15-20 to reach the point where you're ""saving money"". In short, people on the pass need to get 4-5 deliveries to be ""saving money"". If you are not on the battle pass it makes zero sense. As a customer, say you want chipotle, $10.15 for the meal (steak bowl) $0.89 sales tax (NY) $1.52 service fee $3 delivery fee and $3 tip (if you want your shit to be delivered on time) = **$18.56.** If you compare this to buying on the app $8.65, tax is $0.76, say you are a fuckin long way but u really want that burrito 10 miles at the average of 25mpg and a cost of $3.00 a gallon is $2.40, but you left work and are late coming back on your lunch break by 10mins bc you drive 30mph so it took you 40mins and at an average US wage of $20, you lost $3.33 which is **$15.14** so even in this stupid scenario DDash will never be worth the cost. Unless you have an injury, sickness, disability, are holding a special occasion or have ""fuckyou income""... you are not paying for this delivery service.

Now their expenses are essentially just paying drivers and running the app. Drivers can accept and decline orders. At certain hours where demand is high or there are few workers, drivers get a bonus typically $1-3 per order. Last summer there could've been a whopping $3-7 bonus like once a week which doesn't happen anymore. I assume that was because the company was doing great from covid. Most 'good' orders are $7-9 total to the driver, that is probably the delivery fee + tip. Anyone who doesn't tip usually has their order sit for a long ass time because no one is going to get paid $3.00 to bring your food 6+ miles. I don't know where bonus pay comes from though, delivery fees don't change. Since delivery fees cancel out, you can assume they make money from restaurants and the ""15% fee"" so all the bonuses must wipe out a portion of that. A small amount is paid in referrals which is alright at best $1000 to you if a friend does 280 deliveries in 60 days which amounts to like 16hrs a week but no one with a job is gonna commit to that. Another small amount is rewards for dedicated dashers, its a huge lie, this month its 550 deliveries for an extra $225 that's 68hrs a week if 1 delivery = 1/2hour. Even if we account for double orders and some fast ones that may or may not be worth our time, you have to be mentally insane to work 8-9hrs a day for 30 days straight while getting some dogshit orders along the way, sometimes of the day you might not get orders so add that on.

**BULL CASE (SORTA):** I will be buying some future puts here soon when I save the money but it would still be nice to see them succeed. The only long term bull case is that they completely squash all their competition. This industry's margins are too small for more than one company. DoorDash would need to be making moves now to completely undercut GrubHub, and Uber. Them buying Caviar was good but their only options seem to be: blood let themselves on cash, make delivery's free, advertise out the ass and control so much market share their competitors die, or acquire them somehow (virtually impossible). They cannot be competing and making money at the same time (obviously). Maybe Instacart and DDash can coexist since they don't directly compete. Instacart is positioned well in grocery delivery, if you ignore walmart they stand basically alone. They're valued at $7.8B so if DDash could somehow acquire them it would help a lot. Radical change has to happen in this company and if someone else could do the DD that proves the CEO has balls to buttfuck the competition have at it. The way they are going is a slow death even though the service they provide is pretty sick. Sitting on my ass I can make food appear, revolutionary idea, poor business model.

Also what index funds should I invest in and with which trading service? Are there dividend paying index funds and also how many index funds should I invest in? Is it better to start with index funds or etf's?
