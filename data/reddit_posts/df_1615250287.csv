17,m0umfm,"Hey guys, I wanted to just share with you guys how much of an idiot I am and I'm hoping it will be kind of a vent for my frustration. For a bit of context I'm 20 years old and going to University.

So I got in to the GME stock very late. I had seen a lot of memes about it and thought it would be quick cash, which I needed. I bought in at around 240 dollars on the way up to the second spike. I didn't know much about it at the time. I sold the few stocks I had at the time and put in 9k of my cash. It was almost everything I had. 

In the beginning it was going great, but very soon I started seeing red. A lot of red, but I still held on to it. I tried to tell myself that it would go up again, I just needed to hold until the short squeeze. As the days went on I started to get more and more scared when all that I saw was red, most of my money disappearing. 

When it got to about 40 dollars I just couldn't take it anymore. I thought it would just keep going down until it hit the bottom, so I sold everything to cut my losses. I was very frustrated. I promised myself to never invest in anything highly speculative again. 

Now that the stock is going up again, I am even more frustrated. At the time I'm writing this post it is up again to 194. If I had only held a little longer. I am incredibly tempted to buy into it again to recoup some of my losses, but I promised myself to never do it.  But man that ""what if"" feeling is hard to ignore.

26,m0uohz,"Background of company: An insurtech company dealing with car insurance. Different from all other  insurance companies in the space because they do insurance based on how much you drive. So people that drive less than 12,000 miles a year would save money using this. Great for high populated areas such as New York and San Fran. 

They are currently only running in 8 states so a huge growth opportunity when they expand. They have been beaten down a lot with this sell off and are below SPAC offering. 

Revenue and Competition: 
Their market cap is getting close to 1 billion with over 100 mill in revenue. Compare it to their competitor Lemonade which does different types of insurance they have comparable  revenue and growth but LMND market cap is 5 times that of Metro but Metro has more room to grow cause of the expansion of their market which is 42 more states and possibly out of the country. 

They also have a deal with Ford on new vehicles that they signed last year in December to help get their name out their and their tech is actually pretty good. 

They are also a SaaS company that can sell their tech to other insurance companies to use with the basis of tracking miles and calculating your insurance that way. 

They are beat down just like their competitors LMND and Root but are way undervalued compared to them with way more growth opportunities and are different than any other insurance company.",Metromile (MILE) great value play at this point,1.0,1615250697,Either_Loan_6516

I bought 50 shares at $23.90 and am already up to today’s close of 27.56. A year ago it was at $130 and in 2018 it was stonktacular at $434. 

I feel like the energy sector is on a rebound, particularly after the pain of watching gas in my town starting to deeply climb.

If you haven't seen the demo for either OS, check it out here!

Foundry is going to change the foundation of the typical supply chain with seamless data integration for live predictive models and active problem solving. With AWS, AMZN, offering an ERP suite with PLTR tech allows companies to save money instantly by integrating data to allow AI to find ways to be more profitable. BP saved 50 million within two weeks of using Foundry.

Gotham has been a staple for the U.S. military for active decision making and ""Gotham is an AI-ready platform that improves and accelerates decisions for operators at every echelon and in every domain — land, sea, air, space, and cyber.""

Any company that has massive amounts of data will turn to use PLTR services and continue to expand the commercial growth of the company. One of the biggest gripes of PLTR was its overreliance of revenue in the government sector. We are at a pivotal time where the company will continue to add contracts and get closer to profitability. Once we were completely out of the pandemic, companies will want to free up more capital to supplement the growth of the overall market i.e. higher operations costs. If you are discouraged, I would watch these demos. It will excite you.
