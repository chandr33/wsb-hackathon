Now that Wall Street recognized NOK as #1 company to benefit from 5G, the stock will have an exponential growth. Remember we’re still in the early stages of a decade-long 5G boom, which we’re on track to take off this summer and begin to see 5G services offered. It is predicted that shipments for 5G devices in 2021 will exceed 500 million. And that’s when 5G will start to get really exciting and 5G networks will be live in hundreds of cities around the world. We’ll see applications like the Internet of Things… robotic surgery… holographic telepresence… and self-driving cars.

16,m2mxtj,"Right now the Biden administration is passing the latest stimulus package, but their next focus is on the green new deal.

As of 2019, [nuclear](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php#:~:text=For%20cost%20and%20technical%20reasons,electricity%20generation%20was%20about%2020%25.)
 accounts for 20% of electricity generated in the US. This number is set to rise with bi-partisan support by both [Republican and Democratic](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/nuclear-energy) senators for nuclear power.

With the current cyclical shift from tech stocks to value based companies such as energy and mining, Nuclear is set to take off as negotiations will undoubtedly drive hype around this industry. 

Similiar to the psychedelics/weed hype bubble, we will most likely see a small 400% to 500% gain on this stock (4 or 5 usd) in the short term (next two months) before it crashes to around 3 USD. 

This cycle will then kick off again in a year from now as nuclear infrastructure is built and demand increases.

By 2025 when demand for nuclear materials has outpaced supply, it is very likely that we could see the price of DNN sitting around $28 to $35 USD a share.

Right now, DNN itself does not actually mine Uranium yet (paused due to Covid) - they are in the exploratory phases (which as of March 2021 are pending their Environmental Clearance for construction).

[Their findings show](https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-reports-a-year-of-significant-project-and-122727/) that their land located in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan holds around 132.1 Million Pounds of Triuranium octoxide. Their holdings in Pheonix hold roughly 108 million pounds of Triuranium octoxide (both of which can be mined over 14 years). These estimates are also on the lowest end at concentrations of 3.3% - the highest of which being 7.7% which would add another 60 million and 54 million pounds respectively (which I do not account for in my profit calculations below).

At current market prices these retail for $25 a pound. Their operating costs for staging, mining, and selling this Uranium is roughly $3.33/lb (including the 300 million for setting up these mines in both locations).

At current market demand, they would be making $16.2 Billion in PROFIT over 14 years (roughly 1.16 Billion per year).

This is assuming that the U.S., China, Canada or any other country that is moving towards renewable energies does not increase their nuclear fleet, which could potentially raise the price higher on this non-renewable.

With staging occuring in 2021, the two mines are expected to be operational and running by 2024, a year before any new power plants will be completed if passed by the Biden administration. 

Basically at worst they will be making 1.16 Billion in profit per year from 2024 to 2036. Given that they have around 690,000,000 shares outstanding, their earnings per share will be about 1.7 by 2025 a huge increase from their current -0.0260.

They are currently debt free and hold $85 million in cash.

Interesting to note that their chief engineer (their Vice President of Operations) David Bronhurst, served as a a lead Subject Matter Liason for 8 years in the International Atomic Energy Agency. He also has over 35 years in Uranium mining experience.

In short DNN, is a good long-term buy that is forcasted to appreciate over 1,000% in the next 2-3 years and could rise as much as 30,000% over the next 10-years.

35,m2n1ul,"First of all I have to congratulate to all apes that hold this attractive stock with their diamond hands, and shoutout to everyone who even bought the rediculous dip that we all witnessed yesterday (10th).  
So I want to explain what HFT is and how the ultra rich use it.   
Some of you might be too young to witness and some heard of these mega bubbles like the ""dotcom bubble"" 2000 and the ""real estate bubble"" 2007-08.   
You might have heard about the movies of Wall Street, Margin Call or Boiler Room that are based on the events that happened before.

Lets get this straight. Market Manipulation has always been a part of the stockmarket. Such as insider buying or selling with large orders.(For that you could as a normal trader find still a way to be profitable) but with internet and technology that just got better and better over time, the softwares with High Frequency Computer Trading/Algorithm have changed this market manipulation that we see today.   
So what is this software?  
Such software is capable of doing trades in milliseconds. They are used to drive stocks up rediculously high or down. It gives the people that are watching this an optical illusion that a stock is being bought with momentum or sold with force. So good luck being a technical trader.

By selling stocks as soon as they buy them, the HFT is manipulating price differences.  
Faster trades = more money  
In HFT it doesnt matter how much money is moving in each direction per trade, its the amount of trades the program can make in a split second thats important.

So if you can make like 10.000 trades every second and arbitrage 0.0001 cents per trade, thats 1$ every second.  60$ every minute and 3600$ every hour.  


And then there is fake news. If someone decides to create panic, they simply make some news. Post it. ""Ape stuck in Bananaprocessing machine, production halted"". And as soon as this is posted, the stock of your BananaCompany that you have invested in, has dropped before you could even react onto it.

And who loses money? The normal investors. Mostly retailers. So if anyone talks that a retailer is able to manipulate a market while these big boys have 70-80% power over it, thats fake news.

We can prolly give it momentum, but that's all. 

But the real battle is between the bigboys themselves. Because each one of them has such a machine, and it must be better than the other, in order to win.   
So what these programs are designed to do apart from making trades in milliseconds, they also FAKE in milliseconds.  The Trade orders are sent  to throw a kink into competing programs. Many trades are just made to flood the market and trick other computers+investors into thinking that a trend may be occurring in a particular stock, when no trend really exists.

So these programs are made to read feeds and analyze data, but they cant varify wether this data is true or not. So wether the ape stuck in bananamachine and the production is halted news is true or not, the stock will fall because the bot reads it. The same way when you play an online game, the program cannot see and decide wether you are sabotaging the game or you are just bad af. But if you for example write some words, especially negative, they immediatly strike you with a ban.

How do we know we are in a bubble? When you make cash easy. And the bubble grows exponentially higher when these bots are included aswell. And why will the stockmarket crash? Because of easy money. 

So some should consider after this bubble bursts, that trading might not be the same again. Then we talk about a bearish market. And as normal  trader it is impossible to beat the market. If you wanna invest, invest in a company that you believe in a longterm growth. GME will be one of a kind thing.

89,m2nebm,"Today I noticed an article from [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-stock-on-a-roller-coaster-once-again-as-short-interest-drops-193227331.html) stating that short interest has decreased. They list S3 Partners as a source for this [image](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MkVXMG96ehZmCECEATNvvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/7e513340-81d5-11eb-bb7b-a10ddb84ae91). 

S3 Partners is a FinTech company who measure short interest. Seems all solid until I found the twitter of S3 partners retweeting a tweet that GME is one of the most 'squeezable' stocks at this moment. The tweet was posted 21 hours ago, so that could still mean it has decreased afterwards. 

I stumbled on the account of Ihor Dusaniwsky, Managing Director of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners. I cannot confirm at this moment if this is his real twitter account, but it seems to be legit. 10 hours ago, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1369795438304501760): ""$GME is still in a moderate short squeeze as shorts continue to slowly close their positions, I still see it as a short sqeeuze candidate""

Now these two things seem to contradict each other, or am I reading this wrong? Did short interest decrease but not enough to not have a short squeeze happen?

My understanding of how shorting works is the following: 

Step 1: Monkey Borrow Banana   
Step 2: Monkey Sell Banana   
Step 3: Monkey Buy Banana for less than monkey sold  
Step 4: Monkey gains profit, can now buy crayons for poor Apes.   


The SSR **(Short Sale Restriction)** comes into play when a stock ends or drops more than 10% in a given day (not too sure about that) - but what I do know, is that the SSR says **you can only short a stock on an uptick.**   


But how does that actually translate into our process of shorting a stock as I described Step 1-4 ?  
Does it mean you can't borrow stocks on an uptick?   
Or how does it actually prevent shorting on upticks? 

If the implication of the SSR is that you can only borrow stocks on a downtick, then you could just borrow as many stocks as you want on the downtick and **wait**, as you have 3 days to sell them after they are being borrowed **- so once you have a nice stock of borrowed stocks, you can sell them all** and even though there is a SSR it doesn't really affect anything? 

I would love if someone could explain what it means in detail, I am unable to find any satisfying answers on google.
