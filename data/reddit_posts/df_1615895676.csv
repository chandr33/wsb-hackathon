12,m67evi,"We've had our ups and downs this year with GME but the biggest thing that has moved the price has been catalysts. Honestly, I appreciate all the DD and TA but this is such a complicated investing/trading environment with ambiguity and deception that we probably won't fully know what's what until after it's all over.   


So why do I hold? Because despite the HFs' 5-20% price wars that we are collateral damage in, it is the news catalysts that work the price up the ladder and put more pressure on those short and market makers to delta hedge in support of gamma and short squeezes. With catalysts, we're just along for the ride. Jesus take the wheel! 🚀 🚀 🚀 

That said, GME may go up, it may go down, but one thing I would say is more than likely is some piece of good news or announcement that can act as a spark. Look at when Elon tweeted, DFV doubled down, RC tweeting. That is what pushes it up. I mean a fucking ice cream cone acted as rocket fuel. Waiting can be painful, but it's so easy a retarded ape can do it. 🦍 🍌 

I'm comfortable with the bet that there is enough chance of another catalyst to outweigh the downside. And gains that often follow these catalysts are big enough to get the attention of your wife's boyfriend. 

What is the probabilistic expected outcome? That's for everyone else to figure out for themselves. Nobody can predict this objectively. Sure there are things on the horizon (stimmays, quad witching), but I'm no damn Nostradamus at predicting how those exactly will impact GME. I'll play my subjective odds because that's all I really can do. 

For me, I look at it as a \~70% likelihood of another catalyst soon with gains of more than double if it does happen. So, 0.7 \* 2x is 1.3x. That 30% surge might get some momentum going! 

At this point, as long as you're not in for more than you can stand to lose, strap in and enjoy the ride. 

How would you feel if you were chasing other gains if this dropped?

38,m67k53,"There is potential for a short-squeeze emerging in a stock a that I have been  following for over a year now and I feel like it just fits this crowd  and theme so well that I couldnt resist sharing.

Stock is Scorpio Tankers $STNG. It  has been all over the place for the last year, but is finally catching  its bid due to a real fundamental shift in the market for clean product  tankers and it has a pretty sizable short interest that will need to be  covered over the next week....

For  some brief background: Scorpio owns a bunch of super huge ships (like  the size of the eiffel tower and shit) that only transport clean refined  products (gasoline, diesel, etc) and other specialty oils and chemicals  (like palm oil, old bacon grease for bio-diesel, etc). Now, since it  got cold AF up in TX a few weeks back, US refineries have been offline  and we have been importing a bunch of gasoline, diesel, etc from Europe  (if you noticed how expensive gas is everywhere... there ya go). The  catch? The damage to refineries from busted pipes and downed power  sources was WAY WORSE than anyone expected and instead of a bump in the  road, we have a situation that is actually worse then Katrina in terms  of refined product availability. The result? We are puling a shit-ton of  fuel from Europe (where they were drowning in it) to the point that  they have now drained the Middle East, who is now draining Asia.  Needless to say... its crazy. Not headline news because... you know, its  the news, but if you start digging through reliable energy resources,  you can see how bad the situation really is (just a note, they still  havent got the refineries back online). To make the situation a bit  worse, the world is opening up faster than anyone expected and we are  using a shit load of refined products (everything from gasoline to  plastic) and its creating massive strain on the refining sector.

Speaking  of the refining sector, lets pause there for a sec. Due to how bad the  decline in demand for refined products was last year, OECD countries  decided to convert \~4Mbpd of refining capacity into import terminals  because it was cheaper to ship finished gasoline and diesel into most  countries than to bother with importing crude and refining it at home.  Australia was probably the best example, but it happened across the  globe in Europe, US, Japan, etc.

The  result? Everyone is now scrambling to try to import gasoline, diesel,  heating oil, and other refined products all over the world. Similar to  how these industries completely kill themselves for a decade by everyone  across the globe building capacity at the same time and oversupplying  the market; COVID caused this to happen in reverse! So, while the entire  refining landscape shifts over the next few years/decades, the  incredibly lucky winners will be the guys that happen to own the ships  that transport refined products all over the world. Enter Tankers.

Now  not all tankers are equal. First, there are crude tankers and product  tankers. As their name suggests, crude tankers carry crude oil and  product tankers carry refined products. They never cross paths, they are  completely their own markets. Ignoring the more complicated issue of  what will happen with crude tankers, lets take the more obvious play of  product tankers. With the current market going crazy due to the global  inventory imbalances due to the US refinery issues from the TX freeze,  product tankers are getting bid up as traders and oil majors are  desperate to get gasoline, jet, diesel, etc from Asia to the Western  Hemisphere... rates are surging and wont stop anytime soon. Add in the  rolling conversions of refinery capacity to import terminals and  biofhuel mixing operaitons, and you have a set-up that is just so wall  timed and placed for this specific sector, it feels honestly dirty to be  benefiting from the terrible shit that the folks in TX had to endure  with the freeze.

Finally for the  supply side. Product tanker owners - and tanker owners in general - have  stopped ordering new vessels over the past 5 years for a few reasons:  1) rates have sucked and it doesnt make sense, 2) banks have been burned  a few too many times and financing has dried up, 3) their regulator  (IMO) has promised a set of carbon-related regulations that will drive  the decision for the next-gen of propusion technology, but they havent  delivered the regs and the propulsion technology is changing just about  daily so no one is ordering, and 4) the shipyards got crushed in COVID  and consolidated operations, followed by an insane rate boom in dry buly  and containers that subsequently took up shipyard capacity for the  forseeable future, you couldn't add a meaningful amount of capacity to  the product tanker market even if you cleared hurdles 1-3 due to  capacity. A small nuance: product tankers differ from crude tankers  primarily due tot he coating on their tanks that protects the more  volatile refined products from degradation during transport (pretty  important if you consider things like jet fuel); now those coatings  deteriorate over time and are deemed unreliable at \~15yrs. So whether or  not an owner decides to ""scrap"" his ship, nobody is gonna give him/her  any business for the traditional/premium product trade. A bit of  history: the product tanker trade really emerged in the late 1990s and  early 2000s, with a huge building boom taking place in that period as we  as a society began to trade refined products more heavily and  understand the importance of quality control in a more scientific  manner. Now, in 2020, we are seeing a huge portion of the existing fleet  ""age-out"".

Very long story short; The world will need a lot more product tankers in the near-term, and today, they just aren't there.

Now, Finally, why this is important in the context of a short squeeze in the near future.

The  largest operator of product tankers in the world is Scorpio Tankers  (NYSD: STNG). They have proven themselves strong operators and also have  (to a meaningful extent) created a consolidated position the LR2  segment where they are the largest single owner and also manage a huge  fleet of other owners' ships in what is called a pool. LR2s are the  largest product tankers, and given the market dynamics I described  above, they are in very high demand. Rates are rising quickly and dont  seem to have a good reason to stop. To make matters a bit more  interesting, Scorpio has a rather large debt load, making it the target  of short sellers. It is currently the most shorted tanker stock despite  having the youngest fleet with deepest scrubber penetration (discussed  below). After months of being pounded in 2020, the stock is finally  ripping upwards, and with the earnings potential of its fleet it should  easily double or triple on sheer fundamentals. Now, enter a few fun  freebees that make this fun: a related party to the Company, Scorpio  Services Holdings (or something), which is owned by management is  purchasing millions of dollars of stock roughly every 6 wks, along with  Scorpio's President, Robert Bugnee, who along with personal stock  purchases has purchased millions of dollars worth of out of the money  call options expiring from here to 2023. To put it lightly, they have  backed up the truck. The Board has also approved a $250M share buyback  program (market cap is \~$1B) and at Bugbees prior shipping venture he  bought back \~30% of all outstanding stock before selling the company at  the market peak for an absurd return to shareholders.

My final points on the company are on its fleet:

1. Scorpio  has the largest fleet of Long-Range (LR) vessels in the world: With the  closure of OECD refineries and global refining capacity shifting to  China, India, and the Middle East, voyage distances will increase  significantly making demand for LRs even stronger.
2. Scorpio  has the youngest fleet (Period): With the importance of ESG and  customers need to track carbon output, combined with EEXI regulations  (google) from IMO and the EUs decision to add shipping into the carbon  cap-and-trade market, yonger/ECO tonnage will dominate the tanker market  going forward. Over the past months, large charterers such as Trafigura  have instituted CO2 tracking and reporting policies that create a  pricing premium for ECO vessels like Scorpios. Also, Scorpio has already  begun to see revenues from generating carbon credits during Q4'20 due  to its ECO fleet; if Tesla has taught us anything: those can be  valuable.
3. Scrubbers:  Scorpio has been the most aggressive product tanker owner in installing  (expensive) exhaust scrubbers to reduce SOx emissions. This also allows  them to burn traditional bunker fuels rather than the new ""Very Low  Sulfer Fuel Oil"" or VLSFO, which has caused its competitors incredible  headaches. 1) VLSFO is a new fuel and has not been delivered in with  consistent make-ups (they started experimenting with mixing jet fuel  into the blend when nobody was flying) which has caused extensive and  severe mechanical issues and engine failures. Additionally, the pricing  difference between VLSFO and the fuel Scorpio is able to use in  combination with its scrubbers has been rapidly increasing and expected  to remain elevated, providing a SIGNIFICANT cost advantage to Scorpio.
4. Management  has used a lot of debt to build and support this incredible fleet, and  they have managed their balance sheet about as well as could be dreamed.  They have been able to maintain strong liquidity and continue to  refinance/roll their secured debt and push out maturities. They also  have avoided any real restrictive covenants, allowing them to return  cash to shareholders despite what seems like a hefty debt load. Note,  this is part of investing in cyclical industrial businesses... they  require capital, but when they hit the cycle right the cash flows are  unbelievable.
5. Finally,  the short squeeze. Scorpio has been heavily shorted for over a year due  to its debt load and a general pessimistic view on global oil  consumption (recall that even if consumption remained depressed,  refinery closures would create significant demand for product tankers  beyond current capacity). The market has finally turned - aided by the  freeze in TX - and the shorts have begun to cover, but there remains  over 2 days of volume sold short and with the brutal price action over  the past year along with managements large purchases, there could be a  real group of diamond hands that can create a real squeeze next week as  the remaining shorts look to cover.

This is both a trade and an investment. The squeeze could happen over the  next week or two; the signal form the underlying rates market along  with the strong price action will have the shorts looking to exit, its  just a matter of who will be selling (not me)? In the longer term, this  will be a multi-year cycle with multi-bagger potential for those who are  strong enough to just hold..

GME sits in a pool of misdirected funds. The actual up and down on game doesn't matter to the value of the asset shorts and longs alike. For this much shorting to occur they also see it as a valuable asset that they want to tame. The amount of currency being exposed to the stock should not shake anyone.

[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) has gained a lot of popularity for his incredible ROI this year.

Many people wait for his famous ""YOLO UPDATE"" that he posts every now and then.

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

**DFV was just like you and me.**

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

The secret to his success was ... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

Product tanker owners - and tanker owners in general - have  stopped ordering new vessels over the past 5 years for a few reasons:  1) rates have sucked and it doesnt make sense, 2) banks have been burned  a few too many times and financing has dried up, 3) their regulator  has promised a set of carbon-related regulations that will drive  the decision for the next-gen of propusion technology, but they havent  delivered the regs and the propulsion technology is changing just about  daily so no one is ordering, and 4) the shipyards got crushed in COVID  and consolidated operations, followed by an insane rate boom in dry buly  and containers that subsequently took up shipyard capacity for the  forseeable future, you couldn't add a meaningful amount of capacity to  the product tanker market even if you cleared hurdles 1-3 due to  capacity. A small nuance: product tankers differ from crude tankers  primarily due tot he coating on their tanks that protects the more  volatile refined products from degradation during transport (pretty  important if you consider things like jet fuel); now those coatings  deteriorate over time and are deemed unreliable at \~15yrs. So whether or  not an owner decides to ""scrap"" his ship, nobody is gonna give him/her  any business for the traditional/premium product trade. A bit of  history: the product tanker trade really emerged in the late 1990s and  early 2000s, with a huge building boom taking place in that period as we  as a society began to trade refined products more heavily and  understand the importance of quality control in a more scientific  manner. Now, in 2020, we are seeing a huge portion of the existing fleet  ""age-out"".

Very long story short; The world will need a lot more product tankers in the near-term, and today, they just aren't there.

Now, Finally, why this is important in the context of a short squeeze in the near future.

The  largest operator of product tankers in the world is Scorpio Tankers  (NYSD: STNG). They have proven themselves strong operators and also have  (to a meaningful extent) created a consolidated position the LR2  segment where they are the largest single owner and also manage a huge  fleet of other owners' ships in what is called a pool. LR2s are the  largest product tankers, and given the market dynamics I described  above, they are in very high demand. Rates are rising quickly and dont  seem to have a good reason to stop. To make matters a bit more  interesting, Scorpio has a rather large debt load, making it the target  of short sellers. It is currently the most shorted tanker stock despite  having the youngest fleet with deepest scrubber penetration (discussed  below). After months of being pounded in 2020, the stock is finally  ripping upwards, and with the earnings potential of its fleet it should  easily double or triple on sheer fundamentals. Now, enter a few fun  freebees that make this fun: a related party to the Company, Scorpio  Services Holdings (or something), which is owned by management is  purchasing millions of dollars of stock roughly every 6 wks, along with  Scorpio's President, Robert Bugnee, who along with personal stock  purchases has purchased millions of dollars worth of out of the money  call options expiring from here to 2023. To put it lightly, they have  backed up the truck. The Board has also approved a $250M share buyback  program (market cap is \~$1B) and at Bugbees prior shipping venture he  bought back \~30% of all outstanding stock before selling the company at  the market peak for an absurd return to shareholders.

My final points on the company are on its fleet:

1. Scorpio  has the largest fleet of Long-Range (LR) vessels in the world: With the  closure of OECD refineries and global refining capacity shifting to  China, India, and the Middle East, voyage distances will increase  significantly making demand for LRs even stronger.
2. Scorpio  has the youngest fleet (Period): With the importance of e.s.g. and  customers need to track carbon output, combined with EEXI regulations  (google) from IMO and the EUs decision to add shipping into the carbon  cap-and-trade market, yonger/e.c.o. tonnage will dominate the tanker market  going forward. Over the past months, large charterers such as Trafigura  have instituted CO2 tracking and reporting policies that create a  pricing premium for ECO vessels like Scorpios. Also, Scorpio has already  begun to see revenues from generating carbon credits during Q4'20 due  to its ECO fleet; if Tesla has taught us anything: those can be  valuable.
3. Scrubbers:  Scorpio has been the most aggressive product tanker owner in installing  (expensive) exhaust scrubbers to reduce SOx emissions. This also allows  them to burn traditional bunker fuels rather than the new ""Very Low  Sulfer Fuel Oil"" or V.L.S.F.O., which has caused its competitors incredible  headaches. 1) V.L.S.F.O. is a new fuel and has not been delivered in with  consistent make-ups (they started experimenting with mixing jet fuel  into the blend when nobody was flying) which has caused extensive and  severe mechanical issues and engine failures. Additionally, the pricing  difference between V.L.S.F.O. and the fuel Scorpio is able to use in  combination with its scrubbers has been rapidly increasing and expected  to remain elevated, providing a SIGNIFICANT cost advantage to Scorpio.
4. Management  has used a lot of debt to build and support this incredible fleet, and  they have managed their balance sheet about as well as could be dreamed.  They have been able to maintain strong liquidity and continue to  refinance/roll their secured debt and push out maturities. They also  have avoided any real restrictive covenants, allowing them to return  cash to shareholders despite what seems like a hefty debt load. Note,  this is part of investing in cyclical industrial businesses... they  require capital, but when they hit the cycle right the cash flows are  unbelievable.
5. Finally,  the short squeeze. Scorpio has been heavily shorted for over a year due  to its debt load and a general pessimistic view on global oil  consumption (recall that even if consumption remained depressed,  refinery closures would create significant demand for product tankers  beyond current capacity). The market has finally turned - aided by the  freeze in TX - and the shorts have begun to cover, but there remains  over 2 days of volume sold short and with the brutal price action over  the past year along with managements large purchases, there could be a  real group of diamond hands that can create a real squeeze next week as  the remaining shorts look to cover.

This is both a trade and an investment. The squeeze could happen over the  next week or two; the signal form the underlying rates market along  with the strong price action will have the shorts looking to exit, its  just a matter of who will be selling (not me)? In the longer term, this  will be a multi-year cycle with multi-bagger potential for those who are  strong enough to just hold..

Note: the research for this DD has mostly been made by u/TendiesOnlyPls over at r/TankerGang. I am very convinced by the arguments (and bought some april calls so far but plan on buying more) and have decided (with his permission) to share this with you all here on wsb. As usual, do your own research before you invest money, but imo this seems like a solid bet, and could be a nice hedge for a tech heavy portfolio.
