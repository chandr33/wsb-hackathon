5,lxefe0,"With this possible, please consider the following as a reason to not panic on 10% drop. 

As we have UI’s helping us, if they intentionally do a 10% drop, this is what to expect in retard form.

10% Drop = SSR

SSR = Less Shorting

Less Shorting = Tendie Man Cums

Tendie Man Cums = tendies

Tendies = Hiring DFV as wife’s new boyfriend

Hiring DFV as wife’s new boyfriend = more allowances

More allowances = more shares

More shares = more buy volume

More buy volume  = potential SSR

Potential SSR = 10% drop

10% drop = SSR


Edit : my positions are GME shares at 40 and calls for 03/19. AMC shares at 9 and calls for 03/19. Pltr long and KOSS as a sympathy play for the GME squeeze.",Probable 10%+ Drop in GME at Some Point Tomorrow,0.82,1614839434,RocketMan420-69

31,lxengu,"Just a little over a year ago, in the March/April 2020 dip, SPY was just USD222.

The recent dip needs to be looked at in context, just zoom out to a 1year chart instead of looking at the weekly/1month chart. 

We are still doing very well, all things considered.

93,lxf5v9,"Yep. You read that correctly, no this isn’t a reference to investing in your beloved stock. It’s just a message to all of you and in specific the person that really needs to hear this right now. 

WSB is a toxic community, we pride ourselves in it. It’s kind of like how when your dad says “shut up retard” what he really means is I love you son. (Well maybe he really does mean you’re retarded and wants you to shut up) 

I digress… Anyways, with a community of over 9 million users it would be almost statistically impossible that there **isnt** someone here who has lost a lot of money, has made a huge mistake whether it be from just misunderstanding, or trading on emotions and is really battling with suicidal thoughts. 

I just want to let you know that I and many others are here for you, you can message me anytime my inbox is open. Your life isn’t worth a loss of money, let me say that again. **Your life isn’t worth any amount of money.** There are people that care about you way more than they care about your money. Things will get better. You will make it through. Message me or anyone else who volunteers at any time. I for one am here to listen if you need anything.


Edit: I meant to say “You’re life isn’t worth taking over any amount of money.” It was late for me.

 To all of those who have reached out to help with those reaching out for help I appreciate it.


Also, thanks for the awards much appreciated

Side note: Before you make large financial decisions make sure you know what you’re doing. WSB doesn’t tend to offer help to newer users as that’s not what it’s designed for. Watch some YouTube videos or subsequently check out r/wallstreetnoobs",It’s not worth it.,0.94,1614842599,IamCluLess
