46,m4ht4i,"Historical:

Oil prices have rallied over 100% from last year, after the kremlin and Saudi Arabia got into a disagreement last years OPEC meeting, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil over the weekend. The major issue was over the depth and extend of the oil cuts. Russia didnt believe in cutting oil, as they kept losing market share to American Oil companies. Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the prices propped up and extend the oil production cut agreement. 

&amp;#x200B;

This resulted in oil prices dropping to negative prices with added stress of covid 19. However, the biggest challenge to high oil prices was President Donald J. Trump. Prior to Covid 19, oil prices recovered from the 2014 oil crash in which oil prices fell to $20 a barrel. Oil prices reached prices as high as $80 per barrel. However, every time oil prices passed $70 a barrel he would tweet about the high prices, or give Saudi Arabia a call. However, Donnie T is gone, and we have a President Biden running the show. It is clear, from the past month, that president Biden is not willing to interfere and calm the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prediction:

As a result of the economy opening back up, vaccine distribution coming along, higher airline numbers,  Donald Trump is gone, and general compliance by the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries I expect the oil prices to move past 80 dollars in the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

Play:

I will play this environment by buying oil offshore drillers. My target company is $RIG. Rig has trippled in price since the start of the pandemic. While it does have 8 billion in debt, I think it could easily refinance this. Offshore drillers get paid per day by oil exploration companies to extract oil. This is called the day rate. At the low of the oil crash offshore drillers such as RIG were getting paid 150k, but that rate has reached a high of 350k. This will continue to increase as oil increases. Exploration companies have drastically reduced their operating investments. As the economy opens up, the exploration companies are going to be caught off their foot and will not be able to keep up with the oil demand.

&amp;#x200B;

$RIG is one of the few strong remaining offshore explorers that has survived the oil downturn. I like the stock and expect it to reach a high of $13 from its current price of $4.50. It has a market cap of 2 billion, 8 billion in debt, and around 8 billion in offshore contracts.  It has a book value of $18, while its price hovers at $4.5. A .5 or even 1 price to book value ratio indicates 100% - 400% upside.
