6,m3adc3,"All right, my first DD and hopefully a ticket to get some folks to Tendie-town. Let's talk about CureVac, $CVAC. Note that I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I just like this stock for money-making purposes.

I've been watching vaccine news and today Novavax announced that their vaccine candidate is 96% effective against COVID. $NVAX has jumped 20% in after-hours trading at the news, but for anyone not already in, the boat is missed. 

I'm not going to focus heavily on financials, board of directors, market saturation, blah blah blah. I'll give the highlights of what they're up to. They started phase 3 of their trial in December 2020, and expect to announce preliminary results 90 days later - so by end of March. Their version is stable for 90 days at normal refrigeration temps, like J&amp;J. January 11 they announced that their tests in non-human primates showed:
&gt;""Induction of robust antibody and T cell responses at lower dose than tested in Phase 3 trial""    
&gt;""Full lung protection of CVnCoV-vaccinated animals during SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection""

Full trial info (PDF warning): https://www.curevac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201214-CureVac-HERALD-Clinical-Trial-Protocol-of-Phase-2b_3_CVnCoV.pdf

There is a LOT more information in another DD posted by /u/kbxl [a few weeks ago](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liodt0/curevac_cvac_making_the_coronavirus_vaccine_for/) if you want to see some more. 

Now, about why this is the time. When Pfizer and Moderna  announced efficacy rates they saw reasonable, though short-lived, volume and price spikes. Johnson &amp; Johnson's announcement coincided with an earnings release so it can't be correlated. But, to make money on these you'd have to have already owned the shares or calls, and hop out on the ride up. Buy the rumor, sell the news. 

[Pfizer, announced efficacy 11/8, UK approval 12/2, USA 12/11](https://i.imgur.com/cySFVKX.png). They did also announce a 2021 Q1 dividend on 12/10, which surely helped share price - but it was already on the way up due to the approval news.

NovaVax made their announcement at the end of trading today, 3/11 and is up $40 (20%) in after-hours, from $187 to $226.

Final thoughts: I did my DD after hours so no positions yet. I don't have much to play with in my YOLO account (&lt;$500 avail) so I'm doing calls.

34,m3ak0r,"**All Shares when we purchase are registered by default by the Broker Street Name on the book. Hence, whoever owns the book deed, owns all rights including renting, borrowing funds, using them as collateral. We are only on the Broker internal pc and has insurance covering the number of Shares. But DRS is registering the Shares electronically on the Book deed under your name. This is Free. If enough of us transfer even a portion 50% into DRS then say the broker must register for us the legitimate shares. Then forces the dealer any remaining DRS shares requested to seek it from Shorts and forces the Squeeze. But DRS separate the shares as for us the broker must register the legitimate shares.**  

**For example with TDAmeritrade, I filled this:**[**tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_...**](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf) **then attached it internally under my account to TD stating transfer number of shares (Stock Symbol) to ""AST"" American Security Transfer. There is also PST (Philadelphia Stock Transfer) here is the link:** [**us.astfinancial.com/Content...**](https://us.astfinancial.com/Content/articles/15537_50.pdf?7/3/20115) **Since it is a new account when I filled the TDAmeritrade under Transfer account Number I put ""AST"" then transferred out and I got a letter of my account No from PST (so later I use the number to transfer back and forth by using the DRS application and submit to TDAmeritrade. The SEC explanation about it is here:** [**sec.gov/reportspubs/investo...**](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html) **but since we are under relentless Short Attack, the most advantage of this is forcing the broker to transfer and protect the legitimate Shares first and keep the naked shares at the broker.**  

**Large brokers can do the DRS. email your broker and ask them. Because DRS needs to initiate whether you transfer the shares into your name or back into street name to sell them when you need to. It is for free with the companies I listed above. If your broker does not do DRS or refuse to do it to discourage you like Robinhood does not. So I opened a free account with a broker than does first like TDAmeritrade. Then from TDAmeritrade, I used the Transfer fund feature and select from another broker and then follow Robinhood instruction:** [**robinhood.com/us/en/support...**](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/) **This stage Robinhood charged 75.**  

**For example with TDAmeritrade, I filled this:** [**https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf**](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100557.pdf)

Then attached it internally under my account to TD stating transfer number of shares SRNE to ""AST"" American Security Transfer. There is also PST (Philadelphia Stock Transfer) here is the link:

[https://us.astfinancial.com/Content/articles/15537\_50.pdf?7/3/20115](https://us.astfinancial.com/Content/articles/15537_50.pdf?7/3/20115)

Since it is a new account when I filled the TDAmeritrade under Transfer account Number I put ""AST"" then transferred out and I got a letter of my account No from PST (so later I use the number to transfer back and forth by using the DRS application and submit to TDAmeritrade. The SEC explanation about it is here:

[https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html)

So, from the time I filled the DRS and transferred out was 4 days. Then took 3 days to receive a letter by mail with my new account. Then to transfer back, I filled same DRS and stated to transfer back the shares and also scanned and attached the letter with my shares. It took about 3 days to see my shares back into my TDAmeritrade account. So the disadvantage one  can find is the few days needed to get the shares back into the account with the broker to be able to sell them.",Shares in Street Name VS Your name on the Book like who owns the property Deeds controls lending out or not,1.0,1615526384,Unique-bets

36,m3am79,"These are the same boomers who talked trash on peloton thinking it was just a stationary bike. Peloton’s business revolves around their cult following who love every aspect of the brand, the status behind it, and the trainers. Now think about Chewy, Ryan Cohen in an interview literally said that Chewy’s business model is sustainable because they have a cult following. People not only love their dogs and will spend money on them, but they love buying from Chewy specifically. They do not love buying their dog supplies from Amazon, Chewy makes the experience next level, they transformed the e-commerce experience. Why do I bring this up? Because this is exactly what Ryan Cohen invests in! Businesses that have star-power, cult followings, a revolution behind them. These business change the game, and you’ve all seen the recent evaluations of Peloton and Chewy, and you’ve seen what they WERE just a year ago. Any boomer who says GameStop is either worthless or won’t be worth anything for years is the same type of hater that called Amazon some pathetic book store run out of a garage. I mean Ryan Cohen is making big moves already, this man is in the peak of his career, he has no time to waste. I believe in this guy and I think I understand WHY he invested in GameStop. It’s all part of his master plan and how he picks business. He knows he has an army, a cult following, a revolution behind what he’s doing. Not only did we already hold a special place in our hearts for GameStop, but now it’s so much more than that. I for one would easily shop GameStop over Amazon, especially if RC truly makes the buyer experience next level like he did with Chewy. This seems elementary to me but so many people don’t see this. This company isn’t worth $1000+ because of a short or gamma squeeze, it’s worth that much as it is. Look at the revenue multiple and market cap and compare it to Peloton and Chewy a year ago and now. Tell me it doesn’t have room to grow? And it’s not even speculative, look at what RC is currently doing and what he’s ABOUT to do. He’s hinting at it with his tweets and all the PR that’s come outside then look at Amazon’s revenue multiple for example. I’m not saying GME = Amazon but I think GME is worth $1000 on it’s own, especially if it were to have a stock split. Obviously with the gamma squeeze potential it could be worth much much more in the short term but how do people think his would ever go back down to the levels they are mentioning. These investors are completely out of touch with innovation and the cult following this movement has created. I’m shocked that people can’t see what a diamond in the rough this investment is, even at these prices.. ESPECIALLY at these prices. If it was worth less we would be back down to those levels already, but we are stable. That’s because GameStop genuinely is the future, RC is the future, we are the future and we control GME’s destiny.",How do these boomers really think GameStop is equivalent to Blockbuster and worth nothing?,1.0,1615526573,poopstar21

Why they shorted for so high a fee? Honestly GME is much better at less than 1% fees :))

58,m3asf7,"So you decided you want to be an entrepreneur. There are high failure rates, the nonstop work, and if you’re one of the lucky few whose business takes off, you get to shoulder the responsibility of other people’s livelihood depending on you. Of course, there is the flexibility to work when you choose, the perk of being your own boss, and the rewarding feeling of building something meaningful.

You’ve weighed the pros and the cons and are convinced that being an entrepreneur is the way to go. But now you’re probably wondering, what type of business do I start?

Related: Low Cost Business Ideas

Here are the four questions I would suggest you consider before deciding what type of business you want to start:

1. Why are you deciding to start the business?

This is the most important question to answer before you do anything else. Are you looking for a more flexible lifestyle? Is your hope to generate a consistent flow of cash and not report to anyone? Is there a social impact or problem you’re trying to solve? The responses you come up with to these questions will help you narrow down the type of business you should start.

For example, if you want to maximize your flexibility and ability to maintain a social life, then you probably want to avoid the entertainment industry where people work nights and weekends. If you want a simple business that creates consistent cash flow, then you should probably start researching franchises. And if you’re looking to be a millionaire in the next five to 10 years, you probably need to invent the future and be comfortable with the thought of spending the majority of your waking hours for the next decade attempting to accomplish that desire.

2. What capital do you have access to?

Once you understand why you’re starting your business, you need to have a realistic evaluation of your cash and personal financing situation. The old adage “it takes money to make money” is especially true if you’re starting a new business. Evaluate all of your options carefully. Is it possible to get a small loan of a million dollars from your dad like Donald Trump did? Do you have to take on a loan? Are there assets you own that you can borrow against to get the seed capital that you need to get started? The type of capital and the amount of it that you have access to will dictate what business opportunities are available to you.

3. What do you know how to do?

Running and building a business requires a wide range of skills. You have to understand how to manage people, make tough decisions with limited information and track your finances. Have an honest conversation with yourself about your capabilities and your shortcomings. Some skills can be developed, while others usually can't. For instance, if you’re not the strongest manager that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go start your own business, it just means that you need to find someone who might be willing to mentor or advise you until you are able to hire one. With that said, you probably shouldn’t start a clothing line if you don’t know anything about retail.

Related: Business Plans: A Step-by-Step Guide

4. If this failed, would you regret it?

For every success story we read about in the entrepreneurial space there are probably 10 other stories of failure that weren’t written about. As a result, it is easy to forget that the odds are stacked against you.

So much of being an entrepreneur is about charting your own journey and deciding that you wouldn’t be content with the prescribed paths that others have lived or traveled. But far too often we get caught up thinking about the destination -- if we don’t make our destination, we feel like we failed. Remember that entrepreneurship is just about the journey and not the destination. So be sure to ask yourself, if you started this business and it failed because you didn’t reach your destination would you regret the journey?

Starting a business requires thoughtful reflection. The more time you put up front into evaluating an opportunity, the greater your odds of success will be. The last thing you want to do is second guess yourself. There will be too many others already doing that for you.

I posted gains to keep your attention on my balls, because thats what I use to do all of my thinking. P the fuck S 69694.20 is NOT a meme. If you are reading this, your wives boyfriends must not be home yet to take away your toys so here we go. I am a long time lurker but I have a brief observation and opinion that MIGHT explain the some of the games that have been going down with our favorite stonk and needs to be shared. You know about SI potential. You know about QE report. You know that a CEO has yet to be named. Ground was held today and blood was shed. All good reasons to hold and even better reasons to buy. BUT... In case you havent noticed, the short bus 🚌 fell off a fucking cliff  Wednesday despite all of this. It seems like the wedge funds targeted us paper hand cunts with a stop limit raid. This obviously triggered a domino effect that almost broke the zoo and scared the apes back into the trees. Those of you that held have my respect and gratitude. Those of you that had bullets to fire into the dip did so and stabilized the rocket. Also much respect and gratitude. This has been talked about already all over. Well played, well played mates. But, WTF happened today? Why no lift off? Why such low volume? What happens tomorrow. Ill tell you what my wifes boyfriend told me, but first....

 ...Here are some rockets so you window lickers dont fall asleep or some shit. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Do I have your attention again?

We didnt have lift off today because there was no volume and no bullets to be fired. Lemme esplain. If you are a paper handed cunt like me that was triggered when his safe space was hit, then you dumped. Also, if you were like me, back in Jan when we saw Papa Elon in orbit, you had restriction placed on your account for free trading. T+2 with restrictions means that none of us had fuel for the trip to Alpha fucking Centauri today either! What does this mean for tomorrow?  It means that all funds should be settle and cleared by the opening bell and we are about to ReLeAsE tHe KrAkeN the wedgies and shills. I can smell the rocket fuel now....it smells like sweet sweet tendies!

Its entirely probable that Im not an autist but a moron, and someone with a wrinkled brain can use their brand name crayons to draw me a picture of why Im wrong before I YOLO my freshly settled gainz back into gamestonks.

Oh yeah, some more fuckin rockets as a reward for making it to the end. I dont want anyone having seizures or some shit . 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

93,m3b410,"Hi Everyone,

All these posts about paying back student loans with meme stocks profits are heartwarming ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lef7fe/im_a_paper_handed_bitch_but_my_student_loans_are/) [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0walz/since_round_two_started_ive_had_a_limit_in_at_200/) [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lozsks/sorry_for_the_shitty_screenshot_but_thanks_for/)).

But what are you guys doing with all the money after you paid back your debt and bought that [fancy car](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1hwmb/found_an_autismobile_belonging_to_a_fellow_ape/)?

Yesterday I saw a CNN report on what is going on in [Yemen](https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSKBN2AR07P): as a parent and a human being, this is heartbreaking. I don't understand how any human can do this to another...

[According to the UN](https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/01/yemen-faces-a-famine-as-deadly-as-ethiopia-s-during-the-1980s-says-refugee-council-head), the aid funds required to help these kids is of $4 billion. It seems mostly nobody gives a s\*t (in 2020 only half of this sum was raised). Hedgies are mostly focused on [saving their own ass](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/cohen-s-point72-raises-1-5-billion-after-melvin-infusion). And Vlad ""Excellent Question"" certainly has [other things](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos-.html) on his mind.

That CNN report really got to my nerve, so I open up the [UN page](https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/how-donate-united-nations-system/) today with one question on my mind: ""How can I help!"". Apparently there's lots of things.

Looking at the number of degenerates on this sub and thinking back at [last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3k9ie/2_million_degenerates/), the only thing that comes to mind is ""apes strong together"".

I've already done my part. If you want to, you can also do it [here](https://act.unfoundation.org/onlineactions/8OWBf5tPG02WcTsyv86ENA2) or [here](https://giving.unhcr.org/en/yemen/).
