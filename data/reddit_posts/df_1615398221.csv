It‚Äôs halted for us but not them, remember that they will be ladder shorting it to drive price down so they can close their shorts at much lower price, it will re open again I think below 100

But that just means we can buy more 

If you want to know the truth price just put it a buy order for a couple of dollars, it most likely will get rejected but it should show current price which will be different to online charts

For me it‚Äôs 155 right now but online apps and charts still show 200+
