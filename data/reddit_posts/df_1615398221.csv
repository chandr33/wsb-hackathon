It’s halted for us but not them, remember that they will be ladder shorting it to drive price down so they can close their shorts at much lower price, it will re open again I think below 100

But that just means we can buy more 

If you want to know the truth price just put it a buy order for a couple of dollars, it most likely will get rejected but it should show current price which will be different to online charts

For me it’s 155 right now but online apps and charts still show 200+

This was a very large volume being sold all at once before the halt, and the continuation of selling it causing more blows (not what your wife does to her boyfriend). Possible whale leaving? 

Either way, don’t add to the drop by getting spooked.
