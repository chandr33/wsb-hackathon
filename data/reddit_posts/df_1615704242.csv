I wanted to suggest that if someone is still looking for where to make a difference [Inti Wara Yassi community](https://www.intiwarayassi.org/sponsor-an-animal/) is always in desperate need for support! You can sponsor a specific animal as well!

 I volunteered in one of their refugees in Bolivia, and they are legit! The work they are doing is amazing, they have many different animals over there including a lot of monkeys (and big cats like pumas). The pandemic is making everything really hard over there because they are depended on tourists that volunteer and donates.

Have you ever heard of the story about Noahs ark? Chances are that you probably have. But for those who haven’t, let me briefly explain.

Noahs ark was a large vessel in which was said where god spares noah, his family and examples of all the worlds animals from a catastrophic flood. In sequence, it looks something like this:

-	Noah pleases god (Keith pleases himself)
-	Noah builds an Ark (Keith buys a yacht)
-	The animals come to noah (Ape Strong move in with Keith and adopt hair ape cousins)
-	Noah and family enter the ark (Keith and ape family board the yacht)
-	A flood covers the earth (Flood = Financial Shit Storm caused by Melvin and Shitadel)
-	The flood subsides (stonks go up)
-	Noah leaves the ark (Noah and his family take their GME Tendies and disembark the yacht)

I've woken up this morning in the UK to see some amazing things taking place once again, not only do we have some incredible minds within this community but we also have some of the most kind-hearted people I've ever witnessed on an Internet platform.

Animals have always been at the core of my life, I own several dogs and I'm a firm believer in giving a new lease of life to these individuals. I consider them my own children. With that in mind I would like all of those who have taken the time to adopt animals or contributed to the wellbeing of another individual off the back of this stock frenzy to give yourself a great deal of credit because you are the most amazing kind of human.
