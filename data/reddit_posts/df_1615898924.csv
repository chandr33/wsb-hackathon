50,m68l4t,"I generally just lurk and use this account to read further into the comment sections (reddit only lets you read so many comments without logging in). I had a question about short selling, and in general a question about the top short sellers, top meaning the most experienced (TL;DR at the bottom):

If the short sellers are smart and have an entire trading career looking for ways to capitalize on shorting stocks, it would be safe to assume they know how ""normal"" traders use algorithms/indicators to look for trade opportunities (both long and short). Reading through this subreddit and others, I haven't really found an answer to a question I had:

If there are millions of shares that have a stop loss trigger to either minimize risk or lock in gains, wouldn't it be smart for short sellers to find out where people are setting their stop loss, and exploit it?

Let's say for instance I just bought a stock, and everything I'm reading is telling me to set a stop loss order to cap losses, and then as the stock goes up I move that stop loss order up with the market to lock in my gains. I believe the term used is a ""trailing stop loss."" Now let's say thousands of other traders are doing the same thing. Wouldn't it be possible to start a domino effect on the downslide? 

Another question I have is with the whole payment for order flow: Are these stop loss orders visible to the clearing firms or just the brokers?

If I were a short seller, and I knew I could profit from tanking a stock that continually rebounds, I would just keep doing it over and over until the steam runs out from buyers. As the stock hits the bottom, you buy your shares back, wait for the stock prices to rise again, and rinse and repeat. At this point you don't even have to short stocks; you can just use real stocks to trigger stop loss orders. This of course assumes that the amount of shares you own are enough to drop the prices significantly enough to trigger such an event.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not suggesting anything, just asking questions for my own curiosity.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

If short sellers are able to trigger stop loss orders repeatedly, could they use real shares to drop the price, and when the price hits a low, buy those shares back and wait for buyers to raise the price to start the next round?",Short Selling / Stop Loss Question,1.0,1615899838,deflatted

62,m68n62,"Hello fellow investors,

It has come to my attention that there has been a huge increase in post regarding donations to certain animal/ape charities. Now this is all good and all that some of us are actually donating our profits for the good. There also has been an increase in memes as well. I myself have enjoyed some of these funny mee mees and the content might seem original but I think this is all just a bunch of FUD. 

**My Theory** 

When the GME rocket was still early, back in January and February, I was seeing a lot more informative post regarding stonks, and less memes. I think there always needs to be a fine balance of memes and stonk news/ education but lately it just seems that r/wallstreetbets has just turned into a meme board. So my theory is that these hedgie bots and shills have just been shoveling memes down our throats as a distraction from the real data that is coming from these meme stonks. I think people tend to make better irresponsible spending decisions when there is a bit more information. I have barley seen anything regarding spending stimmy checks, and I would think that would be the number one talked about thing on this subreddit.

64,m68ngq,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts California is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current NON-GOVERNATOR government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of Hollywood California. Due to systemic nepotism, there are Stanford teachers that don't know what IP-addresses are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never not fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The NON-GOVERNATOR Government solved this, against advise of Mel Gibson, with constant remakes. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the Hollywood Buck which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates of Silicon Valley (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison watch dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as TSLA stock and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated opinions comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). Californians are more likely to have their privilege checked than any other state as there are so many tales of Political Correctness and shaming and threats of getting cancelled. This equates to the most based citizens leaving CA and most CA based businesses diversifying out of the state as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Californian in history Steve Jobs who is now a dead American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock. 
I first thought about shorting California over a year ago when I was researching ~~hot Hollywood actors~~ the state.  (I'm a diamond hand, I read much on the state for fun). I found the only index tracking CA (ECA) wasn't an accurate representation of CA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of CA (mostly to other parts of America). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on CA going full Paper Hands/Detroit. Detroit having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.
My new broker, Harambe's Diamond Hands, allows negative currency positions as long you post your kids as collateral. Now my native currency are HarambeCoin, where inflation in 2020 was fekkin' high while the Hollywood Buck was fekkin' higher in 2020. That equals a super-fekkin' high return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting HarambeCoin inflation to stay between fekkin' low to fekkin' lower every year while the Hollywood Buck (ticker HOBO) stays north of 69% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs.

We are strong together and can achieve more than anyone has seen in this market, just look at the news.  The 1 percent are afraid of what we can do and they want to stop us.

We saw a bunch of apes throw every penny they have at these stocks and watched them soar.  Yesterday we broke 14 bucks on AMC like it was nothing!  They are bringing us down premarket because they know we have fewer numbers early on, they know people will see and panic sell, they know people dont want to lose money.  STAY THE COURSE!

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

We pushed thru and made another all-time high in the spy can we push higher? The 3 outcomes to prepare for are:1) We continue to hold 393 support area (also watch 395 area could hold there, lot of traffic around there) we continue pushing smaller new all-time high (journey to 400) with a widening range to the downside preparing for fed speak on Wed. 3.17.21. 2) We Break support at 393, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 392. 3) we drop and crack support at 390 area before consolidating and making way to possible buy fed speak on Wednesday. 

1) We continue to hold 393 support area (also watch 395 area could hold there, lot of traffic around there) we continue pushing smaller new all-time high (journey to 400) with a widening range to the downside preparing for fed speak on Wed. 3.17.21. **50% probability** 

2) We Break support at 393, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 392. **40% probability**
