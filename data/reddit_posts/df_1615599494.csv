A little taste! But no! They want us all poor, be forever peasants. They let the small guy play in their game, laugh at us, condescend us, then the minute the little guy wins? THAT’S A BIG NO NO...

13,m3wdhu,"I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual’s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely naïve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. 

I also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we’re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don’t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don’t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don’t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. 

There are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don’t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).

My point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you’re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. 

Three years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You’re telling me that these dumb hedgies can’t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. 

GME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. 

Think about it...their argument is don’t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It’s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally. They cant take that route because it would be planet of the apes part seven or some thing.","There are more retail investors than ever, but we don’t have the power to tank markets.",1.0,1615599723,Thorbeans

15,m3wdpf,"I am somewhat new to options trading, I read two books two months ago one called ""lifecycle investing"" and another called ""ages of the investor"" and both books seemed to point out a basic strategy of buying deep in the money leaps (long calls - 3 years out) on SPY or IWM for the first ten years of your investing life to basically diversify your equity across time and apparently statistically is better than just buying and holding the same stocks. Basically ended up doubling my money with the Spy/Iwm LEAPS shortly after. I'm reading around and it seems everyone else has a far more complex strategy, some of which I don't even understand. I'm wondering why people don't simplify their strategies? I bet all the complexity is to shift around risk, not necessarily better unless you know something nobody else does to accurately predict the market.

Artificial pre and after market - fines with no transparency (fake numbers reports fines) -- Pattern Day Trading Laws - Settlement periods - **halting** trading of companies just because they feel like it -

SEC allowing hedgefunds to solely run on IBM Watson like software that specifies trade routing systems with data on **trading patterns** while also using that data to make their own trades for profit.

read that last line again.

That is how hedgefunds manipulate and control the ""**FREE MARKET**""

They play the upside and downside of trades, pin the price, and make money both ways by setting algorithms.

the manipulation - has been blatant, glaring and obvious

Hedgefund scare tactics we've seen thus far.

ladder attacks - manipulation of the entire market - synchronized market drops - bot attacks - reverse psychology bots - professional manipulators - stop loss raids - diversion tactics - silver - all the bs.

**DONT FORGET THEY CONTROL THE MEDIA**

Time to shut down their ""free market"" and **Expose the Criminals.**

My favorite movie is Point Break. Ex Presidents exposing the Hedgefund run ""Free Market""

My favorite President JFK.

“We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.” - JFK

Listen To **JFKs Speech about Secret Societies. The Time is Now.** This is a must watch 5 minute video.

**WE NEED FULL ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION. FREE AND INDEPENDENT.**
