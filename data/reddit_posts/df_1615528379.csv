2,m3b626,"I love AMC and GME, in 7k shares in both.  Wanted to get a little thought in diversifying for the group. Don't want all your eggs in one basket. Also Iv is so high on both options do not pay very well without a huge stock move which is going to become harder and harder as the price moves uo.

I am in about $250k in the 4 tickers in the title.  These have all been hit hard in the last 2 to 4 weeks for different reasup. And are down 20 to 40% each off of recent ath. Each is poised for a huge recovery.  The best part is all 4 have relatively low IV so Calls will pay big.

Look at each and make your decision.

Some of you may look at COST at think what a boomer play but because it is a stable mature company IV is super low.  Also because it is relatively expensive stock a 1-2% daily move will move the option price quickly. I could see this stock running 10 to 15% in the next 2 to 3 weeks which will pay big.","Yolo - OSTK, COST, AMD, FSLY",1.0,1615528440,neothedreamer

16,m3ba9b,"I get it. We’re all more or less retarded semi-hominids around here. But we play with real money, and a lot of us seem to get caught up in the excitement of this casino and try to win the lotto without knowing what the fuck is going on. 

I’d bet that most of us know how a stock works. Ape buy share, ape hold share. Yes, ape can lose money, but generally speaking, it probably won’t be a total loss (zero bananas for those who need the conversion). 

Options are different. Way different. Stocks are like riding a cute ape-sized circus tricycle, and options are like driving an F1 car with the accelerator taped to the floor and all of the wheel lug nuts loosened. They can (and most do) go to zero. And they can (and often do) lose significant value at dizzying speed. 

Every time I see a post that contains something like “I don’t even know how to spell opshuns, but I bought 35 naked OTM calls expiring tomorrow for $90,000” I just get disheartened. Because real people will lose lots of real money playing with options, and I get it - Market University comes for us all, but please, PLEASE at least educate yourself on options basics before jumping in. Watch some YouTube videos. InTheMoney has a good intro series that I’ve seen, and there’s tons and tons of quality content. Learn about spreads to lower your risk and theta exposure, learn about the Greeks, learn about what premium actually is and how it affects your break even price. I see so many “if this stonk gets to the strike price by exp it will print!” Like... no goddammit, at the strike will be worth zero dollars at expiration, and until you pass the strike plus what you paid for the option, you’re not making any money. You should be trading the contracts anyways, not holding to expiration (most people, I’d say).

Anyways, we’re all adults here, but I care about my fellow apes. Learn the shit, then hop in. You’ll still probably lose everything, but at least you’ll know the fuck why. 

You’ll get more financial advice reading the color names printed on crayon wrappings than listening to me.","For the love of Harambe, learn the fuck up about options before you enter a trade",1.0,1615528830,MCS117

19,m3bb6g,"In 2020 esports made $960 million globally, and that figure is expected to increase to $1.6 billion by 2023 [statista link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/518010/leading-esports-players-worldwide-by-earnings/#:~:text=eSports%20market%20growth&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20worldwide%20revenues%20generated,almost%201.6%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.).

In the US, the demographics of viewership are going the wrong way. The average age of sports watchers in the US is increasing [don't hate me for the cnbc link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/13/why-the-super-bowl-is-losing-the-18-49-demographic.html). This is bad for ad revenues, and ultimately for sports earnings. What the cnbc article gets wrong isn't that betting is a good draw for a younger audience, it's that a younger audience doesn't give a fuck about dudes crushing each other into permanent disability for money.

What the new generation wants is video games [I know. MW](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990). But more than video games, we want to see excellence and professionalism to give us something to aspire to, admire, and maybe want to beat.

What GameStop could be poised to deliver after the pandemic is a chain of not just game stores, but internet cafes, training venues for esports teams- amateur and professional, leagues, sponsorships, and televising rights. Sports globally make $471B per year. You're kidding yourself if you don't think esports can't be at least a $100 billion industry.in 20-30 years, with GameStop sitting at the top of the US market.","If GameStop builds through real vision, buying today could be like getting in on the NFL at the ground floor",0.99,1615528915,JustWingIt0707
