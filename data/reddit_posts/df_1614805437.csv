**GEVO. It closed at $8.25 today. Trust me, here is why:**

\- Average price target: $17.00

\- Green energy is the future, planes will need to go to biofuel and many airlines have committed to switching to biofuel already.

\- The co-founder of GEVO was named to Joe Biden's science team.

\- They have zero debt with 535 million in cash.

\- They have made deals with all of the mainstream airlines.

\- Nine days ago they announced a 100 million dollar deal with a Scandanavian airline system.

\- Their last price offering was at $8.00 and I doubt that the price will fall even lower than that.

89,lx4kj0,"We all know that last year, March 2020, the stock market **TANKED** due to the COVID shutdown - (The S&amp;P dropped 31% in 1 week!)

This stock market crash prompted millions of investors to **""buy the dip""**.

YTD from March 2020 to March 2021 we've seen some impressive gains to say the least - (Apple saw a **117% gain** from March 2020 to Feb 2021).

My theory is, in order to avoid the short-term capital gains tax you must leave your investment in a security for over 1 year...

That being said, I believe we will see a massive movement of selling off and taking profits around mid March from investors who bought the 2020 dip and want to avoid the capital gains tax. 

P.S. I know nothing and most of what I say I've heard form someone smarter than me and just regurgitated. So, if I'm absolutely wrong ill take it like a man but this is just my thought on what to expect from next month.

**TLDR; Mid-Late March will see a HUGE sell off due to investors avoiding short-term capital gains tax followed by a huge bull-run.**",Mid March 2021 crash?,0.83,1614806173,MR_FUMAR
90,lx4kk2,"Disclosure: Long ATSG

Bought ATSG because, you know America, packages, flying....good.

But there's also the fact that Amazon owns warrants allowing them to buy 19.9% of the company for $9.73 a share...and those warrants expire March 8th, 2021.

Why is no one talking about this? Feeling lonely on this.
