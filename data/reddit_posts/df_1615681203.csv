How beautiful would it be that when GME moons we apes put a huge, never before seen effort towards preserving the fucking rainforest for all Apes and monke and their forest buddies?

Let's make a pledge bois.
Imagine retards saving the planet in the end.
This would be some next level autism. 

Being so autistic that u literally divert HF billions into monke home preservation instead of another five hundred yachts on the shores of Macao, Miami or Monaco.

I know I don't need to say it again because by now we all know but:

Ape together strong 

TL;DR:
Let's protecc monke home 

So let's put many banana into monke home protecc

So all monke can eat banana

14,m4jjwr,"I just wanted to express that the memes and gifs and videos and songs really are helping me weather through the storm with a lot more peace of mind. Seeing the positivite energy around here is so much better than it was when this place was pretty toxic like a month ago.

Like the league of legends one yesterday was fucking epic. And the fact that Redditors are using earnings to fucking adopt gorillas to an extent that the president of the foundation actually thanked WSB. 

So in my opinion, every new GME meme is better than the last and I'm not going to be sick of them until this shit moons or goes bankrupt (spoiler- that won't happen). Keep 'em coming as far as I'm concerned, and thank you for making this wild ride even better with your creativity!

27,m4jof2,Last night I went to sleep with a smile because of the 1st gorilla adoption.  Made me so happy and it was such a hilarious thread.  As I wanted to show my SO that post tonight I ran into the video thanking WSB for the multiple adoptions and then tears... I couldn't finish my sentence because my voice broke and I started crying... YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!! It reminded me the post of another ape saying that billionnaires who earn another million dont see much of a change in their lives but regular people like you and me when we have access to this kind of money we give back and change our communities.   I pledge here and now that once GME hits 150K I will give 25K as a donation to a sanctuary near me for primates who have been used in lab experiments.   Google Fauna Faundation dot org.  Dr Allen does an amazing job here and they can use my donation.  Apes helping apes!! APES STRONGER TOGETHER.  A quick hello to my fellow Bonobos.  Diamond hands !!

40,m4jrkt,"Apes,

I've done hundreds of hours of research.  I've looked at hundreds, probably even thousands, of graphs, models, articles, analysis, discussions, memos, FUD, hype, etc... and I've come to one very simple conclusion.

It's so fucking simple that our smooth brains are struggling to accept it.  Here it is distilled into five steps that even an ape can understand:

Step 1:
Buy.

Step 2:
Hodl.

Step 3:
Be patient.

Step 4:
Continue to be patient or go back to step 1.

Step 5:
Profit beyond your wildest dreams.
