I live on a boat I bought for 50K on a caribbean island in Mexico.  Spending just $1500 a month I live like a king.  Beaches, pina coladas, and beautiful women.

If you take that 500K and get a measly 5% from it a year you are done.  Finished.  You can retire.  All you have to do is change your thinking.

// It all started a few months ago
// When the hedgies did a bit too much blow

GameStock, they said was going to plummet.
//It’s dieing retail, it’ll never reach the summit 
//But little did they know there was not a cat in town
//Who noticed the antics of these hedgie clowns

Buy the dip he said from $4 to $2
//It was dismal it seemed, the buying was through
//But then all of a sudden, Ryan Cohen hopped aboard
//He bought into the stock, this could not be ignored!

People realized the value of this great stonk
//The price skyrocketed, the hedge funds in shock
//But then the hedgies thought we cannot let this be
//Retail traders, beating us? We’re losing our money tree.

//So the hedgies decided they would take a stand.
//Against “dumb money” (that’s us) and the WSB brand.
//They gave millions to officials news outlets and more
//To spread the story that GME would make everyone poor

Their FUD wasn’t working billions down the drain
//They decided to restrict trading to stop the retail gain
//No more shares could be bought, you could only sell
//The problem is, we didn’t hear no bell

As the stock dropped to $40, I sank to my knees
//The market was rigged and I didn’t have the keys
//They change the rules when they want
//As the ultra rich twitter warriors, gloat and taunt

The paper hands started screaming, we told you so!
//In disbelief I saw the number -90% and below.
//But then I realized a small and true fact
//That I could actually survive these attacks

It wasn’t a loss until I actually sold
//So I did something others, might have called bold.
//I doubled down on my shares and lowered my cost
//As the price continued to decrease all seemed to be lost

Then a glimmer of light started to shine through.
//The headbanded investor bought more for me and for you.
//This catalyst was all that the stock seemed to need
//As the price rose, and hedgies again started to bleed.

The price hit almost $400 and dropped like a rock
//$198 the chart said, the chat screaming what the fock
//The price jumped back up quick and went back to even
//I doubled my resolve, this is a stock to believe in

And now we have made it to today
//What side are you on and with what do you play 
//Make a choice, hold or buy if you can
//Just make sure you are going in with your own plan.

GameStonk to the moon, yet again it seems
//It can stay a great rocket, just through all the great memes
//To the moon we may go, keep us In your prayers
//At the end of the day, power to all the players


TL:DR : The GME story from a point of view that is entirely my own. 🤲💎🦍🚀

47,m3i8kc,"So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? Sure, *if you want to lose your title of millionaire*. However, if you 'd like to stay a millionaire, there are some things you may like to consider. *This is not financial advice,* but rather, 3 pieces of life suggestions. A survival guide so to speak, of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title.

&amp;#x200B;

* First, protect it from everyone else.

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well everyone is gonna want a cut. They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not the harm they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

In that case, you've gotta be the bad guy. You've gotta be the one to say, ""no."" And friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. *Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&amp;#x200B;

* Second, protect it from expenses.

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a source of *income.* An easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to poverty. You don't deserve that.

&amp;#x200B;

* Third, protect it from yourself.

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per part 1.**Don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners, roughly 35% of which go *bankrupt*. Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

&amp;#x200B;

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America.

https://i.redd.it/6zrwsfsstlm61.gif

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of either decision.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Wheter it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if wallstreetbets occupies a position of pre-eminene can we help decide wheter this new ocean will be a sea of tendies or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of GME any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of other stonks, but i do say that GME can be held and squeezed without feeding the pockets of hedgefunds, without repeating the mistakes that papershands has made in previous dipps. 

But why, some say, hold? Why choose this as our stonk? and they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? why, 94 years ago, fly the atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?

We choose to hold this stonk.
We choose to hold this stonk and buy the dip, not because it is easy, but because we believe in it; because we are autists; because the hedgefunds cannot win; because that stonk is one that we are willing to invest in, one we are unwilling to sell, and one we intend to bring to the moon, and the others too.

56,m3iaqh,"Hello, fellow apes.

I want to get this out there before the market opens. There is a decent chance it doesn't happen today. I hope I am wrong of course but here is why I think it might not.

This is all with the premise that their end goal is to get us to panic sell.

1. Some of the media peeps are saying we should see something happen today.
2. If they can manipulate the price of the stock why wouldn't they make it look like last time before it blasted off into the moon before it got pulled back down by RH's gravitational pull? This would get people more excited and therefore more crestfallen when nothing happens.
3. IN ADDITION TO NUMBER 2: Roughly 50% of the call options that are propelling this squeeze upwards are going to expire today. So I believe that no matter what, if we see lift off or not, the price will most likely float back down to previous levels and I don't want people to be discouraged because of that either.

Here's why:

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".
