28,lx3dje,"Bionano Genomics has been a hot stock last few months as they went from $0.50 to $15 in a few months. Right now due to market volatility they are down to $8.68.

Their earnings are 3/16, so two weeks from today and they got a few things going for them.

1. Pandemic created even more demand for genome sequencing, which is ~~what they do.~~ Correction, they don't, they do optical mapping. Thanks to those who know more than I do.
2. They just today announced that they have received codes needed as a first step for medical billing systems using their Saphyr platform for tests that can be ordered. This will  make it easy, clear and otherwise streamline the process of requesting, getting and billing for tests using their technology. They are working with Praxis on this. This means that their tech will be used not only by research organizations or specialized facilities and universities, but potentially by the medical providers working with the general public directly. This not an insignificant step for a much wider adoption of their technology, thus bigger revenue.
3. They are still working with universities and research labs around the world on showing how useful the Saphyr system is for rapid genome work.
4. They will be featured at AGBT 2021 showing discoveries made with their systems, which in turn is likely to cause further interest and adoption of their tech.
5. Saphyr system  is accurate and is much cheaper than some of the other competitors ($10K vs $500 in some cases).
6. Their system was used to further improve the accuracy and completeness of the human genome information for diverse populations, which in turn allows scientist to look for new therapeutic targets in those populations. While not directly beneficial to BNGO in itself, this helps to advance their system as the system of choice for similar work.
7. Lastly,  they have earnings on 3/16 and the premiums are still reasonable. There is a good chance of a run up the week and days preceding earnings call. IV is a bit high, but should still have enough room.

TL;DR  3/19  $9c (corrected from 3/16, which is their earnings date)

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly not an investment advice, just sharing my thinking on why I like it.","BNGO - take off in 2 weeks, still reasonable premium",0.78,1614802897,ElegantEntropy

83,lx3jl7,"Alright folks, remember the day **GameStop** rallied hard on 27 January? Transocean (RIG) rallied hard too, indicating that there are big dogs short sellers ""hiding"" in it too. 

Transocean (RIG) is one of the oil stocks that rallied well today, not until when it reached around 4.0950, a giant candle with huge volume was dumped on the stock at around 12:20pm. The short seller shorted a little more at 2.05pm and 2.30pm, both are very obvious with high volume. With oil price being this high and oil stocks being this bullish, we can easily squeeze this high. And RIG is good at squeezing, just look at its **300%+ squeeze** back in 4-8 June 2020. 

Fundamentally, RIG is full of cash and the insiders have only bought their own stock, never sold any, giving me a lot more confidence that it's not gonna go bust. Let's blow this baby up :)",RIG - Shorted by some BIG DOGS,0.35,1614803365,Memory_Secret

91,lx3jwu,"Hello fellow Autists,

Since we've all been interested in high short interest stocks for possible squeeze events. One thing came up on my radar called $SDC (Smile Direct Club). They are a teledentistry platform that provides member's with a customized clear aligner therapy treatment in the United States and internationally. 

The company took a pretty big hit in revenue during the pandemic last year but has been recovering over the past few quarters, I'll leave chart for dumb dumb's below.

https://preview.redd.it/yd94oxoigvk61.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2755552fe51f5c43407cf876a69dcd39158db62c

Given that before the pandemic they were trading at 16 - 20 dollars a share which I believe is totally undervalued given the fact that they just got a deal with MetLife a major insurance company in November. The company should be on a one way ticket to tendie town. 

&amp;#x200B;

The short interest on this company is massive: 25% of the entire stock is short which I'll leave a screen cap below for proof

https://preview.redd.it/sj1019bhgvk61.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac227daed495234ba08ccc2b02c919e551aec93

One final note, our good friends at Citadel have also decided to join in on the fun for shorting the company, I'll leave a screen cap of their most recent 13F form, but wouldn't it be hilarious if they take yet another L when it comes to WSB and high short interest stocks. (Yes I know it was Melvin Capitol who held the position for GME but still involved with RH on the trade shutdown).
