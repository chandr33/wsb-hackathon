3,ly3g1k,"Put this together and thought it might be helpful to some.

Simple spreadsheet of the stocks I track showing max, min, and avg stock price for 2021, current price, and % of potential gains if the stock returns to the average or max.  I'm using this to narrow the field of stocks to research before investing my soon-to-be GME gains.  Max, min, and current are all closing prices - made it much easier to compile.

There are some outliers, so DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Some are dipping hard because of the company, not just because the markets dipping.  Some stocks have current prices below the min, so they may continue to drop.  This sheet is not investment advice or meant to be used by itself.  If you see something you like, dig deeper.

The list doesn't capture a lot of big stocks, so if you want me to add something let me know.

First post, so feel free to rip me to shreds.
