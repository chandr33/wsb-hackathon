What the hell were you thinking?

You guys are already out billions of dollars, and things are due to get a whole lot worse for you come 03/19. I don’t know what’s possessing you to short retail stocks further, but hey, now I’m curious to try whatever it is you’re smoking. You just ensured that you’re losses will be a whole lot worse than they would’ve been an hour ago. Are you prepared to meet those steeply climbing margin requirements or are you just panicking at this point? Personally, your kicking and screaming is making a lot of us here rich as fuck. Aren’t you getting tired of fighting the inevitable?

You made a mistake. You lost. Cut your losses and pay retail investors what you owe them or hemorrhage even harder and keep shorting. Your call.

And have fun. You fucking earned it.","Hey, hedge fund managers: If you’re reading this right now, consider not digging your hole deeper while you still can. (Mods can you please not delete this)",1.0,1615405707,BankruptHedgesOrBust
