25,m25l6k,"Something really isn't right, i'll explain why.


So today I thought it would be fun to watch the price on my Trading 212 app while I was working.

I saw it go up to $340 when I then noticed that the price froze at $340.08 for 15 minutes - it didn't move up or two a single cent.

I thought ""what the fuck? No way, are they manipulating this again!?"" when I fucking shit you not, Trading 212 sends me a push notification saying ""GME rallies to $330"".

Looking at my screen I thought, but it's at $340.08?

Then BAM, it must've been 5 seconds after that push notification, the prices BOMBS straight down to $190 triggering my buy limit. This buy limit should NOT have triggered as the app clearly stated that trading was halted as NYSE had halted trading.

I have about £500 left in my account for buying. So, when this started going back up, i've just tried to put a buy limit - 2 for $190 - it won't let me. It says I do not have enough funds to cover 2 stocks @$190 - that's $380 so about £330- so I have another £170 in my account.

I can however place a buy order for 1 stock @$190.

But then when I try and place a second buy order for $190, it says I do not have enough funds.

I honestly think this is more to do with market makers and the apps not having enough actualy stock of GME, and kot enough liquidity and cash to pay out sells.",Shady shit is going down on Trading 212 - GME,1.0,1615403093,TimsKillerRabbit

I believe in this company and business practice and I believe everyone here (minus the fake accounts) just want to succeed and do well.  We want the best for each other and if it means $$$$$$ gains then let's hope for that.

84,m25ors,"Dear fellow retards and crayon-eating apes,

Today I would like to present you my first DD of a German DAX company: Deutsche Telekom, the mother company of $TMUS, which got recently included in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio by legend Warren Buffett. I would like to show you why I think that Deutsche Telekom is even a better buy than §TMUS.

**1) Solid figures, strong strategic market position, and growth outlook. Main growth drivers are an increasing glass fiber rollout potential and its 5G/cell tower portfolio.**

Deutsche Telekom is the biggest European integrated telecommunications company, with some 242 million mobile customers, 27 million fixed-network lines, and 22 million broadband lines. Deutsche Telekom is present in more than 50 countries, with its main business in Germany and US. On February 26, 2021 the Deutsche Telekom published its results for the 2020 financial year:

* Increase in **revenue of 25.4 percent to 120.1 bn. $ /101.0 billion euros**
* Adjusted **EBITDA AL increased by 41.6 percent to 41.7 bn. $/ 35.0 billion euros**
* **+388,000 broadband customer** additions in Germany
* Larger T-Mobile US records **5.5 million postpaid customer additions**
* Guidance for 2021: **adjusted EBITDA AL of around 37 billion euros** (44.1$) and **free cash flow AL of around 8.0 billion euros (9.5 $)**

The **earnings forecast shows a growth of roughly 13.2% per yea**r over the next years. The general outlook is positive.

**2) Market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom is far below its fair value with a 132 to 194% stock price potential**

Based on 2020 figures, the industry ratio of market capitalization and annual revenue for the big US players lies in a range between 1.24x to 2.24x, with a Top 3 average of 1.77x:

* **$TMUS T-Mobile US**: 153.2 bn. $ market cap / 68.4 bn. € annual revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **2.24x**
* **$ VZ Verizon Communications:** 234.5 bn. $ market cap / 128.3 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.83x**
* **$T AT&amp;T Inc.**: 212.8 bn $ market cap / 171.8 $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **1.24x**
* **Deutsche Telekom:** 91.5 bn. $ market cap / 120.1 bn. $ revenue (2020) with market cap/revenue ratio of **0.76x**

A fair value for Deutsche Telekom based on the Top 3 industry average of 1.77x would lead to a **fair share price of** **44.64$/37,53€,** which is a **premium of 132%** compared to the current share prices of 19.22$/16,16€. Applying the ratio of its subsidiary §TMUS of 2.24x would even lead to a **stock price potential of 194% resulting in 56.5$/47.50€ share price**. The price-to-earnings ratio is 17.6x and below the industry average of 25.3x (source: [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st/)).

**3) The market capitalization of US subsidiary TMUS is worth 65.9 bn.$ - so the remaining business of Deutsche Telekom is worth half its revenue!**

After the Sprint-merger, Deutsche Telekom owns 43% of all shares of its subsidiary TMUS, with an option to buy the remaining 8% from Softbank until June 2024 (half of the shares for 06/2020 TMUS stock price of roughly 100$). Based on today’s value, the TMUS participation is worth 65.9 bn. $, which is already 72% of Deutsche Telekom's overall market cap. So, the remaining international business of DT with **51.7 bn. $ revenue is only evaluated 25.6 bn. $!**

**4) The analyst outlook is very promising, showing a conservative 27% upside potential over the next 12 months**

Based on 13 analyst reports, the 12 months forecast shows a possbile stock price of 24,40$/20,50€, which is a premium of roughly 27% to today's stock price. The range across all analysts is between 20.23$ (Deutsche LB) and 29,25$ (JP Morgan Chase) including 12 Buy and 1 Hold recommendations.

**5) A high dividend yield of roughly 4% over the past 20 years makes it the most stable and reliable German dividend stock.**

**6)** **Risks:**

To me, a comprehensive DD should also cover the risks involved, especially when outlook and forecast seems too good to be true,

* During the dot-com bubble, Deutsche Telekom showed a crazy race towards its ATH of 120$/100€ in 2000, followed by a crash down to 12$/10€ within the next two years. This led to trauma for many German shareholders, resulting in lethargic stock performance over the past 18 years. The high dividend yield is also a result of this crash, with management trying to please the remaining stock owners. Since DT is a German symbol of the dot-com bubble, there might be a chance that the stock is simply not reacting to the current, positive news.
* Deutsche Telekom has a high net debt of 127.4 bn. $/107.1 bn. € (2020). However, the recurring cash flow is high, covering roughly 22.2% of its debt. The interest payments are fully covered by the profit (3.1x coverage).
* Currently, 14.5% of all shares are owned by the German government which might hamper potential positive share price developments. However, German economics minister Peter Altmeier is considering reducing the German participation (January 2021). Other privatization cases show a positive stock price effect.

**Summary:**

Based on all information available, I believe that the upside potential overweighs possible downsides. Even a conservative estimate of 24,40$/20,50€ target stock price reflects a 27% price premium. I personally believe that a **fair estimate based on financial analysis would be 44.64$/37,53€, resulting in a 132% stock price performance**.

**IMPORTANT EDIT AT POINT IV. SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!**

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

Edit3: I just refreshed the options page 3 times within a few seconds and there are more and more options coming in every second. Someone wants this to be much much bigger than we anticipated.

Edit4: I am gonna update all the numbers later. There is literally no point, because the call volume keeps increasing every few seconds at the moment.

This might sound stupid or crazy, because I am just a crayon eating dipshit. But here is what I think just happend. No financial advice, just a theory, bla bla bla.

**TL;DR** I think the Hedgefunds that want to fuck Shitadel &amp; Friends just caused this drop by selling a large amount of shares, in order to trigger the SSR and to load up some shares and options with a lower base price / premium.

I. In order to trigger the SSR, the price had to drop to $222.21.

📷

I will add the official NYSE confirmation of the SSR trigger, as soon as they update the SSR list. (01:22AM TMRW)

II. The price rose steadily with more and more options becoming ITM. Before the real Gamma Squeeze starts, they want to make sure, that Shitadel &amp; Friends can't short GME tomorrow.

📷

III. While GME dropped down to $172 (from $340, holy shit), almost all Stocks in my Portfolio went red and looked the same. I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.

**Edit: (7:52PM)** Seems like a was right with this ""I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.""

IV. I'll have to wait and look at the Open Interest and Volume for Options in the evening and tomorrow. But someone loaded up on a shit load of $800 Calls for this friday. There was a volume of 24,244 Calls and there is an open interest of about 22,000.

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

(Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!. This shit is about to explode tomorrow, because we were able to reach those prices without a Squeeze today! This confirms me in my theory, that someoneTM just watched and saw, that retail can be trusted. **(Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET)**

V. Why trigger it now and not at opening? That's just pure speculation, but maybe they wanted to see, if people hold and buy the small dips today. People did and that gave them the cofirmation, that there won't be huge sell offs when this Rocket launches. (See picture @ point II)

**My theory of what is about to happen**: As I am writing this, the price currently sits at $205. **If it starts to rise really really fast again, we might just see the start of the Gamma Squeeze.** Trading will get halted multiple times, don't be scared! If you just bought this dip: Congratulations, future millionaire!

**Will it start today? I don't think so, but it's possible!** We **could** see a rise in price today and tomorrow GME will moon, because the SSR rule\* is in place. I think we will close at about $250 - $ 280 and tomorrow we'll go to the moon before the Short Squeeze.

\*What is the SSR Rule? The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after. People also bought every dip, making it look like there is no way out for Shitadel &amp; Friends now.",What was this huge GEEE EMMM EEEE Drop?
