Last year, EROS was a top Bollywood media streaming company that merged with STX films, the creator of movies like Greenland and the foreigner.  Since the initial merger, the price crashed to 2 and has been hovering ever since, as institutions have been loading up.  Despite Greenland becoming a blockbuster hit, the price hasn't changed much in last few weeks but the institutional ownership seems to be growing continuously.
