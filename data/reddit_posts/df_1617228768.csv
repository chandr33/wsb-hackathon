28,mhhj5q,"# Precursor:  Note I have this flaired as ""discussion"".  It means just that.  This is really more of a ghetto ass megathread to talk about infinite money plays to avoid having to actually work the jobs spending the infinite money.  Add your 2 cents.

# 

Hello, Vault dweller!  I see you're here because you watched a speech from Sleepy about spending 2 trillion dollars on infrastructure, and you want to turn that into tendies.  I happen to have the flow chart for his plan in front of me, and am happy to walk you through on how you could theoretically play this on the market so you can stop being a cog in the machine and get off the hamster wheel, which is exactly what these types of bills aim to prevent you from doing because they need your blood.  Keep in mind that this discussion is based solely on the odd belief that a bunch of other politicians are going to come together and agree to spend all this money, so this is pretty much theorycraft.

&amp;#x200B;

# First, we have 620 billion for transportation, of which 115bln will be for the shit we drive on (freeways, bridges, etc.) and 20,000 miles of road.

&amp;#x200B;

**Likelihood of passing:  Actually fairly high as a line item.**  It's been proven time and again that there's no better stimulus to a faltering economy (even if it's faltering as a result of us shooting ourselves in the foot then crying about a crime) than a large public works project.  And this is one of those things everybody can get behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Your plays here are going to be industrials like **$CAT**, who will make the bulldozers, **$CMI** (or **$CUM** for you Europoors), who will make the engines, and even **$X**, who will sell a lot of steel.  Also don't sdleep on **$DE**, who doesn't make the construction equipment, but still has products that stand to benefit from large public works projects.  Of these, **$CAT** is by far the strongest play here, and I've been talking them up for a while now.  But don't sleep on plays like **$NUE**, which has a lot of room to run, and **$ETN**, a Boomer stonk that is near its highs, but will not only come to the trough for a lot of integration contracts, but recently bought up an EV charging company.  There's an outfit out there called **$BIPC** that most of you have probably never heard of, but don't be surprised to see this thing touch the triple digits if it looks like there's appetite to pass this spend on infrastructure.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimers:**  I'm long $CAT and $NUE in my fun money account, and $CMI in my managed portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

# Further within that 620bln is 85bln for public transportation

&amp;#x200B;

This one is harder to peg, because Sleepy still thinks horses and carriages are a thing.  But he seems to want to divert most of that money towards rail, and then send what's left to individual metropoli to enhance their public transport sector.  The former is easy - invest in steel, **$CSX**, and for a stealthy Boomer play, **$PCAR**.  The latter is trickier.  Sleepy made much ado about clean energy, but you have to read between the lines to find the companies that stand to benefit from this.  Your surefire winners in this space are going to be **$QS** and **$PLUG**, and **$CHPT**.  **$FCEL** has a seat at this table, as well.  Maybe an argument could be made for **BLDP**, and I'm sure there are a billion others - feel free to discuss below.  A stealth play with a LOT of runway as a result of a recent beatdown will be **$WKHS** and, if you think this is going to pass, you should absolutely buy some.  But, dear reader, I posit to you a better stealth play, courtesy of the Los Angeles public transit authority (and, if you're a longtime reader, you'll know I've been talking this one up for quite some time):  **$CLNE**.  Renewable nat gas to power any system that needs better capabilities than electric can provide and with a lower curve towards adoption.  There are going to be a lot of companies fighting over who gets to make the bus or the battery, but relatively few companies are in the running for who's going to provide the energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimers:**  Long $PLUG, $WKHS, and $CLNE.  

# 174bln in EV tax credits

**Likelihood of passing:** I'm actually not optimistic.  There are reasons there are limits to the tax credits given out, and it will be easy for fiscal conservatives to state that it's not fair that Joe the Plumber has to subsidize NrdRage's $100,000 sports sedan just because it uses grid energy.  You can get bylines and votes by speaking out against this.  (And, to be fair, I think it's stupid that I can get the taxpayers to help pay for my toys - but I absolutely make you do it if it's allowed).

\-Aka ""Elon once again has convinced the government to hand him stacks of taxpayer money"".  **$TSLA** is the far and away winner here in the short term.  But if this happens, expect **$VWAGY** and **$F** to race to get their hands on that cash.  And don't sleep on **Lewcid Motors** here.

\-500,000 charging stations by 2030 is the stated goal.   **$BLNK** and **$CHPT** are your obvious plays here, but there's a little known company called **Beam Global** running around out there (you'll have to find the ticker symbol on your own because reasons) that, if this line item gets passed, you can expect to be able to speak about freely here.  They would be a tricky play, because the moment their shit started going parabolic, they would dilute (don't say I didn't warn you!), but there's money to be made there if this becomes a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimers:**  At any given point, I can be in almost any of these.

&amp;#x200B;

# 180bln to upgrade labs and research facilities at colleges and government campuses

&amp;#x200B;

**Likelihood of passing:**  Incredibly low, at least at these numbers.  The fact that Sleepy wants to divert some of this money in his INFRASTRUCTURE plan that have nothing to do with INFRASTRUCTURE (including 30 billion dollars to ""address gender and racial inequality"") basically signals this line item is being included as a negotiating chip to give up in order to win a vote or two.

&amp;#x200B;

The one (and ONLY) interesting play I see here from this that could get some bipartisan support comes in the form of a stonk I talked about a few weeks ago, and would bigly benefit from any spend in this space to upgrade facilities:  **$BE.**  The research labs at places like Cal Tech have been relying entirely upon **$BE's** servers for years now, thanks to California's bullshit grid, and are basically a proof of function for every other lab and facility in the country that doesn't want to rely on a severely outdated grid to provide reliable power.  Given that one of the only things about this proposal that everybody is going to get behind is the need to update our power infrastructure, don't be surprised to see a fairly good chunk of money get carved out for the purposes of making research facilities grid independent.

**Disclaimer:**  Long $BE and was actually a seed investor for just this reason

&amp;#x200B;

# 300bln for manufacturing

**Likelihood of passing:**  For most of it?  Not a fucking chance.   They want to give 50bln to the National Science Foundation, 50bln to the Department of Commerce, and 50bln to studies.  There's no way.  But tucked away in here is something interesting:  50bln in incentives to semiconductor companies to build fab infrastructure.  The lobbyists for everybody from the automakers to the defense industry right to the gaming hardware companies will want to buy votes for that.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of interesting plays here, and you should absolutely read my DD on commodity semiconductors for a much more in depth talk about that and why only certain ones should be looked at for this play.  What I'll lead with is this:  There are reasons why the smart money has been absolutely PILING IN to commodity chip companies the last week.  Matter of fact**, $MU** just crossed $90 and is now worth more than **$AMD** as of this afternoon.  $ON is still my far-and-away best in breed, and that thing has made a lot of us a ton of money.  **$INTC t**hreatens to build a fab plant in Arizona every couple of years and never does, but if the government gave them cash, that might tip them over the edge.  **$AMAT** is a good sneaky play and, if you can afford it, **$LRCX** is going to get a cut of that.  The TL:DR here is you should definitely have semis in your portfolio, but not Theta Semiconductor **$TSM.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Position Disclaimers:**  Long $AMD, $ON, $NVDA

&amp;#x200B;

# 120bln for electrical grid improvements

**Likelihood of passing:**  Let's be honest, this will get kicked down the road again.  A lot of this money is actually in the form of tax credits to entice companies to move to renewable energy generation and storage.  If any of this money gets doled out, expect **$TSLA** and **$BE** to receive a large amount of this money, as well as **$ETN** as the leader in how to integrate these various systems.  BUT, if it happens, a great stealth play is going to be **$PWR**.  If by some miracle this money is allocated, don't be surprised to see these dudes in the 120's just off froth.

&amp;#x200B;

Long $TSLA and $BE

# Unknown $$$ to replace lead pipes for clean water

**Likelihood of passing:**  Almost nil.  That's a chopping block item that will get passed down to local municipalities to deal with (or, more accurately, not).  Further, I've got no expertise in the clean water space, so have no companies to recommend other than the requisite heavy machinery needed to dig, trench, and replace (so **$CAT** and, to a lesser extent**, $DE**).  If anybody has expertise here, please speak up and if you make a compelling case, I'll copy-pasta you into this space and give you the credit for the knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

# 100bln for broadband infrastructure

&amp;#x200B;

**Likelihood of passing:**  Oh, you can bet every lobbyist affected from **$LUMN** to **$CSMCA** to **$TMUS** (thanks to buying Sprint's trunks) will be buying those votes.  Getting paid for the privilege to gouge the consumer?  They'll be all about this.  But more importantly, this again talks about the importance of having a semiconductor in your portfolio, because all the 5G rollout as a result of this will fall directly to these guys.  See above for my thoughts on semis.

**Position Disclaimers:**  Pretty sure I'm not in any of the highlighted companies; see above for the semis.

# 300bln to build affordable homes, public housing, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Likelihood of passing:**  Never in a million years.  Not even worth discussing.  Same goes for the 100bln to go to schools and childcare facilities.  And ESPECIALLY the 500bln to pay for disabled/elder care, which is a pure pork item.  If you're going to play this fairy tale, **$URI** and a company called **$TEX** (they make the Genie lifts) would be profitable

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of his plan centers around taxes.  He specifically called $AMZN to the mat.  You know what Wall Street thinks about taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

All my love,

&amp;#x200B;

69,mhi0wy,"Coursera ($COUR) IPOd today. I have been waiting for this one to see how it did.

My hypothesis has been that it would either tank day 1, or show steady (not rocket ship) growth.

Well, the results are in for day 1 and it didn‚Äôt tank. It is up over 30%. I expect some profit taking tomorrow from people who wanted a quick gain (and got it!) and then a climb back up again in the short and long term.

I went ahead and bought 10 shares this evening and will double down if it dips tomorrow.

I have personally used them for a certification. Led to a $10K raise at work as a direct result. Also shared on my LinkedIn profile which was a nice touch or recruiting to potential new jobs.

My company is now using them for training. These guys are light years ahead in an industry that is full of decade(s) old technology that never got updated.

The pandemic has shut down all kinds of seminars and workshops and corporations are moving training budgets from expensive in-person conferences with hotel and airfare and meal costs, into professional grade training such as Coursera that associates can do from the office (or home).

I think this is going to grow and continue growing as companies realize how much more efficient this approach is than flying people all over the world for 3 days workshops.

76,mhi3av,"I‚Äôve been collecting data from major social networks - companies‚Äô pages on FB, Twitter, Instagram, LI for 2 months. Then the collected data was aggregated into a historical perspective and I discovered 5 companies that are most actively growing in the number of their followers in the media.

This is a continuation of a series of posts related to the indirect metrics of public companies, here are the rest - [traffic‚Äôs growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mceny3/ive_analyzed_the_websites_of_the_top_3000_public/), [number of employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md7y4m/ive_been_analyzing_the_data_on_employee_growth/), [hiring dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mfwjwe/ive_analyzed_job_openings_for_the_top_3k_public/). Why am I doing this? *I believe that indirect companies' metrics are related to their stock price.* When more historical data accumulates, I will try to find a statistical correlation between the indirect indicators of the company's performance (traffic, employees, ratings from employees, behavior in social networks) with its stock price and publish a post with the results of my whole research.  
Below you can find a list of the top 5 companies based on audience growth, hope this info will bring some value:

**1. Algorand ($ALGO) - total audience growth +36% in 3 weeks.** Absolute leader in audience growth among 3000 companies.

A few weeks ago i stumbled upon this company which excavates metals in Quebec, at the moment they are drilling sample holes in their soil to figure out where exactly they wish to start excavating. Yesterday they posted their drilling results so far which were quite promising.

Another interesting thing about this company is its ticker, i have absolutely no idea who gave them the permission to list stocks under that name, eitherway, it is in my opinion an interesting way to attract investors. As of now nearly 23% of their shares are held by institutions

May I present to you Pacific Gas &amp; Electric; the ultimate infrastructure play. 


$PCG checks not one but two major boxes of the plan that Biden laid out today in his speech. 

1: Electric Vehicle infrastructure

Most of this is already laid out in this DD
The TLDR is that PG&amp;E has a deal with Tesla to promote EV in the Bay area. The company is ALREADY working to improve the EV infrastructure in Northern California, which is home to the largest EV vehicle fleet in the country. ~20% of the EV vehicles in the US


2. Power-line improvements

Now THIS is the part I‚Äôm most excited about for PCG. In Bidens speech he directly states ‚ÄúThe American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. Protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super-storms, floods, wildfires, droughts year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúMy American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work, hundreds of thousands of people to work. Line workers, electricians, and laborers laying thousands of miles of transmission line, building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid‚Äù

PG&amp;E, for the last decade, has been NOTORIOUS for their powerline failures and antiquated systems. In fact, the debacle of their power lines starting numerous wildfires in the PNW is the reason for their recent fall from grace starting in 2018. This share used to trade at 70$ before their fall due to settlements. Given the last years fire season, which was the worst EVER on record, there is no doubt in my mind that a huge portion of the infrastructure plan will go towards mitigating the risks of fire in the PNW, and PG&amp;E will get huge amounts of funding to improve their utility infrastructure. The debacle has left the shares in shambles, which are now trading at 11.80 as of this DD

TLDR: This company has been held down by its past mishaps, is too big to fail, and is ripe to benefit from the infrastructure bill.

Cons:
-settlements for fires will bankrupt the company again
-new fires could lead to new settlements
-people fucking hate PG&amp;E as a company. They are not loved


Cheers ya‚Äôll and GL in the casino
