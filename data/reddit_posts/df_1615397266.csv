I think this squeeze may be following the same trend that Volkswagen did. If I'm right, it means there may be a few false peaks ahead before the real infinite squeeze begins. The VW squeeze was triggered by Porsche first acquiring 30% of VW and then making a bid for +50% ownership. This is mostly a guess but I think the first spike in GME matches the first spike in VOWs price which was followed by a couple false peaks including a really big one. I think the first peak in GME was only a result of scaring the hedgies enough that they had to take action, I don't think retail actually controlled enough shares at that point to cause a lot of volatility in the market. It was probably also the point when a lot of big players entered the game betting against the shorts. When the price dropped to &lt;$50 I think that is where we found the retail level of support that we were able to create by buying and holding. I think the current bull run has been caused by a few factors, the biggest being other funds betting against the shorts and then followed up by retail slowly piling back on as the price stabilized and then began charging up. We're reaching a point where retail interest combined with bigger players buying up large chunks is going to start causing a lot of volatility so my theory is that we are about to see some MEGA price swings and a paper hand holocaust followed by the Mother of all Short Squeezes. Shit is different from VW this time around because we lack the element of surprise that Porsche had but we have support from multiple big players and an army of retarded apes. I can only assume that this time around is going to be so bananas that it'll make the VW squeeze seem like a perfectly executed ballet number.

TLDR; strap in and hold on to your hairy ape butts with your diamond hands because this bull's about to start bucking. Don't sell before the moon and buy the mega dip that's going to happen right before blast off.",Theory: Turbulence Ahead,1.0,1615397376,ThorAlmighty

74,m232hx,"I am pleading for help here, please. You all are experts and I can't even call myself a rookie - I'm a disaster. We'd saved $120K over years to send our son to college next year. I thought I'll make some extra money so he doesn't have to take a loan. 

Last year, I first invested 20K in NWARF (Norwegian Airlines) as it was going up. Of course I bought them at peak and it never hit that range ever again. 

To redeem that money, I invested $100K in GNUS (of course I am fucking genius) when it was going to the moon, I guess? Within minutes it went from $10 $6.5 and which point I sold it and got $65K back. 

Set back with $55K, I started following r/wallstreetbets and by the time I caught up, GME was at an all-time high, so I invested all in BB and NOK. The next day the Robinhood fiasco started and the numbers are for you all to see. My husband doesn't know about this but will blow up his shit when he files taxes. 

Please please please guide me step by step in how I can redeem this money, if ever at all? I blew up our life's savings -- that too the money for our son's education and can't see any road to recovery. I am down $85K! Please provide guidance.
