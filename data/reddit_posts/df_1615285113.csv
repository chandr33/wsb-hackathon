Smooth brain thoughts incoming.

I was thinking about how the government could bailout Melvin and whoever else needs it if the stock price indeed rockets. And then I thought about how any US citizen who sold at a profit would likely have to pay fairly large taxes on the sale.  If hundreds of billions of dollars are transferred to a bunch of individuals, wouldn't the government stand to also get a significantly higher boost in tax revenue next year? Why wouldn't regulators and congresspeople want us to win?

Yes, I realize there are plenty of banks in the pockets of Congress, and maybe I just have an overly rosy-colored view of the situation, but if someone who is much smarter could explain this or discuss this, I'd be curious of your thoughts.

# What is priced in FED Land ? 

Nearly a full hike in EOY 22 | 2.3 % Average fed funds over next 30 years | 10/2 at 143 bps which is a level last seen in Dec 2016 which is the peak of the Trump era.  
I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

**YELLEN**   
It would take 2 years at this rate to get back to pre covid u6 (puts us on March 23)

**GS** WITH INFRA /!\\   
the simulation implies 7% Q4/Q4 GDP growth in 2021, a decline in the unemployment rate to 3.7% in 2021Q4 and 3% by 2023Q4, a pickup in core inflation to 2.2% by 2023, and one to two rate hikes in 2023 under our interpretation of the Fed’s new framework. We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

**MS**   
While inflation in the reopening-sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient,a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021 – led by shelter inflation,healthcare services,and a multi-quarter passthrough of dollar weakness into goods. The sustainable inflation impulse intensifies in 2022as cyclically sensitive inflation components start to dominate – based on a tightening labor market and robust levels of demand. Core PCE to peak at 2.3 on DEC 22 !!!!*that TIPS-based breakeven inflation, based on CPI inflation measures, could move considerably higher and still be consistent with a PCE inflation outcome modestly above the 2% target.”*

**My own Conclusion** If you assume no infra or an infra bill that is close to entirely paid for via additional taxes and has a low multiplier we are definitely slightly above fair value in terms of rates. The Fed into FOMC next week WILL not assume an infra bill or its implications within the SEP thus in this case it is still possible to have a SEP that shows **no HIKE in 2023** So I cannot help but be bullish duration (&amp; implications, see title) into FOMC March 16 and Auctions March 11 However - **Progress on infra / Data points indicating or suggesting faster path to min u6 will be hawkish EuroDollars (&amp; implications)**   
I DO Believe there will be progress on an infra bill that will be generally expansionary in the end - thus the real trend is still an increase in real rates / ED and the implications that come with it : \* Gold down / \* TXN down / \* Dollar up vs EUR,CHF,Yen / \*NQ valuation down / \*Banks up / \*Value &gt; Growth / But there should be a respite as we’ve already had strong progress in this direction and   
a) we will get a FED that, by ignoring the infra bill, will be able to push back VERY strongly through the SEP   
b) We are hearing stories of Manchin refusing to use fillibuster (which would make the infra bill A LOT Less exciting)   
How to trade this then ? Clearly, the real solution is to sell puts on NQ expiring soon to buy puts expiring later (apply that to all the other asset classes)

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm???

I wanted to know just how many of you have a plan in terms of what you will be doing with your GME gains, I have heard others say that AMC will be next but I have heard many others basically saying they will splurge on something like a new house, pay off student debt etc. I wanted to know what is WSB doing with their gains?   


I am buying some blue chips stocks and paying off portions of my student loans. After the covid crisis began and my place of employment closed down I have become am obsessed with trying to find ways to make money in the most time efficient way possible for after Covid is finally over. (God willing by Summer) I want to be able to have a secondary income in case I am ever in this situation again where I am jobless I will have a way to make ends meat or at least have a back up source of income without having to liquidate all my assets to hold myself over. While this is not financial advice I do hope you all take a a good portion of your gains and have that money work for you.",After GME is fully squeezed?,1.0,1615286962,Royale_Blue_

90,m141v5,"You are just a greedy ape.

It's hyper cringe to see plain old greed getting prettified by a fake ""righteousness"" notion.

Sure, like last time, a tiny subset of you that actually made money donated a few Nintendo Switches here and there to get some internet praise.

But remember, you are not sticking it to any ""hedgies"". You are making money alongside those ""hedgies"" you so hate.

Try and cover for your debts in this run at the very least.

Gamble what you can afford to lose, it's easy to get caught up in the euphoria.

Each table is assigned one of rows of 65inch large screen monitors along the wall. Other monitors along the wall can also show sports events, live gaming events.  Serve drinks, nachos, fries, chicken wings.  Let people demo games or play their favorites.  Sell merchandise similar to Apple where inventory is hidden.
