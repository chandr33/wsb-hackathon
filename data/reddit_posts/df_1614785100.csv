52,lwwkiz,"Guys, this rocket has been like the SpaceX Boosters, they get close to space but always touch back down to earth... It's capped... No moon for apes...

Just kidding, you pussy ass paper handed bitch, how dare you fucking agree with my statement!?!?!

Guys, we are on a mission... No space mission has taken less than a month to plan, like ever. These things take time. What is so beautiful to me is how a group of average people have banded together, Wall street is SCARED of us. We did not ""Manipulate the market"", we rallied for a common cause, some of us lost money, some gained. You see the problem is that, the government has always been scared of us, because like ants, there is strength in numbers... 

Our Autist asses are making HISTORY... One day when Elon Musks Grandkids are studying at Harvard school of Business they'll be talking about the great movement on Wall street from 2021, DFV will be there, Wallstreetbets will be there, And each and every single one of you, will have partaken in a true moment in History.

This could not have been accomplished without you smooth brained apes. Let's not stop here, Wallstreet is scared, The Hedgies are getting their asses chewed by the Wall and Old Money.

A bright young man once said - I like the stock... Let's show these graduate mofos what a bunch of Apes can do. Grab your bananas boys, We're taking off amd We're never coming back home 🚀🦍🍌🌌

TLDR: Not financial advice, I like the stock, Making History, Wall street scared, Apes together strong, Something about space and rockets, Limit 1 banana per carry-on","Serious thing about $GME, you don't understand what's going on here...",0.87,1614785511,IfItsBrokenFixIt

I've been on this sub off and on for about 5 years. My first exposure was when people were hyping AMD, and by the time I finished my own DD, stock was up 30% and I decided not to buy. To clarify that was when the price was low single digits and I'd still have made 35x. I've been lurking for a while, MSFT 200 wasn't a winner, nor all those SPY puts. But GME is legit.  

I didn't get into GME in Jan, but I did buy in Feb. This stock isn't about intrinsic value, it's about the short squeeze. Every analyst has it as a short term buy, they see it happening too. 

I am notoriously paper handed, but I can't see myself selling anything below $420.69 a share here. We are going to hit it. I might have my expectations short of the moon, but it doesn't take a genius to see this stock as a buy and hold right now.",Old School Mentality... still holding GME.
