0,m1kqsn,"5 days ago I posted DD on Academy Sports, where I believe that its earnings report this month will be a catalyst for a short squeeze. I didn't post this DD as an experiment in manipulation but it ended up being just that. My first two attempts to post were unsuccessful, for my third I added in a GME thesis based on RKT gains and reinvestment. Once I put in GME the post went through successfully. The post then received 118 likes and 10 awards. All of the awards came from accounts with ""double names"" e.g. rujwal\_rujwal, ujjwal\_ujjwal. These accounts were formed the same day and are now deactivated. I intend to retry this experiment, again with fire ASO data and graphs both with and without a GME mention.

My first attempt to post THIS very post, with a different title, was also auto mod removed ""to keep the community true to its purpose.""

My concern is that, to the opposite of what many on the forum believe, that bots are being used to pump GME. One of the top posts currently is a DD stating that short interest has increased to 1000% that completely misunderstands almost everything it uses as a data point. It's a fact that GME is the most heavily shorted stock, it's also a fact that liking a stock and buying it wouldn't lead to prosecution for participating in a pump and dump. But these factually incorrect, and lengthy posts, pumping GME recently absolutely fall within 77q and 10b-5. I believe tons of retail investors will make money on GME, and it is as good a speculative play as any, but I have a feeling that this time around there will be even more retail bag holders. There is absolutely a pump and dump scheme revolving around GME and WSB. Try it yourself, post a GME DD and look at the awards/likes.

Getting off of the GME pump thesis, and sounding too close to a schizophrenic for my liking, there appears to be institutional manipulation of ASO. ASO is currently the third most shorted stock and had a blow out last earnings and looks to do even better when it reports this month. The only OTM options for near term are $25, $30 and $35. If you look at Friday's close you will see that it closed just under $25 for purposes of options expiry, despite being above the prior two days, and then returned above just after market close. Yesterday saw it rise over 10%, which was immediately reversed today on much less volume. I have no doubt that it will close under $25 again this week despite any wild rides on the way there. You can also see something similar happening almost every morning, with a high volume buy up and then less volume carrying it down throughout the day.",ASO and GME to the moon!,1.0,1615336248,USAG1748

Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht

Sup fuckers. Tax season is coming up and if you're like me you probably have a 1099 that's at least 100 pages long from all the shitty trades you've made this year. For those of you that use TurboTax, you can just import that fucker, but for the rest of you, you were shit out of luck, until now. I took an hour out of my precious day to write a shitty python script that parses your trade data out of Robinhood's 1099 into an excel sheet. This may or may not help your poor accountant.

Disclaimer: this script probably won't work for every 1099 b/c I wrote it based off what was on my 1099. This script also cuts off a bit of the 'additional information' section sometimes b/c I figured no one cares about that shit anyway and I couldn't be bothered to fix it.

This is also a command line script and there is no GUI so if you can't figure it out too bad.

Anyway here's the GitHub link. I don't think it's too hard to use. Just install python and run this bad boy.

28,m1kvmx,"I have created a quick table using the open interest at each strike price for call options to determine the likely cost of fulfilling these call options if they become ITM and are executed.

Some caveats:

- I only compiled options expiring this week and next week.
- I assume that all options already ITM have already been fully hedged.
- This isn't accurate, but I assume that options not ITM will be hedged at an average price between the last strike and the next. Many options are likely partially or fully hedged already.
- This is purely looking at option chains, and has nothing to do with the short squeeze.

The price just crossed the $250 strike in after-hours. That means in just the next two weeks, 5,542 more calls are ITM costing about $138M to fulfill. 

When we hit $300, a total of 1.9M shares are due to ITM calls, with an estimated total cost of $541M.

At $400, there will be 3.7M shares due to ITM calls, with an estimated cost of $1.2B.

At $500, it's 5.2M shares costing a total of $1.9B.

At $600, it's 6.2M shares costing a total of $2.5B.

At $700, it's 6.7M shares costing a total of $2.8B.

Here's where it gets really juicy. At $800, the total shares needing to be fulfilled jumps from 6.7M to 11.8M, costing a total of nearly $6.9B.

Now, this is very rough math and market makers hedge gradually based on gamma. However, with such a large open interest and potential cost for $800 call options, as that strike becomes more of a possibility they will need to start buying shares quicker and quicker to hedge the risk. This is likely to cause a gamma squeeze.

WHILE THAT IS HAPPENING, every single short position will become out of the money and be upside down. The highest short position would be at a price of $483, so before we even get to $500 every single short will be upside down.

A short and gamma squeeze could possibly happen at the same time, and I have no idea what kind of chaos that would create. Keep in mind that market makers alone need to purchase almost 12,000,000 shares which is probably more than the total number of shares in circulation (not being held by institutions and retards).

Okay, so I've been here since early January.

I've watched since a few days before the first spike, I invested because I like the stock, and I invested high at the time \~$300 a share.

I watched GME climb, I watched the switch get flipped and I watched it fall to discounted rates. I bought more. I bought more recently, knowing the war was not yet over. We had won, but they had yet to admit defeat. I held, I bought the dip, the cycle repeated.

A lot of us did.

I've been here, reading every post in ""Hot"" first, then every post in ""New"" after, then every post in ""Controversial"" after that.. Then jumping sub Reddits to see what's going on with WSB (and if I'm feeling cheeky GME\_Meltdown lol) .. The point is, in terms of GME alone, I've read a \*LOT\*.

This topic today is something I've seen people touch on, but in reality is the one defining principle you apes all need to remember going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# ""0 Risk = 0 Fucks."" - The method to attaining true 💎🙌

&amp;#x200B;

[We will still have YOLOs, people who have plenty of disposable income, and just smooth brained apes. But hear me out.](https://preview.redd.it/gd29hzykj3m61.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=673e9cb15ba2dcc38002f7084377e7e9112062a6)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Let me paint a picture of why this is important.*

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say Billy the Ape works a middle class job, earns say 50k a year.. supports a family, has debts, and is average in the financial sense. (Giant 💎 nuts though)

Billy sees what's happening and scrapes together life savings, using all of his available cash to get as many 🍌 🍌 🍌 as Billy can afford.

Now, imagine Billy being here in January when the first spray of ape shit hit the fan and he loses upwards of 80% of his 🍌..

Being the ""predatory"" 🦍 Billy is, he HODLs strong.. and in fact uses what he can from his pay to even average down his position and buy more 🍌 🍌 . Smart Ape.

Still.... at the back of his mind, the mountains of FUD, and the potential unknown risks involved in interstellar 🚀 travel still exist.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**It does in every ape. This is normal.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How does one successfully remove all of this risk? - I will tell you. Soon Ape. Keep reading. Good ape.

&amp;#x200B;

[Your Ape family - be it your immediate family, others around you who you support.. \*AND\* each of you here.](https://preview.redd.it/e3ypp6wnj3m61.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e2b849ce8167ae07348cf5383d3bba64e9d61c)

&amp;#x200B;

Each ape is an individual, each ape has their own family of apes to provide for. But each ape also trusts other apes in this whole saga.. with good reason. We have proven our staunch support, we like the stock. And every sign we see (confirmation bias or not) leads us to believe our DD, and that of others is spot on. So what comes next?

The BIGGEST test of 💎🙌 comes at 10k, 100k, 500k .. $1mil+

*It's easy to hold when you have nothing left to lose - (Sitting at -80% in the red, ""Fuck them, I ain't leaving!)*

*It's easy to hold when you've broke even - (Only up from here right?)*

*It's easy to hold when you're double your money - (Look at me guys, I'm a mini-DFV, to the moon!!* 🚀🚀🚀)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# It's NOT going to be easy to hold at 10x or 20x or 100x your investment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[How you WILL feel holding all those unrealised tendies.](https://preview.redd.it/naek7uprj3m61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19f45c618806b1e5d96e597e64d00f0665665c8e)

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, each ape that hasn't been exposed to this kind of cash before, will be Atlas, you must be ready to shoulder the weight of the world as it if it depends on you.

There are already posts about what people will do, how they are calculating their earnings from holding etc. This is great, and apes are excited which they should be.

But, when the price continues to roll higher, and Apes start seeing chunks of money they've never once held in their accounts before, they will consider 📄🙌 and taking their ""win"" and going quite and spitefully watching as the show goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

# Do not be that ape.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said..... The one true tactic to forming those diamond hands we all talk about is:

&amp;#x200B;

# COVER YOUR INITIAL FUCKING INVESTMENT! 💎🙌

&amp;#x200B;

It's really that simple.

&amp;#x200B;

I am \*NOT\* telling you to give up your 🍌's --- This is the \*REASON\* this is happening. I'm not going into the DD, but you know the situation with the shorts and there's posts even as recent as \*TODAY\* suggesting that they just keep digging deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

This is fkn mint for apes.

&amp;#x200B;

But, there will come a price point - Where you can recoup your initial investment for relatively few 🍌.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you shout ""REEEEE SHILL"" --- No, I will hold a share or two until the very end and most likely find some way to print it and put it on a wall in my girlfriends boyfriends mansion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**But.. Here's an example:**

&amp;#x200B;

Billy the Ape buy 50 🍌 @ 150 = $7500

Billy HODLS 🍌 - Price Rises.

🍌 rises to $1k - Billy releases 8 Bananas.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Billy retains 42 🍌 **- AT ZERO FUCKING COST. ZERO. BILLY NOW HAS HIS CASH AND 42 FUCKING BANANAS**

&amp;#x200B;

Billy waits patiently, even buys some more 🍌if there's a dip (spoiler alert, there will be) - But in general Billy sits and watches his FREE money, make MORE free money!

&amp;#x200B;

Billy is a smart 🦍

&amp;#x200B;

(This is also down to personal circumstances - Only your ape brain knows how bigger risk you took on this, so adjust the example and cover price accordingly - Not advice. Fact.)

And now..

# Billy no longer has any RISK, or any FEAR of losing what was already his.

# This empowers Billy.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""BILLY CAN'T LOSE NOW, ONLY WIN, QUESTION IS \\""WIN HOW MUCH?\\"" 💎🙌](https://preview.redd.it/5ry5kmoak3m61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f901b6eb6ac34d5d94916f4a293b84773c28c4a0)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Chew a few more crayons, take a break, come back. There's more to this. I'll wait.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now my brother, who I recently told about GME, laughed at me. Thought I was wearing a tin foil hat. In fact a few people did.

They have all got their own 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 now. Some got a lot, others got 1 🍌 - It all counts.

If you can't talk the DD to people, share the Reddit, or even just some of the epic posts that have been done.

Media is going to report on this less and less as we climb until they can't ignore it.

You're \*IN\* the ape camp, you see each others ideas and DD on the daily.

95% of the population still don't... or if they did, decided they don't want to know.

Share the ideas with those you know, who stand to benefit from it. @$250 it's still a bargain.

Papa Cohen will knock this out of the park. Trust.

# Flash forward a few weeks or months... (Well.. it could still be sooner, but let's pace ourselves. Don't $CUM to soon! More apes will want in on this orgy.)

&amp;#x200B;

Stonk is up, volume is miniscule, and we are jumping not by $1 or $2 in a movement, but $10's and $100's in a movement.

This \*WILL\* happen.. when the squeeze begins it will move at a pace you will struggle to comprehend with your smooth brains. This is good. It means it's beginning. Read the DD's - The squeeze will not be squoze in a day. But you WILL know when it starts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 2: The End Game.

This part comes later... could be weeks, could be months. Do not limit yourself by time. You have now set yourself in a position where there is only profit, no risk. Do not look at the money going up and consider it a risk.

You never had these 🍌🍌 before all this, and this will be the one and only 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fkn moonshot you will get. With the world watching, the new rules to be imposed, and the serious boning that some of these HFs (Hi Melvin) are getting from Game Stop..

&amp;#x200B;

**Shit will change.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now it may change in favour of us little guys, I am optimistic it will. But never again, will we see such blatant manipulation in the market, the inaction of regulatory bodies, or a chance like this again.

&amp;#x200B;

""How does this smooth brained ape sell at the tippy top?""

Short Answer: YOU DON'T

Longer Answer: In theory, ""The Way"" will be to let a small portion of shares go at a time, never dump your full load in one go. People have spoken about TA and reading the graphs to know when this will start and end. It likely won't work .. so you're best off doing something like:

&amp;#x200B;

Billy Holds 42 🍌 (Risk Free bananas, the sweetest kind)

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 1k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 2k

Billy releases 1 🍌 @ 4k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 8k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 16k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 32k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 64k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 128k

Billy Releases 1 🍌 @ 256k

... You get Billys point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If every 🦍 is like Billy, this can go as far as you want it to.

&amp;#x200B;

# The power of compounding risk free 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And at this stage, Billy has made .. **\~ $511,000** profit from a $7500 outlay (which was already covered) and only used 9 🍌 ... Billy \*STILL\* has 33 🍌 left.... That's a fkn lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Billy hasn't dumped 42 🍌 @ 1 price, and watched it climb and felt like he missed out, he also didn't greatly affect the other apes as he did this.

&amp;#x200B;

Billy is again a smart 🦍

&amp;#x200B;

When you have 0 risk, and a solid idea in your smooth brain how you're going to play this...

&amp;#x200B;

Just enjoy the ride. You earned it 🦍

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when this hits 100k a share I'll be getting my first ever tattoo... You can bet your 🍌 on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Cover initial investment for small portion of 🍌 at unspecified amounts/times - retain rest and let go 1 🍌 at a fkn time. Simple. Not advice.

82,m1l4mr,"Ok retards. So I was one of the apes who bought GME during the first squeeze, and instead of holding or selling at the top, I sold and lost my life changing gains by selling at the absolute bottom of almost $40. So naturally this didn’t bode well with me, but I have a really really good idea.

So I have decided here and now that I will take out the biggest, juiciest, fattest loan and I’m gonna YOLO all of it on GME. Now I know what you’re thinking, I’m completely retarded, and you’re right, I definitely have a few extra chromosomes than the majority of you apes. But this plan is foolproof, I have no debt, I have good credit, and I simply don’t give a fuck because this literally can’t go tits up. 

I’ll either retire early or “retire early” if u catch my drift so it’s a win win either way. I’ll update you guys as soon as I can find the meatiest loan to yolo into GME and I’ll see you guys in my million dollar mansion and Tesla in a few weeks. Also if GME breaks 700 I’ll go into GameStop and buy every PS5 in stock and give away every single one of them.

TLDR: YOLO money I don’t own to become a multi millionaire 🚀 🚀🚀🚀",I’m about to make the biggest brain play,1.0,1615337383,beandon123

85,m1l5bn,"This is not a financial advice. I just like the stock. This stock is extremely undervalued. And soon will squeeze. 

1)the company made $3.5 billion in 2020 and currently valued at $15 billion. With a price to earning ratio of 4.3. While $rkt is valued at $55 billion, and they only made $197 billion in 2020, makes their price to earning ratio at 255!!! If UWMC will be $250 per share if it can even achieve half of the P/E ratio of $RKT, 

2)UWMC is extremely focused to advance their tech side. They have 800 employees working on their technology to make processing mortgages quick and easier for their customers. They will steal a lot of market share away from others.

3)they pay a 4.5% dividend. No growth stock is making positive earnings let alone paying a dividend. This stock checks all the boxes of a perfect investment.

4) their ceo is very aggressive and about this business. You will never hear a ceo as ambitious and honest at the same time. Listen to his interviews and earnings call, you will get very bullish.

5) short sellers are pounding this stock down for month. Short interest is almost 20% and there will be a squeeze of all squeezes.
