It threatened it works with a practice called fire &amp; rehire meaning the company wanted to rip up its employees employment contracts and rehire them on worse terms &amp; conditions. if the employees don't agree they will be fired. This company has now issued over 1000 of its with notice of their terminations meaning that 14th of April will be their last day of employment unless they agree. This is corporate greed at its worst and if this community has any ideas about how to fight back against this greed (short sell)  to show the little guys can win that would be amazing.
