2. APHA Earnings (April 13th) -Reasons to look forward to earnings, APHA will report positive earnings (which doesn’t happen often for a marijuana company)

* APHA has stabilized its expenses as revenue continues to grow -Sweetwater will be included for the first time on earnings and reports $200 million in revenue

3. Tilray Merger Vote (April 14th) -The vote going through will be huge for both companies as Irwin Simon will take over as the new CEO of the combined company that will trade under the ticker TLRY

* The merger will play to both companies strengths as APHA is a king of development and production, while suffers in size and distribution ability, TLRY who suffers from the ability to develop and produce has amazing distribution and size -The joint company will become the largest pot company in the world by revenue and should take over Canopy in market cap quickly -Both companies have recently been acquiring distribution contracts all over Europe, and in some countries are the only companies to have acquired said contracts.

4. Tilray Merger Date (4/20) -First off 4/20. -APHA is currently trading at a discount to TLRY when comparing the conversion of 0.8387 APHA to TLRY which creates an opportunity for Arbitrage.

My question is, what are the best sources for doing your DD? Some people do their DD by coming on WSB, understandably. But the people who BRING their DD to WSB are the real saving graces.

What’s your method into gathering your own DD? What websites/sources are the best for getting a read on the market? This is my smooth brained question!
