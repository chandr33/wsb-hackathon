(TL;DR at bottom) 

Earlier today, my mother received a call from my sister’s therapist saying she was legally obligated to inform her that my sister said “I might not be here next week,” suggesting that she intended on ending it all before her next visit. My dad confronted her about this and asked her why she said that. If she didn’t want to be here. If she didn’t want to live. Her response was a “no” to both questions. 

My mom got on the phone with one of the local hospitals and asked if it would be possible to admit my sister for treatment. I’m writing this, they’re driving her there. It’s almost midnight and I haven’t heard back from my parents. I tried finding the cost of treatment on the hospital’s site, but haven’t had any luck, so I tried getting a general idea by searching for the average cost of mental health treatments. According to the information I’m looking at on PubMed

&gt;&gt;Depression treatment, $6,990 for 8.4 days and $3,616 for 4.4 days, 

I realize that with some of the money you guys spend, this might not seem like a lot. However, my parents have had to borrow money from me to help them pay for things recently. My parents assure me they intend to pay me back, but it’s hard to think that nothing is up when months pass and they ask to borrow again without having paid back the original amount. They’ve also been emphasizing using as little water and electricity as possible since most of our past few bills had seen increases. Landlord also raised rent by about $200 from last time. 

I’m not sure how long my sister will be staying at the hospital, nor am I sure what specific treatment she’ll be receiving (best guess was depression). Although my parents pay taxes just like everyone else, government assistance has always been out of the question due to the fact that they are undocumented immigrants. This includes the three stimulus checks that have been sent out. 

So when—not if, but when—GME and AMC moon, I’ll be damn sure that those tendies go toward helping my sister and taking some weight off my parents’ shoulders. They’ve all been through hell and I want nothing more than to be able to help them. So then, fellow apes, I ask you to hold the line with me as we ride the rocket to the moon and beyond 🚀🚀

The sterile wrap is important, it’s mainly used in operating theatres to wrap up surgical instruments. Theatres are by a huge mile the money making part of a hospital. My hospitals stock will run out in two weeks, a nearby hospital has already nearly ran out and is restricting category 3 surgeries(non emergency &amp; elective things). Which is where a huge amount of money comes from. 

It’s going to force a lot of hospitals to look at other options, like rigid sterile containers which are reusable. A company called Aesculap makes these things, and they’re used globally too. 

Anyone heard of this? Or looking into how to make money from this? 

Multigate and Hayard are the companies I know that sell sterile wrap.

90,m61ybk,"Greetings fellow smooth Brian's, why don't you lay down on the floor and listen to the soothing words of my face hole.

Imagine if you will that the price of GameStop stock has risen from 300 to 743,000. 

• Along the course of that journey let's say 50% of us sold at $1,000. 

• Let's say another 25% sell at 10,000. 

• Let's say half of the remaining which is 12.5% sell at 100,000. 

• Let's say 6.25% sell at $350,000. 

• Now let's say 3% or so manage to sell near the peak at $743,000. 

• That means the remaining 3% or so decide to hold through the entire peak and sell on the downturn. Maybe some of them don't sell it all, I don't know. this is just hypothetical in order to describe the following:

The overall result is that very few people got maximum gains. In fact most people made about 10 to 20% of what everyone else did.

How can we change the math to be in everyone's favor a little more?

That's actually easier than you might believe. We can do it with simple six-sided dice.

Here's how it works. *Every time you want to sell* you have to       [roll](https://www.random.org/integers/) a die 3x and add the numbers together. If you roll below a five total, you sell 10% of your shares. If you roll below 10 but above 5 you sell 5%. If you roll 11 or higher you sell nothing. Then you must wait 24 hours to roll again.

Effectively what this will do is divide all shareholders into three groups everyday, randomly distributing tendies in a more stochastic and therefore equitable manner. It will also decelerate the falling action of the stock after its peak. Considering how many of us there are the math possibly may have to be tweaked a little, but essentially the idea is to put limiters on everyone's sales speed and artificially reduce volume to give more people maximum time to get out. 

Obviously there is a downside to this in the form of greedy people taking advantage of the slower decline to cash out ahead of everyone else. I think I'm fine with that. Some of us don't have much going for us. for some of us this will be the most money we've ever had in our lives. It's worth taking a look at the mechanics of this thing in order to ensure an orderly exit from the building so that fewer people are trampled in the rush later. When it comes to group action One Plus One is three, together stronger. 

Plus you can pretend you're battling Melvin and rolling damage, and you can post and tell us how your attacks went.

My parents invested with Melvin capital at the start of the pandemic. They were impressed by the aggressive nature of the hedge fund and its boasting of “taking the kill shot”. Their early gains on a down market with market retailers led them to believe Melvin were the smartest guys in the room, then their gains were wiped out by the greatest retail investor bluff call we’ll see in our lifetime. We’re not bugging (they enjoyed the zoo adoption shit once explained, and nobody’s going hungry). 

Once they learned that over 100% of the stock got shorted and that “the internet” painted a target on them, they changed their tune on their decision. I explained that Melvin’s ego got them caught up in a positive feedback loop of brokers issuing options, and how WSB sleuths can track heavily shorted stocks with publicly available information to make sure these moves get punished. My parents are now ready to toe the line about shitty-decision making. To quote, “We want someone less visible and smarter.”

I don’t know what our family investment strategy is going to be from here on out, but they’ve certainly soured on these morons who don’t know when to call it quits. If you have wealthy parents, I recommend you talk to them about the whole thing and spare the jokes. Once you talk about the poor fundamentals and how people are paying attention, you might see them change their tune.

I’ve only got my one share, but it opened a dialogue about teaching a lesson to people who won’t learn it. Maybe telling our story will do enough to encourage a smarter market without reckless positions, maybe not. Maybe there’s more short squeezes before hedge funds realize themselves. Either way they’ll probably be missing some money from me and mine. Just thought I’d share my story here.

tl;dr: talk to anyone close who’ll listen about reinvesting from vultures with too much dip on their chip. They might just thank you.","If you have wealthy parents, talk to them about hedge funds!",1.0,1615873001,ViceMedicine
