50,lx54cp,"I can’t comment on the RKT and GME thread because I’ve been a lurker for most of my Reddit life. This is my first post ever, how thrilling 😬

To all the RKT haters, theres plenty of DD on why RKT could go up by 3/5. If we all stuck together we could help the squeeze then put those profits into GME.
Everyone who is shutting down RKT holders because it’s not GME is dividing us and I’m sure making some feel like they don’t want to help the GME squeeze now.
What do you think Hedgies feel when they read how divided we are becoming? 

Disclaimer: I own positions in both GME and RKT. I believe RKT will increase in price by Friday. I will then continue assisting with the GME squeeze. 
Peace and love apes 🦍

53,lx54ra,"Don’t know if your allowed to post about actual companies with great potential anymore (that isn’t gme or rkt) but Top Golf was going to IPO earlier last year for $4 billion. Because of the rona, they decided to sell to Callaway (ELY) instead. Today, shareholders voted to approve the merger (no news yet but most likely overwhelming approval). Here’s the kicker, Callaway only paid $2 bill for the company!!! Super Cheap!

Top Golf does close to $2 billion in revenue a year with only 60 locations and they are growing super fast. Call any Top Golf around and chances are, there is a wait. If you want to get in on this before Top Golf continues to explode, now is the time to buy at a huge discount. 

I could post much better DD but what seems to work best is to say, “ELY good, buy ELY and get bananas. Wife might even start loving you again.”
