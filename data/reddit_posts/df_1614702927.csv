&amp;#x200B;

i knew it was some kind of sequence...  
we now know they were only buying time to delay the squeeze and limit the hémorrage, but it's over now, look as the pattern repeat itself but the sequence is narrower each time, the time they are buying is costing more and more so they can only buy less, less share available, make the itteration narrower each time, but what about this fractal???

Regarding the numbers, data etc, what ccan you make about it?

I knew they were participating in the Cowen Healthcare Conference so I did some googling and searching through WSB and the rest of Reddit for some info.. found nothing.

After scouring the internet for a while I ended up on their website to check for announcements for investors, etc. Anything that might provide some hint as to why it was halted and I noticed a social network feed at the bottom of the site referencing a tweet (link to the tweet was broken but confirmed on their 200-follower account..) stating that their MosaiQ COVID-19 Antibody Microarray (for early detection) had received EUA from the FDA.
