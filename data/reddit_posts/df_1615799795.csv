9,m5gu2q,"大家好，我来自中国，今天我给大家分享一只股票，并非投资建议。这只股票叫BIOC，是一家癌症诊断公司，专注于开发和销售专有的利用血液样本检测。 我喜欢这只股票基于以下2点考虑，请大家走过路过不要错过。1、虽然这只股票长期下滑，曾经甚至跌为毛票，它的业绩长期低迷，一直处于亏损状态。但在去年由于新冠疫情开始受到了关注，期间断断续续爆涨过几次。在2020年11月12日公布第三季度财报那2天，股价上涨了30%。仔细研究财报你会发现，第三季度营业收入为658.61万元，同比增长330%。这仅仅是一个季度的收入，要知道该公司2019年的营业收入才552.86万元。目前前3个季度的营业总收入约为895万元。为什么营业收入突然会有这样的增长，原来是因为这个公司在2020年8月份开始经营了一项新的业务，测试COVID-19样本，每测试一个样本，政府补贴100美金，所以营业收入才暴涨。以下是相关数据：2020年8月3日公布已经收到7000个样本，8月31日公布已经收到21000个样本，9月16日公布已经收到35000个样本，10月29日公布已经收到80000个样本，11月12日公布已经收到100000个样本（此时公布财报，前3个季度的营收已达895万元），接下来12月14日公布已经收到150000个样本。2021年2月3日公布已经收到250000个样本。因此重点来了，通过以上检测样本的数量，在接下来2021年3月24日即将公布的年报，我预测营业收入还要增长（150000-100000）X100美金=500万的收入。也就是说2020年的总体收入至少在895万+500万，大约至少有1400万的收入，相对于2019年的收入是涨了153%！在3月24日公布财报的那2天，我希望能看到股价也跟着翻倍。以上是基于财报的看法，接下来谈谈这个公司。2、由于新冠疫情的肆虐，这个检测业务估计还会持续很长一段时间，并且Cathie Wood曾经提到，她的基金公司下一步会重点留意癌症检测公司（这个消息大家自行查找即可）。因此这家公司的前景我也非常看好。匆匆忙忙在上班时间写下这些文字，不是投资建议，也请各位批评指正。

My English is not good, the content is too much, the following is machine translation: 
Hello everyone, I am from China. Today I will share a stock with you, not investment advice. The stock is called BIOC, a cancer diagnostic company that focuses on the development and sales of proprietary blood sample tests. I like this stock based on the following two considerations, please don't miss it when you pass by. 
1. Although this stock has been declining for a long time, it has even fallen into gross votes, its performance has been sluggish for a long time, and it has been at a loss. However, last year, due to the new crown epidemic, it began to attract attention, and during the period, it has exploded several times intermittently. In the two days when the third quarter financial report was announced on November 12, 2020, the stock price rose by 30%. If you carefully study the financial report, you will find that the operating income in the third quarter was 6,586,100 yuan, a year-on-year increase of 330%. This is only one quarter's revenue. You must know that the company's operating revenue in 2019 is only 5.5286 million yuan. The current total operating income for the first three quarters is about 8.95 million yuan. Why did the operating income suddenly increase like this? It turned out that the company started to operate a new business in August 2020, testing COVID-19 samples. For each sample tested, the government subsidized 100 US dollars, so operating income skyrocketed. . The following are the relevant data: 7000 samples were announced on August 3, 2020, 21000 samples were received on August 31, 35000 samples were received on September 16, and 35000 samples were announced on October 29. To 80,000 samples, it was announced on November 12 that it had received 100,000 samples (the financial report was announced at this time, and the revenue in the first three quarters had reached 8.95 million yuan), and it was announced on December 14 that it had received 150,000 samples. It was announced on February 3, 2021 that 250,000 samples had been received. Therefore, the key point is that based on the number of samples tested above, in the next annual report to be published on March 24, 2021, I predict that operating income will increase (150,000-100000) X 100 US dollars = 5 million income. In other words, the total income in 2020 will be at least 8.95 million + 5 million, and there will be at least 14 million in income, which is an increase of 153% relative to the income in 2019! In the two days when the financial report was announced on March 24, I hope to see the stock price also double. The above is based on the view of the financial report, let's talk about this company. 
2. Due to the raging new crown epidemic, this testing business is expected to continue for a long time, and Cathie Wood once mentioned that her fund company will focus on cancer testing companies in the next step (you can find this information yourself). Therefore, I am very optimistic about the prospects of this company. Writing these words in a hurry during working hours is not investment advice. Please criticize and correct me.",hey i come from China ，here to share a stock $BIOC🙏🏻,1.0,1615800231,chungege

17,m5gwy8,"Hi fellow rebels,

it is my first post and I see there is already 9 million people around here which is a power of a small country. Congrats!

I thought that it's really neat that there has been found a way to fight the big money players as a community.This stirred the pot and got a lot of people aware of the holes in the current financial system. 

Now, with so many users, I was thinking maybe there is another way of picking a fight.

Based on information we generate this time... Inspired by pumps.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario:

1. We generate a story about a flaw in company X, that affects the Y and Z and share it million times on social media soon before the market closes. I am not talking about making a story from thin air, rather being really diligent against X for reasons R. 
2. As late as it is possible, before market closing we coordinate community shorting of company X stock, that might have been neatly aggregated shortly before solely for that purpose.
3. Next day the numbers pile up, the news start picking it up and the perceived value of the company drops pretty sharply. Here crucial is selection of the branch where X operates. No expert here but generating significant fluctuations in stock value should be achievable.
4. Once the stocks drops sufficiently low, or after preset time limit: Rebuy all stock at a discount equal to the drop we generated.
5. Have a story prepared that discredits the author of the original story with a magical twist, where the company X which we picked, looks even more promising than before.
6. Bonus, now millions of more people know about company X and its stock bought at a generated discount, should regulate itself even higher than before this operation UPLIFT started.
7. Stonks.

&amp;#x200B;

Science fiction novel down to points is over. Now is time for you to point out all the flaws and backfires to me and probably roast me for not adhering to some rules of the community, which with time I will gladly understand.   


Meanwhile, 

All the best

I don’t know weather the big boys upstairs will allow GME to surpass the $500 mark. Should we be focusing PLTR? Or perhaps some up in comers like TTCF? Realistically how do I limit the amount of heart ache we’re going to suffer? I propose holding GME for the foreseeable future, however I’m pretty torn here. I see everyone throwing everything they have in to this stock expecting to make a quick buck. I really don’t think the hedge funds are going to make it that easy for us. Please air on the side of caution guys. These are some pretty educated people we’re dealing with here. I’d be surprised if they don’t have something planned. They will either use us or find a way to tank the stock again! It is stupendously over bought mind you. I know this is going to down voted but I’m just asking you all to stay safe!

71,m5hjap,So I’ve joined this subreddit after hearing of all the gme stuff going way back when it all started. Well anyway today I’ve found out green light has an investing option and I own one ( I’m very young). Anyways I’ve been around In this subreddit looking at how things work and I want to try investing into something. So I thought why not ask the people of wallstreetbets? Any advice would be appreciated as I’m not too sure as to what I might be doing I just know I’m very interested. If I can get some good suggestions I will try to see if I can get approved.,Hello everyone!,1.0,1615803263,PuzzledProduce1710

The amount held by independant investors after the dip has also increased from 7.35% to 7.49% which shows that Apes actually HODL and bought even more shares after the attack. I am proud of you retards.   
**Remember though,** if you want to squeeze this further we must BUY AND HOLD, do not SELL at the peak and re-enter at the bottom, By doing so you are allowing Shorts to get their hands on real shares which is diminishing the squeeze potential and in the process making it harder for the long whales to win this fight.

This just shows how retail investors are nothing but **pawns** in a chess match and the Long Whales get to the strongest mooves.   
The great thing about being a pawn though is that if you hold till the end and push far enough you get to become a **Queen.**

95,m5hu3s,"Hi fellow apes,

I'm confused about naked puts. Are naked puts when I sell puts without having the cash to buy the shares from the Buyer of my put options in case the price goes below the strike price?   
I read on Investopedia that naked puts are when I write puts ""without having a short position in the underlying stock"". Now from what i understood a short position is when I borrow stock from someone and sell it in hopes the price goes down. If the latter is the case this would fully hedge me against falling prices because my shorts would be profitable for the same amount that I would lose on my puts. But wouldnt that be stupid hedging? Because if the price rises which is good for my put but I only keep the premium I at the same time lose a lot on my shorts.  


Thank you all for your help in advance.
