I mean when the January squeeze was about to happen this was all new and not that many (including me) knew about it. I first heard about it when it was around 270$ and jumped on the rocket. By now many of us has been averaging down alot which means we holding a much bigger percentage of the stock and more and more people have jumped on the rocket by time.

Also the people right now have been thruough fucking hell which leads that they not letting go of the stocks easy. If this would have happened in January I think a big percentage would have been satisfied and sold around $1000. Now it‚Äôs a whole different scenario where we been fighting hard and we see more value in the shares. The HFs will not get them cheap to say the least.

57,m0s0qf,"I know this sub is flooded with these types of posts lately, but I thought I'd share my story.

7 months ago to (to the day) I was at my lowest low.  I barely remember this period due to benzo and alcohol abuse, but I had been homeless for a few weeks at that point.  I had abused crack previously but when I lost access to my bank account I was doing anything cheap.

Although not officially divorced my wife had kicked me out (can't blame her) and I had almost nobody willing to pull me out of the spiral.  During this period my daughter (black) kept asking ""where's daddy?  I want to see daddy"", it absolutely breaks my heart to think of what she went through.

Anyways my wife had emptied our joint bank account and I couldn't handle sleeping on the street sober.  I got to a shelter, and after somewhat getting cleaned up I was able to rent out my friend's garage and stock shelves at the Safeway.  But I was getting fairly depressed and would occasionally enter spirals of substance abuse, it seemed like a full relapse was right around the corner.

When sober, I spent most of my afternoons in the library, where I learned about you retards.  And once I remembered my IRA was still well stocked, I immediately began taking advice from some of you.  I couldn't believe it, the rush from day trading felt EXACTLY LIKE CRACK.  And the money I made was FAR more than a days work at safeway.

I was all in GME at 73, and can't convey to you how it felt to know I was going to be rich.  We're all going to be rich.  Thank all of you autists so much for helping me and helping each other!

79,m0s4i6," TACO Earning Report released this afternoon!

My degenerate smooth brain says to go get me some TACO sauce before buying video games at GME! Put on your seatbelt and get ready for the best TACO sauce DD ever!!! 

Why was Del Taco‚Äôs earning report awesome? Because they bought back a bunch of their shares last quarter! Not to mention they have been serving boatloads of Tacos to smooth-brained monkeys like me and increasing their Tendies to 2019 levels with fewer stores opened! 

We all know with the $1.9 trillion relief package on the horizon the demand for Fast Food will be increasing! Why?... because more stimulus money plus all this talk about marijuana legalization plus getting ready for GME rockets to the moon makes smooth-brained monkeys want to load up on fast food with 8 meals a day! 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the TACO sauce highlights:

1. Earning report had an EPS smashing analysts‚Äô estimates by 6 cents on a per-share basis! TACO Sauce factory is loaded!

2. Only 5.9 million shares of TACO sauce available for General Public purchase. The company repurchased 496,356 shares last quarter! Low available shares = Volatility if demand for TACO increases!

3. Fintel shows Insider ownership of 56.22% with no one selling in the past two years! C-Suite has the biggest Dimond Hands ever!!!

4. 10% short interest stuck prior to earning report!

5. Franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5%! The company is looking to pivot with more franchisees as they bring in the Tendies!

6. New ‚ÄúFresh Flex‚Äù Store design recently announced to new franchise owners. Double drive-through lanes, delivery pick-up stations, and dedicated parking lot areas for those who want to park, eat tacos, smoke weed, and go!

7. Del Taco is expanding into Columbus Ohio! Market exposure into Columbus = more TACO sauce price increase! 

8. Del Taco's Twitter page shows the Crispy Jumbo Shrimp TACO is back. This is probably not relevant but who cares!

9. The TACO sauce is currently undervalued as the Analyst show a strong buy with a price target of $12.5 on average and $15 high. Currently, there is a low resistance barrier at $11.71 and if it is passed tomorrow, then the sky is the limit!

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice. I don‚Äôt smoke weed, I love Tacos, I love the Stock, and I believe TACO sauce is extremely undervalued and needed to fuel my future GME moon voyage!
