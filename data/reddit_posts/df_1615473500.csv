The Uptick Rule (also known as the ""plus tick rule"") is a rule established by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC) that requires [short sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp) to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.

## Understanding the Uptick Rule 

The Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick.  


KEY TAKEAWAYS:

* The SEC's Uptick Rule requires short sales to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.
* There are limited exemptions to the rule.
* A revised rule implemented in 2010 lets investors exit long positions before short selling is triggered.

22,m2rmnh,"A few days ago I finally decided to visit this page and I got a headache after two minutes of seeing GME over and over again (is this page exclusively for GME?) A couple weeks ago, when GME had that steep rise, I was listening to a business news radio show for two hours and during that time they had two guests who were bragging that they were going to donate their gains from their GME trades (it sounded like sponsored content). Of all the companies on the stock market and other more important events going on, they dedicated airtime all day talking about one measly retail company that sells toys...fucking toys! I didn't get it. But now, I'm convinced that GME was the perfect stock choice used by wall street to lure new young people into their casino. Since the pandemic started, people have been spending a lot of  time alone in isolation playing video games. Combine that with being unemployed, desperate to make  money fast, and reading posts online about the next hottest stock (something that can be generated by scripts), you can condition people on a subconscious level into believing that they can get rich quick by investing in GME. It was the perfect storm. Some rode the wave and made it, but the majority of the people got hurt -and I'm not talking about hedge funds. Hedge funds are like casinos in Vegas. Once in a while, a casino will go out of business, but there are still a lot of other ones that are running and will keep taking peoples money. I've heard people compare this event to David and Goliath. But, this was just one Goliath they slayed out of an entire army of Goliaths. Take a step back and look at the big picture. Ever since Steam came out, I've only downloaded games. And when I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to buy Gameboy Advance games back in 2010, I bought them on eBay (since GameStop had a limited library). GameStop had a good run, but technology has made them obsolete (like Kodak).",Stop the GME madness.,1.0,1615473679,Igor_d7

43,m2rpfy,"Hello fellow apes, I'm new here... Well I was a month ago.. now I feel like I just lost my virginity.

First of all, I got to say, that I've realy enjoyed my month playing this inmersive game, of a genre I've never touched before.

I used to play mmos, not WoW, the cheap ones, since I'm euro trash from shithole village. But I'm pretty familiar with overcomplicated mechanics that make no fucking sense at all, and then the admins doing always the poorest of jobs.

So this SEC guys, the admins arround here from what I understood, are kind of lame... Those big guys exploiting in-game mechanics ought to be permanly banned from the game, like any other logical institution would do when the cheaters keep on cheating, again and again.

Also in the balancing field they are pretty lame too. Hedgies should be nerfed since they are so freaking overpowered against little investors. Retail should be buffed, not above big money (im from west eu, no commie, plz dont beat me), but at least to a even field.

In the other hand, I realy found many usefull guides to get a fast start from noobtown, which in a game with so many arbitrary rules of course it's a good thing to have. The game also have amazing communities, mainly this one, the populars arround mainstream media realy suck.

Overall I've liked the game, got a few laughts.. I found a nice strategy to keep my portfolio green ($GME 👐💎🚀). Which after some weeks was getting kind of stagnant and boring... so the dip yesterday was kind of fun... Made for a few laughts, and some new additions for my future green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I'd recomend it 7/10. There's better games, far more complex and with fairest competition. Although noone compares in revernue stream, so I guess I'll keep on playing with you my beloved apes.

I highly recommend read the Prequels before going ahead with the sequels. Disclaimer, this sequel will not be as good as the origin post!

For the people who followed $UWMC yesterday, you could see that every upwards burst was Thanosed instantly on spot within minutes by large volumes of share dumping, as if **it was done by a big holder trying to prevent a Tsunami of a breakout.** Yesterday's events confirmed some of my hypothetical suspicions mentioned in Part 2(though still an opinion). Bellow is yesterdays chart, and as you can see that there is a massive volume of share dumping instantly after every large buying orders. I've never seen this before on this magnitude and coordination. 

[Link to Chart](https://preview.redd.it/6r9jcaxhqem61.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e14aaf74ff3befe3d1e6765723dc9be4687ba9a)

For that reason(and as mentioned in Part 2), I'll be sticking to buying shares not calls. In fact, yesterday after I posted, I bought 7000 fresh shares of $UWMC. 

**Potential upcoming catalyst? :** Now you might've seen the CEO on twitter replying to Jim Crammer and telling him that he'd be honored to be a guest on his show. Now if I were in his place(CEO), The most ideal time for me to appear on MAD Money would be on the episode closest to the expiration of 03/19/2021 CALLS. Why??!! To build the buying pressure against MM's and try to trigger a short squeeze to 10$+ where a Gamma squeeze is patiently waiting to happen. Now why would the CEO not capitalize on a **rare position** of having a **massive Gamma Squeeze** waiting to happen?

Below is his tweet:

[CEO tweet to Jim Cramer](https://preview.redd.it/oqedppb6tem61.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=249de13d630bb50e0491d08c287c2c18b9c79d22)

In summary, I wouldn't buy any $UWMC Calls anymore because they are useless in my opinion towards the stock and have a high risk of expiring worthless. On the other hand, I would only buy shares and hope for the CEO to be as smart as I expect him to be in capitalizing on the Gamma squeeze which is patiently waiting to happen.

Note: this is not financial advice and I am not a financial adviser. I made this story up, it is entirely fiction.

This is a poem about my favorite stock GME

I’ve been there in the good and bad you see

It all started a few months ago

When the hedgies did a bit too much blow


GameStock, they said was going to plummet.

It’s dieing retail, it’ll never reach the summit 

But little did they know there was not a cat in town

Who noticed the antics of these hedgie clowns


Buy the dip he said from $4 to $2

It was dismal it seemed, the buying was through

But then all of a sudden, Ryan Cohen hopped aboard

He bought into the stock, this could not be ignored!


People realized the value of this great stonk

The price skyrocketed, the hedge funds in shock

But then the hedgies thought we cannot let this be

Retail traders, beating us? We’re losing our money tree.


So the hedgies decided they would take a stand.

Against “dumb money” (that’s us) and the WSB brand.

They gave millions to officials news outlets and more

To spread the story that GME would make everyone poor


Their FUD wasn’t working billions down the drain

They decided to restrict trading to stop the retail gain

No more shares could be bought, you could only sell

The problem is, we didn’t hear no bell


As the stock dropped to $40, I sank to my knees

The market was rigged and I didn’t have the keys

They change the rules when they want

As the ultra rich twitter warriors, gloat and taunt


The paper hands started screaming, we told you so!

In disbelief I saw the number -90% and below.

But then I realized a small and true fact

That I could actually survive these attacks


It wasn’t a loss until I actually sold

So I did something others, might have called bold.

I doubled down on my shares and lowered my cost

As the price continued to decrease all seemed to be lost


Then a glimmer of light started to shine through.

The headbanded investor bought more for me and for you.

This catalyst was all that the stock seemed to need

As the price rose, and hedgies again started to bleed.


The price hit almost $400 and dropped like a rock

$198 the chart said, the chat screaming what the fock

The price jumped back up quick and went back to even

I doubled my resolve, this is a stock to believe in


And now we have made it to today

What side are you on and with what do you play 

Make a choice, hold or buy if you can

Just make sure you are going in with your own plan.


GameStonk to the moon, yet again it seems

It can stay a great rocket, just through all the great memes

To the moon we may go, keep us In your prayers

At the end of the day, power to all the players

85,m2ruan,"It's so disheartening the amount of ""news"" articles that come out that purposely try and discourage people from holding this stock. Right before market opens, right when there's a massive dip, anytime there's a window for doubt, these reports just double down on how bad it is to have GME and how anyone who's smart should get rid of it. 


If this ends up being what we all think it's going to be, I genuinely hope everyone takes time to review, message, publically call out, etc. All these places that were so obviously trying to stop it from happening. Post screen shots of their blatant lies, post clips of the reports that (hopefully in hindsight) turn out to be beyond suspiciously sinister in intention. Like ""hey so remember when you said, article after article after article, that this was all nonsense? Well now you have two choices either *A)* you are a mediocre news source who clearly did not do any DD about the situation. And you wear that infront of all your subscribers. Or *B)* you admit you knew exactly what could happen and instead _actively_ campaigned against it for private interest reasons. 

Pick your dunce cap. You wanna be the idiot news source who's bad at investigating. Or you wanna be the corrupt news source who's willing to psychology attack the many, in order to protect the status quo/the wealthy. There is no accountability in a world where fads and viral videos pop up daily like weeds, but honestly this level of corruption needs to be continuously highlighted so EVERYONE can know who the good actors were and who the bad ones were. 


Plus hopefully we'll all have enough money to hire our own reporter. I'm going to get mine to create a video every week reminding everyone who said what, when they said, and all the reasons they said it. When you lift a rock, all the cockroaches scatter. Well this rock is lifting and we better make sure every cockroach who thought they were safe in the shadows gets their day in the sun.","Once we're on the moon, let's make sure we do some house keeping on Earth.",1.0,1615474236,JuuustLurkin
