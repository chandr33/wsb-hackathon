12,m63kmk,"I'm bullish on PYPL and bought some when it dropped to its 100 moving average of $230. This partnership with Flutterwave might be the kick my spreads needed.

To quote from the article, 

&gt;It is nearly impossible for businesses in some African countries to receive money from PayPal. While the payments giant has not given reasons why this is so, speculation hints at factors like insufficient regulation and poor banking security in said countries.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;That might be a thing of the past for some businesses as African payments company [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/) today is announcing a partnership with PayPal to allow PayPal customers globally to pay African merchants through its platform.  
&gt;  
&gt;Via this partnership, businesses can connect with the more than [377 million PayPal accounts globally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218493/paypals-total-active-registered-accounts-from-2010/) and overcome the challenges presented by the highly fragmented and complex payment and banking infrastructure on the continent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions**

I bought a vertical spread expiring March 23rd and when Paypal dropped more last week I bought another spread expiring March 19th.

**SQ vs Paypal?**

I'm leaning more towards SQ than Paypal lately. Someone bought $1,608,540 \~1.6 million dollars worth of March 26 Calls at $270 strike price. What do you guys think is a better play in short term (3-5 weeks), SQ or PYPL?

15,m63m6l,"Well, here's part 2, which is much shorter than my part 1. Hopefully you can ready while taking a dump. This version will also be PG, so it will be a little easier to read without all that fuck's and shits :\\

**Producer Prices Index** **(PPI) &amp; Consumer Prices Index (CPI)**

This time I'm going to be comparing the PPI and the CPI to get an idea of how inflation could look in the next year or so. From a business standpoint, the PPI can be used to estimate input costs (especially commodities) for production, while the CPI can be used to estimate the output prices for consumers. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp)

Also, to be specific on the CPI I'm comparing the general one, which includes consumer discretionary goods (you know, lambos and yachts), whereas Core CPI tracks essential good prices, like groceries, gas, etc. (the stuff everyone needs to live). 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coreinflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coreinflation.asp)

As you can see, both lines tend to move with one another, but the PPI tends to be more erratic than the CPI. If we go back to 2008, we can see that the PPI sky-rocketed (probably due to companies going bust and inflation speculation), yet the CPI didn't budge a whole lot. This means that producers had to pay extra money for production, but they couldn't raise prices all that much on consumers. So that means, companies were *eating profits to keep doing business.* 

For example, I'm a widget maker and I can typically sell my widgets for $5 and competition is fierce! However, the plastic prices for my widgets went up by $0.25/widget.  If can try to  raise prices to $5.25, but I know my customers will buy from someone else. Instead, I'll find other places to cut prices, like buying different plastics, getting more efficient machines or letting go of workers. Don't you touch my annual bonus though! 

While commodity prices are climbing, it almost looks like business as usual the PPI. My worry is that the CPI won't keep up with the PPI. And just think about it for a minute, why would we be getting stimmy checks? So we consumers can help support these higher PPI movements.

**TLDR:** Consumers will avoid hyper-inflated products, unless they're necessities (Core CPI items). If consumers won't buy expensive products, companies can a) eat profits until conditions get better b) discontinue products until conditions get better c) go out of business because they can't sell products any further. **Therefore it's retarded to assume hyper-inflated commodities will always lead to hyper-inflated consumer goods (CPI).**

16,m63m84,"So earlier this evening, some of us Apes had a moment of clarity and concocted an idea after hearing about how Citadel is now borrowing 600 Million after just loading Melvin 2.8 Billion....

It just doesn't seem like these guys are making smart investment decisions and [inspired by this letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxe2pv/lose_enough_money_with_fidelity_and_theyll_send/) one of our own received from Fidelity - we thought a letter suggesting they ""review their investment strategy"" would be appropriate... as a full-page ad... in the Wall Street Journal!  üôä

Here's [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5tin0/citadel_borrows_600000000_thats_600_million/gr2rngx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that hatched the idea.

Upon doing some investigating (banging chest and pounding my keyboard with rocks) I've discovered the highest potential [cost of a full-page](https://classifieds.wsj.com/get-an-estimate/), national ad in WSJ is $287,741.16  (That's for a ""legal notice"" ad category, other categories are cheaper, but I'm not sure what category this would fall under)

AT $50 a pop, that would only take 5,755 of us Apes (or 14.38 shares of GME) to pitch in and we're golden!

I've already got my GoFundMe account setup but before creating the campaign I wanted to put the idea out into the WSB ether for comment as well as get the blessing of the Mods.  üôå

It would also be great if one - or a few - of you wordsmiths could put together a rough draft of the letter.

I would like to share my retarded  thoughts with you regarding this entire story of GME.

1. Buying GME means avoiding that over 10'000 employees lose their job because of the greed of some hedge funds, which means 10'000 family and more specific around 30'000 people risk to face a real bad time during this absurd world situation.

2. Buying GME means giving a signal that if we are strong together we can face every thing, we are experiencing a fantastic humanity and solidarity.

3. Buying GME means possibly getting f...ing rich

4. Buying GME and hodling them is a signal of a sort of revolution in the financial and economic world.

Conclusion: being part of this community will make you laugh(thanks for your meme and gif), will educate you(thanks for all the analysis and explanation), will give you the possibility to be part of something amazing and huge, and will inspire you to show your kindness and solidarity to other apes.

Itau is one of the largest Brazilian banks, has a rigorous history of merger and aquisition strategy to increase market share, \~8% revenue decline in 2020 compared to \~20% for the industry big boys (JPM, Citi), and my Brazilian friend said they were the best out of Itau, Bradesco and Santander. Currently undervalued. 

The stock is still \~50% off Jan 2020 highs, with a recent upwards trends undercut by the wider Brazil Inc slump. I won't re-litigate all of the causes thereof, but basically: 

\- virus stuff (new strain, 'scary' numbers, low vaccination rates)

\- perception of instability (potential ex-president political comeback) 

\- el Presidente, excoriated by the idealogical hack western press. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Turn** 

These obstacles are unapalatble enough for this to be a contrarian idea. That understood, they are also not real problems for the banks. 

\-  Virus hysteria seems more and more like special pleading re the media and health admins 

\-  Lula might run, he might also be convicted again. Either way, although his brand is still strong (and being old and crazy seemed to help Biden), the Worker's party brand is still toxic. The election is October 2022, stocks will bounce back in between the headlines. 

\- People will obviously have an opinion based on their political position. Frankly, I like the guy, and respect the message. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Prestige** 

Brazil has a funny trend of shitting the bed when you expect it to pay off, and paying off when you expect it to shit the bed. My analysis is that the negative catalysts have been priced in, blood is in the streets, and the probability of positive catalysts appearing before September is greater than 0.5.
