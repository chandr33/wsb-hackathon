It would behoove you to buy an extra share to minimize the lost extra. Example.

24,ly2vww," 

What is Winnebago ($WGO)? Winnebago is the OG RV company. When boomers think of RVs they think of Winnebagos. They've been in business since 1954 and they might be a great company - but they're at ATH and they're due for a pullback.

$WGO has earnings coming up on 3/26 and I'm betting that they're going to drop. Here's why:

**1 - This is the biggest one for me - their Execs are selling**. Execs now own less than 4% of the company and they've been selling like crazy. In Q4 2020 &amp; Q1 2021 alone they've sold $18mm worth of shares and bought $0.  **I had linked the data here but the spambot won't let include it.  It's easily searchable ""wgo insider trading""** 

Now I am functionally retarded, but to me this says that the execs know something we don't.

**2 - They had an insane 2020** \- dropping from $61 to $22 when COVID hit, then spiking up to $60 and holding above $70 (ATH) for the past few months. Everyone knows that 2020 was THE year of the road trip - and RVs had [record sales](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/travel-trends/rv-sales-increase-coronavirus). If there was EVER a year for $WGO to be ATH it was 2020. But guess what - it's 2021 bitches and this shit is all about REOPENING.

Every single person I know is planning flights and vacations on a beach somewhere that's not inside of a fucking RV.

Think of $WGO as the opposite of airlines and cruise stocks. Those stocks got killed in 2020 and they're finally recovering with the reopening. $WGO should be dropping - why is it still at ATH?

**3 - They had supplier issues in 2020 -** Although demand was there they weren't able to fully capitalize on it. Despite crushing their earnings, their stock tanked after ER last year because of a report that they were having supplier problems. This may be resolved now, but I think it just goes to show how sensitive this stock is

4 - [Zacks is all over their nuts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-winnebago-wgo-poised-beat-171005758.html) \- If there's anything I've learned from hanging out here it's that the media loves to make bagholders out of retail. Anytime I see positive headlines out of these fucks my instinct is to do the opposite. Fuck Zacks, Fuck Yahoo Finance - I'm inversing those bitches.

5 - **What will their guidance be? -** Their ER is on 3/24 and their forecast EPS is 1.37. Last ER they did 1.69...it doesn't matter, everyone knows those numbers don't mean shit anymore for some reason. Now it's all about guidance and I'm having a hard time imagining how they're going dance around the fact that COVID IS OVER and people will be flying and taking cruises and doing all of the other normal shit they did back when the RV industry was declining every year.

**My Play -** I've done my fair share of earnings plays - I know about IV crush and I know you can counteract it with spreads, but I'm scared to sell any options, so I'm just holding Puts now and hoping for the best (worst for $WGO). I don't play many FDs and if $WGO does move it probably won't move a ton, so my position is **34 April 16 21’  $65 Puts**

I'll be the first to admit that this is nowhere near the god level DDs some people post here. I'd love to hear reasons why I'm retarded and am going to lose my entire $10k investment. I've still got one opportunity to bail - a major competitor (Thor Industries) $THO has their ER on 3/9 - I think the market's response to their ER will be very telling of how they'll treat $WGO. If they crush it then I might exit my $WGO puts.

Now I'm not one to bet against American companies, and I do hope to see them succeed. This is purely a way to make money. Its probably retarded, I'm retarded, and this is not investment advice.",DD: Why I'm Short Winnebago ($WGO),0.83,1614914762,johnnybonchance

55,ly337f,"Let’s start with some statistics since I’ve probably already lost half of you. Oh and 🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕

ASO (Academy Sports and Outdoors) is the big dick retailer for sporting goods in the state that loves them some spuurtin goooods. They are everywhere in Texas. You’ve probably seen charges from them on your statements... your wife’s boyfriend definitely shops there. It’s been around since they invited sports... 1938. Boomer Dan finally gave up control so they went public last year. Boomers didn’t raise no bitch though so they have on hand $870K with a little more than $2B debt. I’ll go into detail on fundamentals in a second.... nah fuck it.

Since short squeezes are all you fucks care about let’s go into detail on the retard fish death squeeze these shorts will be in if this dumpster catches fire. Current float is 31.06M shares with 12.79M of those shares short. Idk how the fuck the math works but somehow that equates to 49.08% of the float being short. These Dick holes don’t seem to learn. If this isn’t bad enough (it is) average daily volume is around 1.45M meaning it would take a week to cover (it won’t). The short ratio on these titties is 7.28 meaning shorts really have gone full retard on this thing (never go full retard).

What blows dick off is that they would short a company that had a yearly revenue of $5.46B, quarterly revenue growth of 17.8%, annual Gross profit of $1.4B and a solid cash to debt ratio. For ape this mean good business.

It’s one thing to short the ever living shit out of a company that is unproven, but ASO has been doing the damn thing for nearly 100 years. 

If you’re into trying to catch the next squeeze good luck, my wife’s boyfriend stole my crystal ball. But this is certainly set up for one. The boner on this is the company is a solid, revenue generating old school power house and going to be a good one for a long time to come. 

I don’t know what the fuck a financial advisor looks like so if you think I am one then eat a dick. Disclaimers are retarded and so are you if you think anything here is financial advice or delivered as such. 

TL;DR: ASO currently has 49% of its float shorted. SR of 7.28 it makes bank, solid revenue, cash flow

I believe they are working together on Amazon's long overdue Prime Air fleet which will give BB access to autonomous flight data from hundreds of thousands of drones. This will put them years ahead of any evtol manufacturer or rtos developer and secure a monopoly in endpoint management for virtually anything on the IOT and is capable of moving vertically.

Today, BlackBerry was featured at Morgan Stanley Technology's media conference. Charles Eagan (BB's Chief Tech Officer) answered a bunch of questions about security, IVY, QNX, end-point management etc. [Link to Webcast](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1430549&amp;tp_key=381e2505f3). (Drones mentioned at 18 minutes)

When asked about drones, Charles said: ""we are not allowed to talk about which vendors are using which tech,"" and ""there is a number of active drone engagement that are happening""

This practically confirms my theory that 1) IVY is being developed for not just ground based vehicles but flying ones as well and 2) they are working on it with some degree of secrecy.

Amazon's drone fleet running on IVY will a great catalyst for BB share price... and that announcement can come at anytime. There is also some speculation going on about potential acquisition of BB, which isn't that far-fetched considering how John Chen joined Sybase in 1998, reinvented the company, and sold it to SAP a decade later.

📷level 3[MaC1222](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaC1222/)[5 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwje8/i_feel_retarded_as_f_is_amc_going_to_the_moon_or/gppi6sn/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I’m here to help. You bought 3 calls at $10 and you paid a premium for that. Well, someone had to sell you those options and they collected that premium from you. It’s cash in their bank and they can do anything they want with it.

You own at least 900 shares of AMC, well that means you can sell 9 covered calls to suckers on this sub. You might sell an option with a $10 strike price that will expire 3/12 and each option might be worth $50 in premium, I don’t know. So 9\*50=$450 dollars. Way to go. Go invest that money.

But mac1222, what happens if the price of the stock hits or goes above $10? Well, [u/isellgoodqualitygood](https://www.reddit.com/u/isellgoodqualitygood/), then your 900 shares will be “called” away and you’ll be paid $10 a share for each stock. That’s 9000 dollars. Don’t forget about the $450 you made!

What if the stock goes to $20 before the options expire. Well, mr good, you’ve lost out on a lot of potential profit. If you kept the stock, you would have made $18,000. But let me say it again....loss of potential profit. You never lost any of your original investment.

What if the stock does not hit $10? Well then, the options expire worthless and you keep the premium.

What if I want out of my contracts before expiration? Easy. Remember, when selling an option, you are “selling to open”. You will show “-9” because you are short. To get out of this agreement, you will have to “buy to close” those 9 contracts. Now you will have to pay the premium to buy them back. Poof....the transaction is over

Additionally, you will not be able to sell your 900 shares while you are under a contract. Your brokerage will hold them as collateral until the options expire; thus a covered call",Basics of a Covered Call by u/Mac1222,0.91,1614915937,MaC1222

 Most of the shorting is in the US 10 year.  Evidence is seen in the repo market... this is bond over night collateral lending.... this is a very big important chunk of the financial markets. 

There is a fail to deliver fee of -3% for 10 year repo.... in the article linked below you'll see a broker dealer was willing to pay -4.25%... taking more loss than a standard fail to deliver. This sort of thing happens when the fees for lending the 10 year bonds so their customer can short them  is going to more than cover the cost of this -4.25 rate the broker dealer will have to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

So what the banana loving apes think is going on? Why short the 10 year t bonds/notes and short so much to dislodge the repo market out of a governing mechanism ( the -3% fail to deliver borrowed collateral rate)?
