64,m73w2c,"Hello there, fellow apes.

I'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. 

I've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.

For example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:

[https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)

What bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.

Is it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. 

As far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.

I mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.

And no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)

TL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense.

TLDR; Drive Shack is an undervalued reopening play that is likely to triple in the next 6 months. Ape buy stock and ape get more banana. This is a stock trading under 5 that doesn't deserve to be. 

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack? A stock under $4 that could easily triple in the next 6 months. Read on my fellow YOLOers. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added even as you read this.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&amp;iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/onol6bvr2mn61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04860ba5eef28f682662148c2d8beede6f76b321

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/013zh9it2mn61.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edc5f5b676edd31a46cc1fd74e8e566b0297d255

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mwo08imw2mn61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f262dd405fa47813351cdcea968560765d0d7a

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&amp;P to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price.

# How High Can She Go?

Real high mother fucker. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s58jla0y2mn61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f28d112bad45f0a54349bc9ab53cbf6b04f7816

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. That’s right ape. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going to moon? No you wouldn’t dummy. But you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will only accelerate.

Realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&amp;A target as the market cap grows.** The market is forward looking and it will begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of shit. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? Those fuckers are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at it like your mom at the club. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory, like your shit stains do after several washes.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xq8axe4z2mn61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=453a2c552ed3bc3c3191199f72a7e3e6b03e0abb

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

&amp;#x200B;

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Overtime, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current price target for Drive Shack is $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.
