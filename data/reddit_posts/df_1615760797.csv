I'll cover stimmy checks, anticipating hedge fund tactics and upcoming events for March 19th in particular.

**Stimmy Checks:**

After the signing of the stimulus package, US apes are recieving funds beginning this weekend and continuing into the week.

Some simple back of the envelope maths to encourage fellow apes as to the power they have. Going to use some broad assumptions here, and attempt to give a rough estimate to within an order of magnitude. These are likely wildly wrong, keen to edit if other users have exact data for me.

9.5M members of WSB.

Assumption 1; 50% are active traders and bullish on GME and and would buy more this week if the opportunity arose.                                                                                                                                     Assumption 2; 35% are from the US.                                                                                                                          Assumption 3; 20% are bots.                                                                                                                                        Assumption 4; 10% of non-US members that are bullish on GME will #stimmyYOLO a similar amount of money.                                                                                                                                                                             Assumption 5; 80% of US apes are elligible for the stimmy.

9,500,000 x 0.8 x 0.35 x 0.8 = non bot bullish US apes eligible = 2,128,000                                                                        + 9,500,000 x 0.1 x (1 - 0.35) = non-US bullish YOLO apes = 617,500

1400 x 2,745,500 = $3,843,700,000

As such, my estimate would be that between 38B and 384M is the current size of WSB Capital's free cashflow as a result of the simulus bill. 

**Taking the lower bound of 384M, at current market price that nets WSB an extra 1.5M shares of GME.**

for context the total float is 55M shares and here are the current hedge fund positions as of their respective reporting dates: [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme).

This type of influx is potentially equivalent to a mid sized hedgefund buying and holding GME over the course of a week, independent of any other actors outside of the forum.

This is great news, But i'll go into how i'll be using my UK ape stimulus later in the post. (Happy to provide evidence to such a play, tuesday - friday i'll be buying some form of dip).

&amp;#x200B;

**Hedgie Tactics:**

Hedgies know about this influx of cash, and we saw on the 10th what they can do to the price. Hitting every single asking price and stop loss available to them while the volume is low.

If i were a hedgie looking forward to this week i'd anticipate a run-up from stimulus checks and March 19th's potential catalysts. I'd NEED confidence to be dashed during the week.

How would i do this? Wait for the run-up from the apes trying to get in before other apes, wait for the volume to dry up and do exactly what they did on the 10th, this could be any mid-day dry up - forever. We know what's on the line for them and the lengths they'll go to.

This is why i'm atleast holding half of my faux stimmy for this kind of fuckery. I'm already in, at a cost basis well below where we're at now. If we were a single actor like a hegde fund with this kind of ammunition while already being heavily invested in a stock, we would DEFEND our investment against market manipulation.

**Their only way out is to undermine confidence in the stock.** To scare retail investors out. To convince us that everyone else went home and you're holding the bag. This is why i'm holding my ammunition to defend against such fuckery.

A run up is still great. And those looking to get in for the first time should make their own decisions, because yes you could miss out if no fuckery ever comes.

The main thing here is that we individually invest rationally. Defend lines of support using technical analysis, and not chasing run ups. Outside hedgefunds and boomer retail investors WILL NOT care to do the due dilligence if we run up 100 dollars only to be short attacked back down, the Jim Cramer Market Watch shill narrative has only one way of winning and it's this.

But what if the dip came. The greatest act of market manipulation seen to date, with hundreds of millions of ape capital lying in wait. That would be the greatest financial event in history and would invite maximal confidence in the stock.

Note: as such i'm also waiting untill i believe the GME saga to be over before i adopt an ape. You can also hold me to this.

**Upcoming Dates: END OF BUISNESS YEAR SHENANIGANS**

XRT rebalancing March 19th:

As we have seen, Shitadel and Melvin have been shorting the ever loving fuck out of XRT and other ETFs containing GME. As the price of GME has risen since and they are also short the stock, the hedgies will have to supply the dividend and also the ETF will have to take in more stock in a rebalancing.

Quadruple witching day:

There are LOTS of calls expiring on this date as it marks the end of week, month, quarter and year. This does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. All it implies is that the stock will be volatile. There are thousands of calls in the money and out of the money but also thousands of puts (most at stupidly low levels, thanks hedgies).

Check em out here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  31,456 calls for $800.  
This just means that IF the snowball starts moving one way or the other, it will gain momentum FAST, with all of the calls sticking to it like proverbial snow.

Hedge funds announce profit/loss for year end:

This one's simple, shorts r fuk. Their investors may start to pull out if we hold these levels.

Earnings report 23rd march:

This could easily be another catalyst in the following week.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: IF NONE OF THIS SHIT HAPPENS, IT DOESNT MATTER AS RYAN COHEN WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP GAMESTOP INTO THE HUB FOR GAMING ECOMMERCE WITH THE HELP OF OUR ACTIVIST INVESTING. SHORTS ARE PERMENANTLY FUK IF WE HOLD, NO MATTER THE PRICE. THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF THIS COMPANY WILL BE PROVEN TO BE ABOVE THE MARGIN CALL VALUE OF MELVIN CAPITAL AT SOME POINT, BUT IT MAY HAPPEN SOON.

19,m568xl,"**How to play FOMC this week**

Haven‚Äôt really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn‚Äôt repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. More than likely, we will hear the policy changes, or the lack thereof, on the 17th. I've did a quick browse and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I‚Äôve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don‚Äôt want to read this, I‚Äôll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven‚Äôt kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I‚Äôll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don‚Äôt throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There‚Äôs a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won‚Äôt see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We‚Äôve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn‚Äôt a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won‚Äôt let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it‚Äôs not about if, it‚Äôs about when. Unlikely they‚Äôll let it fail right now. Most likely won‚Äôt crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won‚Äôt let this fall because it‚Äôll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won‚Äôt let this pop right now because we‚Äôre finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we‚Äôre in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We‚Äôre already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don‚Äôt worry it doesn‚Äôt matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can‚Äôt afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there‚Äôs inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I‚Äôd be cautious tho. Because there‚Äôs a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we‚Äôre in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I‚Äôd play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I‚Äôd begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I‚Äôd start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I‚Äôve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I‚Äôm talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don‚Äôt buy precious metals, because they‚Äôre not based off anything anymore. And they‚Äôre heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It‚Äôs currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it‚Äôll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you‚Äôve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it‚Äôs harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don‚Äôt inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren‚Äôt included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y‚Äôall. There‚Äôs money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can‚Äôt find it, keep looking. If there‚Äôs an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities 

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we‚Äôll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it‚Äôll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

I see we are buying a zoo. I come before you to beg for your assistance, oh fine simians, to throw some hard earned coins to the Wildlife Emergency Fund, in South Africa. This organization steps in to save wildlife in Africa who are about to be shot, starve, or die of exposure, and moves them to new reserves where they can be safe. 

Last year the organization defeated a Emirati Sheik to save 12 elephants who were dying of thirst on his property. Two of those elephants have now given birth, and the babies would otherwise have been dead. 

We work with organizations like The Aspinall Foundation and Wildlands, to rescue animals no one else will bother saving. 

The organization is new however, and is South Africa based, so no tax refunds ladies. But if you want to show your wife‚Äôs boyfriend how to shop at Wendy‚Äôs, then consider throwing me a DM.",Apes Help Rescue Elephants?,1.0,1615762458,blakkunicorn

79,m56phf,"Disclaimer: I am not an econimist. My uncle is, though. But I never talk to him. This is all speculative. 

If I could short our current system of 40 hour work weeks for pay, I would.

One of the reasons I believe Millenials are getting so into investing is because we've been given the short end of the stick on the value of labor. Most of us don't get paid nearly enough for what we do when comparing our generation's value/hour of labor to our parents'. This is well known and I doubt anybody here hasn't already spent countless hours considering this. But I don't think it's going to last that long.

Reasons:

1. UBI was a concept that was semi-popularized by Andrew Yang in 2019. Seeing the future of automation, he saw it as the only viable answer to the lack of need for labor in coming years. While this was shot down by many as unrealistic, the pandemic emphasized the need for a change in the system and made the idea far more popular, so much so that Canada actually created a monthly payment and many people in the US started to make the same argument. Many highly intelligent people support the idea. We could see this become a reality as early as in the next few years.
2. Piggybacking off UBI, there's no need for us to work-for-profit this much. The current system is broken. Life in the United States (and every other first-world country) is too complex. I'll be 32 in May. The amount of crap I have to do on a daily basis just to sustain my on-the-grid life seems like a hell of a lot more than my parents had to do when they were 32. I see this changing for humans in a couple of ways: Either AI does everything to keep up with the complexity, then becomes corrupted and collapses, or we just start to simplify our lives (AI probably still in the picture here (but who knows)). But the more we simplify, the less crap we'll have to pay for. We didn't use to have cell phone bills and 25 subscriptions. We didn't consume as much. We used to just hang out. Whatever happened to hanging around from trees like our ape brothers?
3. Society has a completely new capacity for cooperation. Look at what happened with GME. That was not coordination, but cooperation. The difference is shown by what people are doing with their gains: Paying off student loans, making down payments on houses for their families, paying loved one's medical bills, and adopting endangered animals, etc. Do you see what I'm saying?
4. If we didn't have to make money, we'd still be contributing to society. It's in our nature. Look at all these posts on Reddit. So many of them benefit others, and what do we get in return? Flair? We do it because we like to help others and it feels good to contribute. Look at all those apes you apes aped! That is one of the coolest things that has ever happened and you are LOSING MONEY DOING IT. I have always had faith in humanity, and this just reinforces it.
5. It also doesn't cost that much money to contribute to society.
6. To put all these other points together, if we get a UBI, there is less need for labor, life gets less expensive, and we still feel motivated to get out there and contribute.... no more 40hr workweek.

I get that to a lot of you this is going to sound idealistic, but I don't think it is that idealistic. I think it's realistic. I'm not saying we're going to lay on our asses all day. We just aren't going to spend most of our waking hours every day trying to get a paycheck. Some people will, and those people will probably earn more than the rest of us. But money will be more useful for some things than others, unlike now where our whole society is so tied to it you can hardly separate it from anything. And overall, life will be more balanced. Then I'll finally be able to act in commercials and host my own TV show without worrying about actually making it lucrative.",The future of work: we won't work,1.0,1615762955,permanentburner89

90,m56ri4,"When I saw the first posts about the first retard who adopted the gorilla and the lady from the foundation who responded, I felt a tinge of pride in my fellow retard. Wildlife conservation has always been one of the most important things to me. I understand how much contributions like that mean to these foundations.

This morning I woke up to post after post of all these animals being adopted. Falcons, elephants, rhinos, more gorillas, a hedgehog. I actually started to tear up as I was listing them off to my husband‚Äôs girlfriend. Steve Irwin would be proud of all you apes.

I‚Äôm too retarded to make words good. The point is, you guys have made such a massive impact on wildlife conservation that is so desperately needed. You‚Äôve already done 10000000x more for the world than any of those filthy hedgies would ever do. It makes me proud to be a retard. I‚Äôll deathgrip my shares until we buy up all these adoptable animals like we buy up every GME share we can.

If anyone still wants to get on this fuckn sweet train of buyin up all the wildlife, might I recommend San Diego Zoo Global? They have projects around the world benefitting many different plants, animals, ecosystems, and local people. They are an incredible organization. You can become a [Wildlife Ally](https://sandiegozoowildlifealliance.org) here and know your donation is making a global impact. You can learn more about their projects and the species they‚Äôre working to save [here ](https://science.sandiegozoo.org/our-science).
