376.42(big DP buy), 381.73(buy), 383.78, (386.98-387.65-389.82 big buys), 390.06(big sell), 390.59(sell), 391.91, 392.65(buy), (393.50-395.05 &lt;-prior ATH before big pullback), 396.75, 397.14(big DP sell), 397.83, 398.12(current ATH)‚Ä¶ 404.09 hard target for now.

**Daily levels**:

9ema ~ 391.56

20 sma ~ 389.49

50 sma ~ 386.491

100 sma ~ 375.43

Will use those 4 lvls ^^^^ as supports depending on where we are.

**Bullish scenario**:
Hard target at 404.09. With SPY closing today at 395.93, will use 391.56 (9ema) as strong bullish support. Had a very, very strong end of day push Friday. I am curious to see if /ES sells off that last hour and head back up slowly or stay sold off into open. 392.65 was somewhat a key dark-pool (DP) lvl. Would like that to be the bottom IF we do sell off into pre-market. 393.50-395.05 needed a high volume push to head higher which we got eod on Friday. IF futures hold all this into open. We are going to need another high volume push past 396.41-397.14 (huge DP sell). In order for us to head back to ATH (398.12) and more, we need to establish 397.14 as next strong base/support. It is possible we hit 397.14 and pullback a bit, IF this happens, next push will be very important to see if we get a push or 2nd rejection.

**Bearish Scenario**:
/ES would have to sell-off last few hours of Friday and hold. IF 392.65 act as major resistance, we can possibly back down to lower 390s. There is a ton of DP activity between 390-391. Next key lvls down are (390.59-390.06), if we head down there, be on alert because it‚Äôs possible we bounce there and push up again. 390.06 would have to act as another major resistance to head back into high 380s. (386.98-387.65-389.82) have lots of DP buying so could see some chop action. 386.49 is next DP sell AND also current daily 50sma, so would use that as complete bearish trend / all hell break loose lvl IF 386.49 acts as major resistance. Next stops below are \~(383.78-381.73). 381.73 is one of the strongest DP levels so cut all puts / hedges and be on stand-by.

**Kang-gang between**: 390.06-392.65-395.05-397.14-398.12+ (ATH)

9ema: 314.87

Will use those 4 lvls \^\^\^ as supports depending on where we are.

QQQ close on Friday was 316.01. We have tech ERs in about \~4 weeks so would like to see a run up start soon (usually 2-3 weeks prior). We have daily 9ema &amp; 20sma very close in range so will use 20sma lvl as slight, weekly bullish support at 314.08, with major support at 100sma (311.24). Huge tech rally should start once we establish 50sma(320.97)-321.57 (big dark-pool print) as base/support (currently below). I ALSO want to see **9ema cross 50sma on the daily (I circled prior crosses in blue)** chart for tech rally confirmation. We had a bullish, reverse H&amp;S rejection at \~323.85, therefore would like to see 323.85 hold for at least 1-2 days for 3rd and final confirmation for a solid push back to ATH (338.19)‚Ä¶ Super bearish if 100sma-9ema acts as major resistance (311.24-314.87) with 303.83 as hell break loose lvl IF that breaks and holds (unlikely for now, imo)

51,mfouy7,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals ($ALXN) is being acquired by AstraZeneca ($AZN). The cash and stock deal was announced on December 12th, 2020 

(see AZN's release: [https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html)).

Here are the most important sections, about the price paid to ALXN shareholders and about the closing:

 *""****Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares*** *(ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.""*

*"" Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition,* ***the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.*** *""*

&amp;#x200B;

Based on recent changes in relative prices, those who may be interested in buying AZN shares could acquire them at a discount via ALXN. 

Today's pre-market prices: AZN ADR $50,63 / ALXN $154,88

If the deal goes through (which is not a certainty at this stage; although I am no expert in regulatory aspects it seems unlikely to me that the deal might be blocked), the offer of AZN would value ALXN at $167.55/share ($60 + 2.1243 x $50.63), which is $12.67 (or 8.2%) above ALXN's current price. 

So, if you consider buying AZN, you may opt for the ALXN route which would give you a better entry price and some downside protection (discount + cash component of the offer). 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this is also an opportunity for arbitrageurs (Buy ALXN, short AZN) for those who are into that kind of strategies. The exchange ratio would require to be rounded (e.g., at 2.124x, you could trade multiples of 250; at 2.125x multiples of 8). Do not forget to include transaction costs and borrow rates in the equation.

In addition to the robust overall significance across all 196 treated patients at all 10 clinical sites, the prespecified analysis of recovery from respiratory failure is clinically and statistically significant in the 127 patients treated by High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) (P = .02), compared to those treated with mechanical or non-invasive ventilation at tertiary care hospitals. In this group, ZYESAMI‚Ñ¢ patients had a 71% chance of successful recovery by day 28 vs. 48% in the placebo group (P = .017) and a 75% rate of successful recovery by day 60 vs. 55% in the placebo group (P = .036). ¬†Eighty-four percent (84%) of HFNC patients treated at tertiary medical centers with ZYESAMI‚Ñ¢ survived to day 60 compared with 60% of those treated with placebo (P = .007).",RLFTF,1.0,1617023490,sleepyfishingbear

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

99,mfpde6,"A [contract for difference](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp) (CFD)¬†is a contract between a buyer and a seller that stipulates that the buyer must pay the seller the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at contract time. CFDs allow traders and¬†investors an opportunity to profit¬†from price movement without owning the underlying assets. The value of a CFD contract does not consider the asset's underlying value: only the price change¬†between the trade entry and exit. 

More info [here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp)

And btw: Us mere retail guys don't get to play in that realm, but I'm not convinced you can't just synthesize a CFD from buying a call + selling a put (or vice versa.)
