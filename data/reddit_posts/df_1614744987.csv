42,lwl6ql,"Rising Wedge on MU hourly chart.

**Shares of several semiconductor and chip companies are trading lower as tech stocks dip following yesterday's strength. The semiconductor and chip sector has gained recently amid concerns of a global chip shortage.**

We are currently sitting on support preparing to bounce. Before we bounce, we need to see a confirmation candle follow the recent candle on the hourly chart. 

After higher highs, enter half size position; buy other half once we get past the 93.00 range.

Simple swing trade, let's see how it goes these next few days.

**Target: 95.95**
