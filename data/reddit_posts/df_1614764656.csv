Renewal  energy sector is down 5% YtoD while broader market is hovering near all time high. It has dropped so much that even the old oil giant didn’t take this kind of beating. What else m I missing here? It is all but certain that the infrastructure plan will be loaded with renealblw energy projects, so why is the sector being hit so badly? 

I get teh narrative of what’s happened in Texas is causing some negative press, but that doesn’t change the fact that the future of energy will be dominated by renewable. Any negative factor I am not seeing? Maybe raw material shortage also hurt the sector?

39,lwqbmb,"TLDR: PLTR June 18th 2021 C, 30 strike price.

Firstly thanks for the free tendies @  u/The_Big_Short_2020  50 usd to 1500 usd in three days (screenshot can be attached to post as proof if needed) has been a great ride, and will be executing the 26.50 call options friday into shares (most likely, will update if I dont).

Now that I got a taste for making money, instead of lurking wsb for the last months and loosing money, I decided to post my plays here and here if the first rtard play.

Based on everything Ive seen recently about PLTR (and holding shares for the past 2 months). I decided to get in PLTR call options. Honestly, I have no idea whats PLTR planning in the next coming month, they have some great new partnerships and some awesome (long-term) projects in the pipeline. I have been seeing alot of great DD on PLTR in the sub and others. Other DD suggests that the market cap is way too high for the revenue they are generating. I believe that fundamentals are not the biggest factor anymore, now that all of us got our stim checks, and are yoloing money at shares that never had great fundamentals. True, PLTR may be overvalued, but name a silicon valley company that is not? Furthermore, PLTR is a company that actually has value.  


The play:

Right now the options are going for cheap. The share price has sunk down, after GME gang started loosing money and wsb went quiet. However, we are seeing bullish trends in the entire market, and specifically on the shares this sub is interested in.  
Around Feb 1 the stock was trading at 31 usd and then continued to YTD High of 38 usd on Feb 9th, just lagging behind GME's ATH.   
I suspect that with the new RKT and GME gang making money, they are gonna be just as retarded as me and gonna slowly start cashing out and be just as greedy to find the next play. Unfortunately there is a lack of DD posts and GME and RKT are now flooding wsb, but there has been a steady stream of wsbers buying Palantir stock and call options.

Im buying the call options at 30.00 expiring june 18th 2021, if they are even slightly in the money, I will execute the options. In the big change I am wrong and full of shit, the loss will be minimal.  I am not yoloing my NW but just looking to make some extra.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, I just HATE the company

As you can see from my post history, I've been following this trade since Gabriel Fucking Grego, aka fraudolent company slayer, posted his short thesis on the stock. Yes the stock IS overvalued, but what isn't at the current market level? So let's look at another thing: LAWSUITS.  


This is a list of lawsuits that come up just in the first page of Google results, and many more to come since I get alerts everyday. In your experience, have you ever witnessed a stock trading during numerous lawsuits that didn't go down? What happens when the lawsuits start? Of course I'm asking this from a statistical POV and from your own experience
