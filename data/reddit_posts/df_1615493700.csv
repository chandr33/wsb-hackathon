2,m2zn9j,"I see people selling on the highs and buying back in the dips. Standard practice for standard stock. With GME my impression is just HODL, and if there are any transactions to be made they should only be ‚Äúbuy more on the dips‚Äù from ladder attacks, panic sellers, etc. Or buy more because you just sold a kidney and have $$$ laying around. Technically a üíéüôå should do just that - HODL, but I see posts where people sell at the peak and buy at the dip effectively doubling or increasing their positions (nobody mentions if it‚Äôs missionary, doggy style or reverse cowgirl). That‚Äôs great they‚Äôre making profit, but ultimately is that a mechanism for the shorts to slowly regain ground? We‚Äôre retarded and can do this all day long 24/7 until payday (most of us), but after 10 years of this will the shorts cover? Or are they so far underwater that they could mathematically never recover? Mathematically sounds expensive.

I'm looking for advice on how to interpret the data, and not financial advice.

I want to know if I've got the right or wrong end of the stick.

We all know how $GME and the alike started - Reddit noticed high amount of shorting, bought the stock up to hurt the shorters, and here we are today.

I noticed using [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) one particular stock [EBKDY](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/OTCMKTS/EBKDY/short-interest/) is(?) being shorted by an increase of %32,000+

Again - Not asking for *financial* advice. 

Using $GME as the example, am I right in thinking the ""similar"" move would be to buy stock, and take it away from the shorters, therefore potentially increasing my return on investment.

Taseko Mining Company $TGB is a rather undervalued mining company that is due for a nice bit of news soon. They‚Äôve been attempting to open a large copper mine in Florence, AZ and all opposition to it is mostly gone and they simply await the Federal permit before opening it.

They completed an offering to wipe out their debt and enable them to open the mine mostly by themselves, had a great earnings report and have stayed strong in the mid 1$ range. Because of the value of copper and the potency of this mine, it seems this is extremely undervalued and when the permit news comes she should rocket a bit. I‚Äôm personally holding this one for the long haul but the news in the short term makes it a nice short term play as well. This could be an easy 5-6 bagger in a few months. Copper is surging at an all time high and is only expected to get higher.

25,m2zqj7,"So most options are [never exercised](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/closing-option-position/). they are expired OTM 20%, closed 70%, leaving only about 10% exercised. This leaves the option writer free to release/sell his shares the following week from the previous weeks he should have been acquiring as the call option goes ITM and the %delta increases. When you close your position you add downward pressure on the price last minutes before expiration. In addition you release the writers obligation to hold and deliver shares.

So let's consider a few days before expiration and assuming your options are well into the money. You would love to EXERCISE your option but it requires too much money so instead of closing the option, you lock into that price peak with a SHORT SALE.  This enhances the gamma squeeze #2 by causing your broker to find available shares for you to short.  

Now you have cash to EXERCISE your ITM option.  This will cause a huge change in the expected % (most )not exercising their ITM options, causing another extended gamma squeeze #3. The writers now need to deliver shares to the exercised holder immediately. 

The following week, at your leisure you now can deliver those shares to your open short position regardless of the price changes of the stock.  I need to confirm that this is doable with your account, closing your open short with shares in your account.

Last time I posted this, it was deleted and I'm not sure why.  Perhaps I need to say that this is not financial advice or market manipulation.  I would just want to open this idea up for discussion among option holders to see if it's possible and would it have a better prolonged gamma effect? 

Don't just trash this idea because part of it involves a short trade. The short trade supplants the need to close your option position.  You place the short trade at a high price so you are not slamming down the price the way a short attack would. 

Once again, this is not financial advice or manipulation.  Would like to open discussion if it helps a gamma squeeze.",Alternative move for option holders InTheMoney to increase Gamma Squeeze,1.0,1615493973,wallstreetwhiskers

There's a history of SEC investigations, executive convictions, and hopefully they're going to have to start paying a $15 minimum wage which should eat into profits.

Lets start at Roblox itself.
150 million active users mostly children which is growing by circa 40 million per year.
By monetizing in game items they create most of their revenue.  

Pros
1 Obviously a growing game community

2 potential for growth and generating new forms of income through the game in various ways.

3 huge market sentiment as for obvious reasons 

4 Directly listed on the market.

5 if u buy now and it will continue to rise u are happy and if u dont buy u will feel like you missed out.

6 in game item buying creates obligation.
If u potentially spent 100s of dollars on a character most likely u gonna keep on doing so and keep playing it.
7 ARK bought it.

Cons,
1Its a game. Its not facebook its a game.
And as you are investing in a game u can naturally think of some risk of investing in it on a longer term as of now its still growing. But this is really important to take in account it can simply get outdated kids might jump over to a new game for whatever reason. To say this is still big in 5 years from now is impossible to say also and mainly for next.

2 Mainly children play it. Because of their main community consisting of children it makes it hugely volatile and unsure in the future if this game fails in anyway to hold the attention its game over. Kids dont give a shit about all the money their parents spent. Pshylogical aspect they do care about their character 

3 they are still losing money although this should change and is not that dramatic and weird for a relatively new company.
U need to think of the constant developing to the game that needs to happen to keep their community intrested and happy. Although that is a good thing its also a continous high expense which will not go away.
The reason they are going public is to raise money for this sole reason developing. See CEO interview.

4 direct listing for unknown reasons they chose to do so. I personally think they did so because they are a bit cash short. Anyway direct listing meant for sure a higher trading price which is not weird at all and says nothing on first trading day. Also keep taking market sentiment in account. Me you your momma your daddy.

That ARK bought it says nothing but that they see some future in it. this move might be long anticipated and unknown whos involved and ins and outs. Remember that it did not went IPO.

Please dont buy because of somebody else rationalise yourself and suit your best tactics and research and if that happens to be the same thats ok then atleast u thought for yourself and are more sure of your next steps.

The strategy for me.
In my opinion this is going on a downtrend to potentially 55 range before moving back up.
I will at least wait a month and see if any downtrend unfolds if it does not, i will buy only if there are clear bullish signals.

Thank you for reading if u did so and i hope it helped you with your tactics.

This is the way.

- this causes a huge price uptick and draws attention from  retailers, sucking them in on FOMO and greed.
- this also allows them to cover a heavy amount of short positions at the price they bought it at if necessary. Not at $100,420.69

Step 2: Buy more meme stonks. Start a new hype craze by the rapid upward price.
- they are still buying it for less than retailers because they know retailers will FOMO in.

Step 3: Once the IV is through the fuckin roof, sell tons of options.

Step 4: Establish a new high short position. They control the peak because they were the whales largely responsible for driving it up.

Step 5: Dump a ton of shares and tank the price. We saw this on Wednesday. Once sold down to a sizeable delta, they then close out on short positions established at their peak. We have data showing 900,000 shares become available to short right after the price ""recovery"". Which means someone covered a fuckton of short shares.

Step 6: Control price til option expiry. They want the price to go sideways until all of their written options expire OTM.

Step 7: Repeat.

They are in no short squeeze danger because they own a ton of the float. There is no one driving the price up but themselves and the weak collective of retail hooked in.

 The real threats to them would be the following:
1) The rest of the world jumping in and actually throwing in enough capital to squeeze them to a margin call
2) Retail selling EVERYTHING before they do.
3) a whale bigger than them wanting to get into this game.

They know the first two likely won't happen. They influence the media to help ensure the first one. They count on retail fomo and diamond handing to not worry about the second option. The third option likely hasn't happened because most institutions with billions of capital probably don't want to risk it going to war with other MAJOR HFs. Keep in mind Citadel is backing Melvin and has a retarded amount of capital. Who wants to risky their own ass to support retail and F with those other big players? And also risk SEC investigations. No, those whales are staying away.

So. Ask yourself, is diamond handing and FDing options the right play? Or is retail just being dragged through the mud and diamond handing actually their downfall?

Some lucky individuals will cash out some profits, but likely at the expense of other retailers.

This is what I believe is happening. And my guess to confirm my suspicions is that we see this price continue to go sideways through tomorrow so all the 3/12 expirys can fall OTM.

They may repeat the process next week, or dump everything they own right before QW, either way I don't see them leaving themselves wide open to be F'd by retailers.

86,m2zz8z,"I read 122% for institutional ownership with 27% held by insiders.  So even assuming zero retail investors (filthy lie), institutions could only own 73% of the shares. 

With 69.75M shares outstanding, we subtract insiders 27% (18.8M) roughly 50.9M real shares.
Presuming 10% retail, their real shares would be 100%-27%-10%=63%.  63% of 69.75M is 43.9M.

Summarizing assumption of 10% retail:
69.75M shares
50.9M out in the world
6.9M owned by retail
‚Äî-
43.9M real shares owned by institutions
80.5M (122%) reported by institutions
36.6M fabricated shares by institutions

(The fake shares goes up if the percent of retail investors is higher, because there‚Äôs less real stock institutions could actually own.)

Yahoo Finance reports an average trading volume of 42.3M, but at least 36.6M of it is likely NOT EVEN REAL SHARES.  So at most, likely only 6M shares even being traded by apes.  Meaning as much as 36.6/4.3 = 5/6= minimum 83% of the daily movement is likely market manipulation by the hedges.  This means that most apes are hodling while the hedges engage in blatant price manipulation.

Now, the thesis is this: 

Short Interest did not cause this second price surge and it is likely in the 30% of float range (like that jargon don't ya? even added a percentage symbol, impressive, I know). A Gamma Squeeze did it. Apes smarter than me can and have explained that already on here ad naseum (oh boy Latin?) 

Now here's the juicy shit, we can, as George suggests, manufacture these. George uses the eample of just 10,000 of us yolo'ing a grand on some calls of a random stock could initiate a Gamma Squeeze as call sellers hedge (I really hate that word, I dunno why, It confuses me) by buying up shares. 

Imagine if 1 milly of our 9 got an, I dunno, $1,400 check in the mail and yeet'd that into a trading account and used it to buy RBLX calls (when they become available, if?). 

This could be the dawn of a new era of trading. 

What we need to begin doing is identifying stocks with regular normal catalysts to send it up 2% like your grandpa likes and buy every last motherfucking call option we can get our grubby hands on. This will manufacture Gamma Squeezes on stocks as institutional investors race to cover their calls, like they normally and rationally do, and then boom we sell our call options and then move on to the next one. 

I mean theoretically, we could do this with every stock in the market if we wanted to, we could do it until Congress bans options trading. So Lets.",We can manufacture Gamma Squeezes,1.0,1615494742,Ch_IV_TheGoodYears
