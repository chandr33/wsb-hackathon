39,m3131m,"Hi guys, your daily pumper here.  


It's looking like the downtrend is over and we are in the recovery phase. It has been a long 6-week downtrend but I'm happy we stopped out at \~9 USD and have a green week. We got above $10 nicely and now it's \~$11 we are fighting for. A lot of open interest at $11 so I am hopeful that those who have the cash to buy stock will pump it up so tomorrow's contracts may be in the money. I think we can secure $11 tomorrow, today we are up over 3% on the LOWEST volume day we've had in 2 months. Crazy. People are buying and holding. I like that. That being said I would not be shocked to see it red tomorrow and retest $10. RSI is close to overbought on the hourly but the Bollinger bands are VERY tight. Might be a signal to break out. Hard to say what happens tomorrow.   


Why is my line at 14.44 significant?  
That's where the dead-cat/falling knife bounce happened. A lot of shares were purchased/sold at that time and it acted as resistance shortly after, and again a few days later. If \~14.44 is secured, and if we retrace and it acts as support, then the bull trend will continue. If not then we might be in trouble and could be a false rally. 

I don't believe this will happen, there's a lot of eyes on BB and their upcoming financials and the latest news about BB working with AWS cloud infrastructure in the government in my opinion is a license to print money, and institutions wanna know how much money BB received from Huwaei and FB.  
RSI on the daily and 4-hour charts are looking healthy.   
I'd like the Bollinger bands to contract a bit more but hey, that's fine with me if it holds the smaller upwards trendline.

Cybersecurity is a major threat and only gets worse as days go on, BB is best in class in this aspect.

Keep holding my friends, you're in a great position if you bought or averaged down in the last week.  
Take care.

Long time lurker. You guys have helped me so much, now its my turn to give back a little.

**Before we get started, let me know if this is the wrong flair so I can change it. Don't wanna piss off the mods anymore than they already are.**

I'm no programmer, and I'd hardly call working in Google Sheets ""coding"", but I did some cool shit (at least I think so) and it's helped me track my options trades over the past few years.

Recently I've updated the document to cover the next 3 years.

**Only edit the following cells:**

* **Orange cells**
* **Close Date**
* **Sell Date**
* **Green Cells in the ""Approximate Expenses"" area.**

Some nifty things this doc does:

* Calculates average P/L per day/week/month/year (only based on realized gains)
* Calculates Average Yearly Return Percentage (based on the 3 years the file covers)
* Graphs P/L over the course of the file
* Tells you your monthly P/L (realized)
* Tracks portfolio stock percentages
* Calculates cost basis, taking into account profits/losses from options on that stock
* Tells you how much money you need to have to survive based on your current yearly expenses.

If you decide to dive into the cells themselves it will be pretty evident that (again) **I suck at coding.....**

But it works. So here are some random pictures for you smooth brains:

75,m31ab6,"For starters, the core of this thesis relies on an emerging understanding of the Gamma Squeeze as a market maneuver. There are two great Forbes articles on the phenomenon examining the role gamma played in driving up the price of GME in the initial surge and the current upswing. They were circulated pretty widely in the sub, so just including links below as a refresher. 

[Part 1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/?sh=55a4f63e25d0)

[Part 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/)

I know most of you are more or less illiterate, so basically what you need to know is that buying a crush of call options drives up the price of the underlying asset as various other market parties like market makers or short positions to purchase shares of the security to hedge their positions. 

It's important to underscore that, while the term short squeeze seems to be used by every 15 year old TikTok brat in the comments claiming his new penny stock is ripe for a short squeeze, the effects of a gamma swarm are indeed compounded by targeting securities with large short positions as large upward trajectory in the price forces them. 

It's particularly difficult for institutional investors to combat the gamma squeeze because, well it's a new maneuver. There's more on this in the article, but basically WSB became so powerful that when the individual retail investors that make up this community agree that a given security is undervalued, we have the power to drive up the price. 

By now, your eyes have probably glazed over and drool is dripping from your mouth because words, so here are some rockets and an ape to bring you back to life. 

So why RKT among the smorgasbord of other options? A few reasons: 

**Rockets underlying businesses are thriving and eating up market share**

There has been an enormous volume of RKT DD in the past month so not going to rehash everything here. Basically, its an excellent business disrupting a gigantic market. If you like to read, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_on_an_undervalued_gem/) is one of my favorites. A very comprehensive rundown on the state of the business. 

**Who wears short shorts? RKT wears short shorts**

Currently, RKT is short 36% of float. This isn’t the astronomical volume we saw with GME but its dry tinder in the fire of a gamma swarm. Outrageous short interest has artificially depressed the price of a company that's been crushing its execution, accumulating significant cash reserves, and buying back its own stock. As many of you already know, it even offered a 25% dividend just last week. 

RKT has the fundamentals to be an excellent long term hold, is hugely deserving of a higher price, and it's ripe for a gamma squeeze as call option volume is already significantly elevated above average. 

**Major players are sympathetic to the cause**

Something widely discussed during the initial RKT surge was how many institutional investors and big names, including the entire RKT leadership team, absolutely despise the shorts. They are ready, willing and able to support a permanent upswing and have quire literally taken steps to catalyze it, including their recent dividend. As I noted, many much smarter apes have written about this and Im happy to link you along. 

**Whats the play?**

The play would be for retail traders - perhaps with an influx of cash - to do their own DD and determine whether they think RKT has value. Assuming a few thousand of them do they do, a crush of call options in 3/19 and 3/26 EXPY would ravage short positions currently paying an 80% trading cost and catalyze massive buying from MM’s.
