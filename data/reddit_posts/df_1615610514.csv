Ok, this DD is to analyze what apes could've done better, and how to address it

""***The stock will hit 300 they said... we have volume behind us they said... buy near ITM calls they said.""*** /u/baturu

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3re9y/the\_stock\_will\_hit\_300\_they\_said\_we\_have\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3re9y/the_stock_will_hit_300_they_said_we_have_volume/)

I've just noticed the OP of that lost porn did send me a pm, but I didn't reply.(my bad) 

To be clear, here's a quote from my Donkey Kong DD, Monday Morning 3/8

""***🦍 🦍 🦍 optimize your stimmy 🍌🍌🍌, $GME gamma squeeze calculator update""***

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0eeav/optimize\_your\_stimmy\_gme\_gamma\_squeeze\_calculator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0eeav/optimize_your_stimmy_gme_gamma_squeeze_calculator/)

&gt;The 3/12 270C, if apes were to buy one contract, 3.04 x 100 = $304, then MMs would need to hedge 0.137x100x137.74 = $1882 worth of shares to remain delta neutral  
&gt;  
&gt;Giving an amplification factor of  
&gt;  
&gt;1 🍌 -&gt; 6 🍌  
&gt;  
&gt;***OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO-ers 🦍 , but carry very high risk of 🦍 loosing all 🍌, if 3/12 closing price ends below 270. A safer way for 🦍, would probably be ITM calls, somewhere around the 100-110C strike price***  
&gt;  
&gt;This would still gives 1 🍌 -&gt; 3 🍌 in delta hedge amplification

The 270C 3/12 was then quoted by the Forbes article on gamma swarm, Wednesday Night 3/10

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=6af3a3a64225](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=6af3a3a64225)

&gt;Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12. The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share. It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk. They would have covered, hedged, by purchasing shares – adding to the surge. Gamma power!\]

What most of you degenerates did was this instead

&gt;800	-207.69%	0.4	0.41	0.41	0.41	-1.93	-82.48%	27,536	29,496	0.93	860.47%	Call	3/11/2021  
&gt;  
&gt;800	-202.46%	0.01	0.01	0.01	0.01	-2.33	-99.57%	76,466	36,239	2.11	615.31%	Call	3/12/2021

G'damn degenerates piling into the 800C 3/12; Look, that far OTM have too low delta to trigger MMs forced buying. 🦍🦍🦍, is not every day you can trigger the gamma squeeze, some brokers are even actively trying to block it as seen by this post from an ape being blocked buying calls and puts by his broker of fear triggering a gamma squeeze. 

***""🛸🛸🛸Tinfoil Hats Required 🛸🛸🛸""*** u/Heavy-Ad-2498 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3yews/tinfoil\_hats\_required/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3yews/tinfoil_hats_required/) 

&gt;In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze????

They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX, but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME.

 Looking at this graph, the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19 

https://preview.redd.it/68ultrl34qm61.jpg?width=755&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fdcd61bd77cda27ed76e7f7b7e2a54aaf6e0c25

and with it the gamma amplification affect. With the 3/12 gone, that's almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there's still a chance for gamma.

I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don't know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.

https://preview.redd.it/3rut9av74qm61.jpg?width=685&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f835a0daa0f4f1236f9b5302458a4b2ae21afc

The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.

Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY, she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\

https://preview.redd.it/4yahdek94qm61.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04baf8fe07260d2a5468a9c84bf8f7ac96e1f7c4

According to her : ""blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it's trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. **so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is &lt;50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts""**

I can't comment on the business transformation, I'm not an e-commerce expert, I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take \~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry. 

With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around \~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that's about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)

# TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.","$GME DD, Friday OPEX 3/12 post mortem, WARNING Gamma decrease",1.0,1615611420,indonesian_activist

**TDLR**:  CEO of UWMC, who won Bball national championship with Michigan State,  went to war with RKT. RKT responded by buying naming rights for Michigan  State BB team. New name ""Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket  mortgage....

Alright so I have  been a long time holder of RKT and have played with UWMC. With Billions  being delayed I have more free time to watch real life.

**Step 1:** Mat Plays for Michigan State.

So  Mat was a walk on that made the team as a glorified water boy. Not that  there is anything wrong with that. He put in his dues, cleaned up  locker rooms, and got himself a National Championship ring! So that is  sweet who does not want one of those. Mat is a loyal alumi and donates  lots of money.

**Step 2:** Dan Gilbert also goes to Michigan State....

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 3. Gauntlet is tossed down.**

Mat  hops on facebook live (looking high as hell... good for him) and tells  all his clients ""it us or them... ARE YOU ALL IN"" and has his clients  sign a contract that they will not deal with RKT. (None of my links will  post)

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with.

So, maybe rather than being emotional about this, everybody should try to be a little bit clearheaded, listen to the arguments we're putting forth. You don't agree with them, you want to stay long the stock, you want to buy the stock, great. But if you're going to try to target us just because we're saying things that are not nice about a given company, well, then you know, we're gonna protect ourselves and possibly even look to capitalize on that kind of insanity.’”

In all honesty I don’t know what to make of it. All I know is fuck these guys. Fuck the HF’s and shorts. There’s a special place in hell for them. Just be aware that they’re manipulating the market, and will continue manipulating. We just have to beat them at their own game.

That being said, I would like to bring some attention to the following:

. Constellation (DAG)
. Lattice (LTX)
. Verasity (VRA)
. Sentivate (SNTVT)

In the last 6 weeks my initial investments return on this coin have been multiplied 15 times. If you have the time take a look at them. One of them is the ONLY coin that has a contract with the US Air force and the Navy. Word of caution, SNTVT is about to do a swap in the up coming weeks, so I would wait to buy till after the swap.
They can all be found on KuCoin.

That being said, do your own research. I’ve made some $$ from your suggestions here, so I thought I share this with you all.

May you all be blessed in your investments.",Bringing some attention to the following:,1.0,1615614061,IsmaelMedina3

89,m405ip,"You know what fellow 'tards.... I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe and promote the notion that at current MC of \~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc. etc.

 \-  well you know what  

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses as much as GME)

 Market  is forward looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports; betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com) link below // ); 

I only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions; some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" 

To the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches... and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)

99,m408ds,"My fellow apes,



This time last year my world was turned upside down. Covid was taking the nation by storm, the realization that things were going to be very different had almost set in, and I had no clue of the hardships to come. 

My father died on March 19th of last year from Covid. He lived In Manhattan, was 57 , a Lawyer and an amazing Father/Role Model. 

Long story short, 2020 was the worst year of my life. Out of work, emotionally spent, I wasn't sure what to do with myself. With so much free time being a blessing and a curse, I decided to put my time to good use. My intro to investing is as cliche as any, I downloaded RH after seeing it advertised in a YT video. I had always been interested in finance/investing but thought I wouldn't ever be able to understand it. 

Being a smooth brain ape with ADHD , I am all or nothing with my hobbies. If it is something that interests me , I have a hard time doing it in moderation. I watched videos,  listened to podcasts, scowered through WSB and other reddit threads. I finally built up the confidence to buy some stonks. What a rush....

I really like $GME. Besides all the wonderful DD I see on here, I have intuition and a gut feeling that this will be something big... I can feel history in the making. Next week there is the quad witching day, GME earnings which will be fire, New rule and XRT reset. I see a huge squeeze coming, gamma and SS.

So months later here I am.... currently hodling 21 shares of $GME at 159. The potential to turn this money into a nest egg for my family has me unable to sleep as of late. My father worked hard and we are Financially stable for now, but I want to provide for them so we never have to work like slaves again. After all the hurt and the trauma, we all deserve a comfortable life. 



FUCK THE HEDGIES, FUCK CITADEL, FUCK KEN GRIFFIN, FUCK MELVIN, FUCK PORTNOY, FUCK THE SEC, FUCK ANYONE WHO GOES AGAINST MY FELLOW APES. I TRUST YOU ALL WITH MY LIFE!
