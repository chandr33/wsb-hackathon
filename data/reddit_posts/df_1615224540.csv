# IS GE THE SAME AS GME?

Not the same, but share some similar characteristics

* Both stock have been beaten down into oblivion (See comparison chart below)
* Before DFV, who the fuck invests in GME? Now, who the fuck invests in GE?
* Both stock have HIGH upside when it is consolidating at the bottom
* Both stock have special external conditions that make it an interesting R / R play
* GME was over shorted and had fresh talent take over from CHEWY
* GE  is in a special moment in US history when an Infrastructure Bill by the  Gov could pave the way for a turnaround for General Electric (more on  that later)

# TECHNICALS

My  primary reasoning for this bet is in the charts, which are  self-explanatory with pretty crayon coloring. I’ve simplified it  tremendously and only highlighted important stuff.

# (SPECULATIVE) FUNDAMENTALS

Aside  from the technical, I’m also BETTING that the Post Pandemic era is  going to send this stock back up to test previous highs.

1. Pandemic - For obvious reasons, people getting sick and dying increases demand in the entire healthcare sector.
2. Post Pandemic – Travel industry will recover, which means GE Aviation demand will rise
3. US  Power grid issues – GE is the OG in this space (remember Edison General  Electric Company? I don't). They laid the foundation for America’s  power grid back before our great grandparents were hipsters.

`SPECULATION ON INFRASTRUCTURE BILL`–JPOW and his goons are on a printing spree. With California fires the  last 6 years and Texas power grid chaos this year, it is OBVIOUS (to me)  we need to UPGRADE OUR POWER GRID INFRASTRUCTURE. What better way to do  that than to inject TRILLIONS into the sector through an INFRASTRUCTURE  BILL, which not only addresses our power problem but generate jobs and  get America back on it’s feet? This means an upgrade to our power grid  to provide more reliable power when we need it the most (i.e weather  extremities) with an emphasis on sustainability and being more eco  friendly (Greta probably approves) . GE is poised to be the biggest  player for this task as they have the capacity and experience to do the  job. On a side note, if an infrastructure bill passes, it’ll be more  than GE that benefits from the bill.

44,m0l1o4,"Alright Apes, I think we’ve got a big one here. Found something interesting while lurking the big brains in r/options over the weekend and decided to investigate further. I like to do some research so I don’t go into withdrawal while the markets are closed… I really hate that you can only lose money 5 days a week, but I digress. 

I’ve read some fantastic DD about the anomaly of gamma squeezes in the last few weeks, obviously with $GME being the primary example, but $RKT was another (much shorter term) great lesson in how the put-to-call ratio combined with a strong catalyst can create massive run up in a stock. I have learned that there seems to be a pretty consistent formula to the moon. Many of you already know this, but I’ll reiterate the math: 

(a good company) + (high short interest) + (bullish options chain) + (catalyst) = 🚀

I like to think of the company as the wood, short interest and put-to-call ratio as the jet fuel, and a catalyst (new information or events) as the match. We’ll come back to this.


Part One: Going Long

$GOGO is an in-flight internet service provider. I want to start by saying that I love this stock long term for a ton of reasons. From a sentiment perspective, I am massively bullish on travel now that things are looking up on the vaccine front, and I have increased my positions in reopening stocks accordingly. 

Financials

* Recent sale of the cash sucking &amp; competitive commercial side of the business was much needed and debt will come down significantly
* Remaining private aviation business is basically a monopoly, and has customers that are quite insensitive to price increases. Private flights will soar post-pandemic, and we are in an era where connectivity is essential
* Operating income of $22M in Q3, at a time when nobody was flying, is insanely good. That’s $90M operating income annualized in the middle of a pandemic with basically zero travel
* Let’s conservatively call it $200M (Ann.) of operating income once things return to normal and $80M (Ann.) of interest expense... maybe $40M capex... that’s $80M cash flow for a $1B company, a 12 multiple.
* Trading at 12x cash flow in a growing industry is one of the cheapest prices for a growth company you can find anywhere

With NO OTHER INFLUENCE, based on valuation and performance alone, my price target for this stock is $16. But there’s more to the story… and they report earnings THIS THURSDAY


Part Two: Squeezus take the wheel

There are two components that make a good rocket fuel, and this time we’ve been treated to the 420.69 octane, high quality, primo NASA fuckin moon mix. 

Short Interest: 

- 40.05% of float (as of Feb. 11)
- -8% since last reported (means shorts are starting to close positions)

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GOGO

Options Chain:

Now FEAST YOUR EYES on what’s got me harder than my wife’s boyfriend on his birthday. The call to put ratio is BANANAS. 66:1!?!?!? AM I DREAMING???? There are 43,143 calls vs. 696 puts expiring in the near term. BULLISH. AS. FUCK. https://i.imgur.com/b3xeeYE.png

$RKT was 10:1 calls to puts before it blasted off. Just sayin.


Part Three: The Big Bang

So we’ve got a solid company with good prospects for the future, high (but decreasing) short interest, and an insanely bullish options chain. We just need that spark baby, and there are a few:

* Rumblings that there’s a large player gobbling up shares left right and centre for the last 3-4 months. The company has delayed announcement of a refi plan that has been in the works for some time. I believe there could be a large announcement at earnings call Thursday. POTENTIALLY EVEN AN ACQUISITION. 
* Also a high expectation of beating earnings, based on Zack’s research of analyst ratings. Basically saying that several indicators show that some analysts might know something, and have taken a more bullish stance on $GOGO before earnings. This alone should drive up the share price if they beat expectations https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gogo-gogo-expected-beat-earnings-173005394.html


TL;DRIf this thing pops off like I expect it to, OTM call options will be triggered, forcing sellers to buy shares and cover these positions. This triggers MORE OTM calls, driving the price up even more, rinse &amp; repeat. It ALSO happens to put pressure on the heavy short positions right before Q1 closes out. 

I might have a smooth brain, but when I see an overwhelmingly bullish outlook, I BUY ALL FUCKING DAY. Somebody knows something here and I plan to be in the middle of it. Would love to see some more DD from others on this. To the moon retards 🚀🌙

48,m0l20k,"Was thinking:

1) marketcap is math operation price x shares and it is old finance index to compare companies. 

Actually we are using it as substitute for normalization, to compare ""theoretic asset total value perceived by the market"" in a given moment. 

This is because we can't compare directly prices for assets with different supplies. BUT: marketcap is price\*shares/tokens so it is a math operation consequence.

Price is the moving factor, shares/tokens is constant, so marketcap is a variable dependent on price. NOT THE CONTRARY.

2) marketcap isn't money spent in assets: I have 10000 lemon tree that I sell all to my uncle for 1 dollar each. Lemon trees: 10k marketcap. Overnight he sell 3 of them for 10 dollar each.

lemon trees: 100k marketcap. There were 30 dollar spent in total, marketcap increased 10x. 

Marketcap moves easily, not money needed for it to change. We can add more: price moves even for news, order book movements, rumours and so on, so not much trades are needed to drastically change a mcap.

3) Claims such as: ""it's impossible for ADA to reach 100 dollars!!!! mcap would be too much!!!"" are just like those yelling B.itcoin at 1000 dollar was too high.

Derivatives markets are in the order of quadrilions; real estate are multitrillion range, commodities too, stock giant too.

so why isn't possible for cr.ypto (revolutionary tech which is getting in the whole financial system) to be at least 10 trillion in total asset cumulative value?

with 10T cr.ypto total mcap, B.itcoin dominance of 50% and ADA dominance of 5% we'd have at least 500billion mcap ADA, with a price of 15 dollars.

Gold alone, 1 single commodity has 12 T mcap. B.TC aims to replace gold at 12T alone.

4) price action is dependent on demand and offer but also on utility. 

for instance: BNB burning their token: lowering supply, demand stable ---&gt; price increase

for instance: e.thereum infinite supply but token perceived as useful (gas for florid network) ---&gt; price increase 

for instance: B.itcoin supply is stable, demand is rising ---&gt; price increase

for instance: ADA supply is stable, demand is rising, token perceived as useful (governance for florid network) ---&gt; price increase ++++

5) timeframe: of course a 100$ price which spikes in 1 day isn't sustainable, that would put too many investors in gain position of +1000% or more.

But as time passes, and trades happen, the position of average trader changes and it averages on current price.

That is easy to see for price when we passed 0.10$ threshold and we are at 1$ price: 3$ was considered impossible last year because it was too much

on percentage; now it's a 3x (+300%) which is totally possible....

6) it won't be ever to 150 mcap because e.thereum is there!! (last year e.hereum mcap was 40 billion, look at mcap ADA has now....spoiler: 40 billion).

whole cr.ypto market will grow. ADA demand will rise, thanks to its max cap supply, network increase in utility, mass adoption in developing countries

and because it is innovative in lots of features most of blockchains do not have: native tokens in multiasset shared ledger, multilanguage of programming (haskell, java, blockly, marlowe, soon Solidity too,etcetera),

voting system, venture capital self-sustaining fund (Catalyst), the most peer-reviewed and secure Proof of Stake protocol (ouroboros actually going to update to ouroboros omega and ouroboros omega ++) that other chains got inspired from (polkadot)

and so on...
