\****netback is what a company makes per barrel of oil AFTER oil costs associated from getting that barrel to market.***

Small oil company with net book of \~$215M trading at \~$110M. Last PPE fair value evaluation in December. Net book is Assets - Liabilities. So essentially this is like a free business you buy. Literally. It’s like trading FOR FREE.

Oil Inventories on hand \~ $30M at netback value (so 15M extra if you subtract inventory at lower of cost or net realisable value). Giving you $245M book value market value. Now look, because here is some *trickery*: Companies (and this one) record their inventory on their balance sheet at the lower of ‘Cost or Net realisable value’. So on their books they have $17M of oil at ($18 per barrel) because that’s what their cost was.

So like another \~$30M (conservative) of money on their books. Are you drooling yet?

Debt = cash on hand. Their long term debt is $30M and their cash on hand is $30M. Super NOT leveraged. I actually wished they would take on more debt, amplifying the BOOM BOOM of their stonk later.

Too good to be true? How is this possible Daddy Raccoon?

The secret to this sauce lies here:

They got super smashed by COVID and had to offer shares to survive. Offering shares dilutes their shares and oil price was like negative a barrel at a time during COVID (no jokes go google it).

**They recently renogiated their contract in Egypt so as to DOUBLE their netback from the oil they produce there.**

The timing could not of been better. They actually renegotiated because their old contract was made like WAY back in the boomer days. Which is like, when dinosaurs still roamed the earth and there was so little oil supply because oil comes from dinos right?

(almost) All insiders have bought in the last few months.

CEO only bought $50k and earns annual compensation of 1$m? Total holdings is $365,000. So like, this is my one problem. If the CEO knows this is so dirt fucking cheap why isn’t he LOADING UP.

Although he is also incentavised with options so maybe that’s why. And \~$365K is no small sum.

With oil prices where they are currently they will make 91M$ this year in netback. Capex is 21$m for this year. That’s netback of their entire market cap - *basically.*

CEO has been with the company since 2005. Has CFA CPA and chartered accountant. Been the industry for about 20 years.

They use to struggle at Brent price of 40 but now due to the contract renegotiation with Egypt they can survive with oil at 40. How? Let me show you:

&amp;#x200B;

[On the left is oil price on the right is the Netback they make at those oil prices](https://preview.redd.it/o7o3r5j6z0m61.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cbe4a11b0e68a76f96e2f16dcfc0081b39485d6)

That shit on the right is their total netback. Although this calculation is fairly rough, I did try and take into account that their Egypt oil does less well (due to the contract) than their Canada operations.

There you have it. I don’t know what more to say.

Please, do your own DD and tear this shit apart.

45,m19jtz,"Basically, VW. 
I started my purchases 5 months ago based on the fact that by mid 2022 they will be #1 in EV sales. They are gaining market share while Tesla loses it. In Europe, which is the number one EV market, VW is now #1 in sales and Tesla has slipped to #4. Yet Tesla is worth 600B and VW is worth 130B.(but climbing). The valuations are out of whack and so I believe VW's value will cross Tesla at some point. Will it be at 150B or 300B. I have no idea, but VW sells 11.5 Million cars a year and this year will sell 700K EVs. Tesla will only sell 750K EVs and that's it. Why is one worth 5x the other. I figure the math will converge somewhere down the road. So I have bought a lot of VW stock and will hold on until they cross. It's a low risk game with a 3% dividend kicker while I wait for the inevitable. 
That's one reason, but if you want a non-EV based answer - Toyota is worth 250B and VW is only worth 130B. They are similar in size and sales, but Toyota is worth 2x. The reason is Toyota has a 15:1 PE and VW has a 8:1 PE. I think they should have the same PE and I won't sell any shares until they do.
Both are great reasons and I think both come true. So this stock is my biggest position by far. Also, IN with options. I LIKE THE STOCK, MARK MY WORDS.",THE NEW TSLA,1.0,1615305823,polpro5

I've been going in and out of GME for the last few months now.  
I wanted to share a bit of experience with you guys, to make things easier for everyone.  


Note that this is not financial advice, I'm just sharing my experience here.  


1 - Panic Selling ruins your gains.  
The biggest mistake I made during $GME is selling the stock when there were bigger drops.  
In most cases, it got pretty frustrating afterwards, when they had more profits than before. If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.  


2 - Being impatient  
This directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.  


3 - Not informing myself when to get in our out  
I always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.  


4 - Not checking out wsb  
The most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub. All the memes made me strong, we are strong together. Believe it or not, those made me less stressed  


TL;DR: Don't panic sell, be patient, inform yourself and expect a falling stock once news make fun of WSB losses and check out WSB for memes to motivate you  


Thank you dear apes for reading this. Cheers 2021 millionares and good luck in life!

- Obi-Wan Kenobi

Everybody who owns the stock hates hedge funds, was letdown af by the institutions at some point, is in on this for a wild ride of solidarity, or all of the above. 

Watching the congressional hearings and understanding how little our congress people understand about what’s going on, why equities piled onto the stock market, and the fundamentals of why these hedge funds got cornered is saddening. The hedge funds thought they were invincible and any bet they make on a business failing would come to fruition, or they would make it so. We proved them wrong. 

But the information the congresspeople are getting is clearly different than us. They do not hold the position that a stock should not be over shorted, that businesses should be protected from having 100% over their stock oversold which destroys the value of the workers and investors who believe in and live off said business.

They hold the position that individual traders can not and should not win, and should never beat Goliath. 

And that’s the crux of the issue, and that is our strength. 

Whatever decision Congress makes, we will know if they crucified DFV and if they saved the brokerages and HF’s. And if they do that, we will have lost all faith in the system. 

This isn’t about money. I mean it is, for everyone involved, but the lasting outcome of this will be about faith. The HF’s faith that they will be propped up and protected. The everyday trader’s faith that although the playing field isn’t too fair, there’s still room for them. Faith in the market, in our congresspeople.

They strike DFV down, and an entire generation will go wide eyed in anger and it will influence the way they see government, markets, regulations, forever. 

**The saddest part is that this isn’t even really about us or them. This is about liquidity issues and bad practices in the infrastructure. Brokerages fucking shit up, HF’s doing outright illegal, irresponsible shit. The government WANTS to look away. They would gladly fuck over some nobodies rather than keep big parts of their economic machine responsible and accountable.
