65,mf0rug,"I'll start by saying that I am not a financial advisor, but I pride myself on seeing things from alternative angles.

Like many, over the past few months, my eyes have been glued to the stock market. I would watch stock prices go up and down, not know what's truly going on, but I like the stock so that I would invest. Then a question came to me, what is a stock exactly? I know there is a price per stock, but where does its number come from, and what does it represent?

Then it hit me; the price comes from belief. When a lot of individuals believe and want that company to do well, the price goes up. When nobody believes in it or dislikes the company, the price goes down. At least that's the way it should play out.

We now know that there are those that like to control our beliefs by using all types of manipulating tricks. From using the media to dark pools, quite possibly more, they seek to inspire Fear Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). We like to believe we are protected from these attacks on our minds, but we are finding out that those in charge of this task have not been doing so.

This concept bleeds into so many factors of our everyday lives. 

The etymology of Government comes from the term govern. From Old French governer, derived from Latin gubernare ""to direct, rule, guide, govern,"" which is derived from the Greek kybernan (to pilot a ship). ... There is precedent that the suffix -ment is derived from the latin mente meaning mind in some languages, particularly Old French

To make that simple, Control Minds. That lead me to see Hedge Funds as a type of financial government. That is why I see this being an ape in all parts of life will be a powerful mindset to take with me in all things I do. Only together can the weak stand up and make change.

I am just some random dude trying to bring you some helpful advice in the event of a worst case scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tips for what to do you do in the event of a fire sale?

&amp;#x200B;

***A loss on a trade is only solidified when you sell***

* This may lead to the question, **How do I know when to sell?** If you have high conviction in your long term positions within your portfolio and **you still believe in them long term, Just maintain them through the fire.** Trades on stock investments only risk becoming completely worthless in the event of **Bankruptcy.** If your investment is not within reasonable risk of bankruptcy, there is a good chance it can recover. Add this to your thought process when determining if you should sell any investments.

***Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose***

* If your life is hanging in the balance on your portfolio then you need to pay close attention to the market more than anybody. Take time to really educate yourself using resources much better than I can provide, if you haven't already. Always maintain a big/long term view.
* If you are a bear waiting to **""time the drop""** then it would be safe to operate under the assumption there could always be lots of more volatility ahead. Some firesale deals may look very good on the surface, but should not stop you from conducting extensive research on them.

# If you deal with any investments that have even a remote possibility of a margin call, then you should be the ones on the highest alert

* Always assume the worst and constantly run estimates/calculations on your worst case scenarios
* if you are a **novice investor** and just said **""what does margin call mean exactly?""** then you should probably not be messing with these types of financial instruments in the first place. When I say these type of financial instruments I mean things like **Naked option contracts, covered calls, margin trading, and short selling etc.**

&amp;#x200B;

If there was any tips that are wrong or I missed please feel free to add more or correct me in the comments and I will make edits. Like I said, I am closer to an idiot than an expert, so my words should not be treated like gospel just something to consider down the road.",Please! At the very least save this post for later.

94,mf1r6j,"“We should get dinner tonight.” Brenda said to me as I gazed down at my phone on that fateful day. 

*”Dinner. Pfft. Typical. Maybe if I invested in GME, or even AMC...”* I thought to myself.
 
At the thought, I opened up my Robinhood app. My life flashed before my eyes. What I saw was truly devastating.

“Please baby, don’t go that way” I mumbled, almost unconsciously in sort of a daze. My portfolio took a hit. All i could see was red. I was sick to my stomach. My hand reached to my left, holding the nearest trash bin with a firm, steady grip. Ironically, my trash futures were what I was holding in my robinhood account. Funny how things work sometimes. My trash was down 50%.

“What did you say? Do you want to get Chick-fil-a or no?” Brenda said, kind of annoyed.

Brenda is my girlfriend. She does not understand my pain and suffering. She never has. No one possibly could. It is like birthing a child and seeing it viciously cut in half in one day. Red everywhere. My precious portfolio... my baby... In that moment, I was envious of Brenda and her ignorance.

“No one understands...” I said gravely with a subtle melancholic tone.

Brenda stormed out. Typical. 

I sat still for hours in a hypnotic state. So many questions. So little time. One question in particular was haunting me.

“Who was to blame for this substantial loss in my trash investments?” I pondered. How could such a simple question have such a complex answer? Such is life. 

Out of nowhere the answer hit me. After conducting extensive technical analysis, I met face to face with the truth. It was a tough pill to swallow at first, but the conclusion was unmistakable. I called Brenda immediately and gave her hell.
