Only been a member since the whole GME fiasco but so far u guys have led me on the right path, gotten me some nice returns, and I trust your input so I was wondering if u could help me with this. Now as we all know captain Phillips decided to Tokyo drift into the Suez Canal and as a result shipping lines are all blocked up, but there is always a positive side to anything. What would be the best way to capitalize on the situation as far as stocks go? This should last about a month so I was wondering what your thoughts were on the best stocks to invest in to take advantage of that.

The new 3 Trillion infrastructure plan will be unveiled in Pittsburgh next week on and which is music to the ears of American steel companies. Since taxpayer money is the piggy bank for this endeavor and if you know anything about government contracting you would know that the “Buy American Act” is serious business. It pretty much means that taxpayer money of this scale must be used to benefit reliable American industry/workers such as Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)

CLF has been on a buying frenzy these last few years with its most notable purchase of ArcelorMittal USA and its subsidiaries in December 2020. This has allowed for CLF to cement its place as the largest vertically integrated flat rolled steel producer in N. America. Another huge plus for all that infrastructure money coming down the pipe.

This is where Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) might just jump off the chart. As boring as steel is it's everywhere, we need it, America is literally built on the stuff. With everyone chasing SPACs and other highflyer tech companies its often the ones left behind that surprise us the most and this could be that golden goose that finally gets your wife's pesky BF out of the house. After all the cyclical market is said to be the new investing landscape. 

Steel is also the type of commodity where if its supply chain or one of the underlying components rises (which are) i.e. coal, iron ore, oil, or labor the end result will lead to a rise in unit cost which also equals $$$ in the pocket of share holders. Further, considering the vertically integrated structure of the company this only helps increase profit margins.  

In 2020 alone CLF increased its work force by 2.4k to 25k according to ""Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) - Share price, News &amp; Analysis - Simply Wall St"". This company is clearly ramping up for something big and its definitely not bankruptcy. All signs indicate that with the right investment you could buy your very own Wendy’s and the best part is the option prices are still low. Very low as a matter of fact. 

Based on all factors considered, which is EBITDA, other financials, insider share purchases, FOMO sentiment, 3 Trillion in infrastructure spending..... I'm going to call it that CLF trades for $26/share (minimum) by  April 17.

**Bonus Fact:** For every 1 trillion in infrastructure spending - according to a study from Georgetown University by Carnevale &amp; Smith - it will create 11 million jobs by 2027. That's 11,000,000 x 3 = 33,000,000 jobs!

Own the only copy of one or all 77 pieces of the original Hollywood independent film: ""We Will Rock You"" (originally ""Operation: Belvis Bash"") starring Corey Feldman and other cult favorites. This movie will NEVER be released and was censored by all corporate distributors in Hollywood. It is notorious in insider circles but unknown outside the biz. This film was shot in 2008 - 2009, and received limited screenings (5) in 2011 before being memory holed completely by 2013. In 2018 it was released briefly on Amazon by the creator only to be removed for ""objectionable"" content shortly after. Very few people have seen this film. On its 4th screening in Houston Texas, the film enjoyed 24 hours of viral news when the killing of Osama Bin Laden was announced by President Obama. Corey Feldman emerged from the theater to congratulatory phone calls and inhabited headlines for having killed Bin Laden the next day. See IMDB for details.

26,memho3,"With short interest at 44% on one page and days to cover at less than one, I do not believe a SHORT squeeze is in the cards, it can be covered with half of daily volume. They can short it to 100% and cover in a day, sad but true.

I DO however, believe the gamma squeeze remains a possibility with options expiring in the money, I think the juice for that will come with quarterly rebalancing for indexes (Wednesday is the end of Q1) and index reconstitution that happens twice a year for GICS indexes, like the S&amp;P 500 (May &amp; November).

AMC &amp; GME have moved up enough to be picked up by additional growth indexes and market cap weighted indexes (GME enough to sneak into the S&amp;P 500), to illustrate the point here's what GME needs to do to get into the S&amp;P 500, which would be tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds, in buying the indexes are required to do based on their own rules, and that would feed into the gamma play.

S&amp;P Inclusion rules:

1. Market Cap over 11.3B (Check)
2. Annual dollar value traded to a float-adjusted Market Cap is greater than 1.0 (Check)
3. Minimum monthly volume of 250k shares (Check, check, check thanks to you fucking apes).
4. Publicly listed on either the NYSE (CHECK) or NASDAQ.
5. Company from the US (CHECK)
6. Not one of the prohibited security classes (LPs, MLPs, ITs, OTC/pink sheets, closed end funds, ETFs, etc.) (CHECK)

The big issue for these two would be a committee review, that's required and could be fucked, the fact that margin is being clamped down on tells me somebody heard something from their former roommate about this not going to be the stopping factor to inclusion, so they've got to get their house in order and they have a week/2 months for various scenarios.

Since indexes are reconstituted quarterly (Wed) then there would be buying there, in theory. They have rules on inclusion like buffering (holding out until it meets criteria for a certain, predetermined length of time) and packeting (including say 20% of the current float in the index, then as it maintains it adding more, again on predetermined lengths of time).

I could see Wednesday being a good day, followed by a good Friday with a lot of options moving from OTM to ITM at expiration, then in May, those help propel to a possible S&amp;P 500 inclusion and more institutional buying.

Again, just my thoughts on why the SHORT squeeze is a pipe dream now and the GAMMA squeeze is possible still, and the big moves will come from indexes.

Basically as long as GME doesn't crash at this point, it's going up. Likely similar for AMC, options compound to the long or short side accordingly with dealer hedging to remain delta neutral (so remember when you buy puts, you fucking idiots, dealers are required to short shares in proportion to the delta of the derivative instrument at the time and rebalance daily).

Remember, do your own due diligence and I'm retarded, I eat crayons to fuel my smooth brain.","GME thoughts: Short Squeeze, na dawg, Gamma: very possible but the third thing is what interests me most: Posted in a comment but curious what you fellow smooth-brained apes think",1.0,1616878545,FCFF35

43,memsef,"Hello fellow apes just thought I’d post something as I need to pay back the Tendies this group has delivered to me. First off this is not financial advice and do your own DD. I have been watching online Currencies sinc 2015 and didn’t finally jump in due to my money at the time as I was in the Canadian Weed sector (I tend to pick a sector at a time to be a “expect” so I can make Tendies). I finally bought in after the first crash and have been adding positions/researching sinc. I wanna make a couple of points for those who are new or unsure and anyone else please add more information as this is my own opinion and view. 
First off online currencies has as much “value” as any $ as under the current fiat currency system a $ have value because we all believe a $ has value. Bcoin and many other online coins have now proven they have value and in this case  I personally believe now they will never at this point drop too 0. Could there be large corrections ...... yes and why I rarely try to time the market as I have got that wrong almost every other time I tried so I buy stuff that in my mind will go up over time just may take longer then I want. 
Second which is by design most online currencies are not controlled by any government. With the fiat currency system instead of paying down debt and making voters passed off they print more money. By doing this and based on simple supply and demand the more $ printed the less value it has as there is more of it. Look at mint condition collectibles, are they worth what is being pay ....... no In my option but the real value is the rarity of mint condition old collections. Using this logic the fact there is a steady and predicted number of coin and so even will end increases the value. To be honest this point was the one that peaked my interest originally. 
The third point is the world is changing. The world has become more a global force in business rather then individual companies. The old days of a banks making fat stacks of money converting money and making the transfers I think is dyeing. Both the governments and banks want their cut of the transfer fees and any other way to get our money and this is why they are fighting this tooth and nail. It’s not till recently that I have seen a decrease of news saying online currency’s are used only
In crime as it can’t be report. They have now switched it’s too unreliable a asset to park your money. Ever time I see a article insulting Online currencies I can’t lie I dance. To me it means they are threatened as they are worried they are losing control.
The forth and final point is online currencies will stabilize as soon as it’s more common. Currently I look at my various accounts and see how I’m up like 2000-3000%(I wish I had more money at the start but only risk what you’ve already lost in your head). I will surprised if I get another run in that small time frame again but hey you never know. I don’t mind the 1-50% day dips as I look long term and think In particular Bcoin and Ecoin will be up at the end of the day.

Well there is my ramble just as a disclosure I hold positions in the following Riot,HUTMF,DMGI,bcoin,ecoin,dcoin and my biggest position Hive as I like the stock.

The big boys HATE us, retail traders and they are trying to show who is boss lately.

It’s hard to realize that the price action recently for most stocks is not related at all to the actual company. It’s just Wall Street manipulation going up and down using the tickers to make money- that’s what you get to do when you own all the shares.

78,men89s,"Yesterday I went to the movie theater by me. We don't have an AMC here. When I walked in I noted that the arcade room in the left side was empty. My initial thought was. What a waste of space and money. I think it would make a ton of sense to replace the arcades in some movie theaters with GME stores or just add some GME stores to AMC theaters. Why would I do that?

Many people who goes to the movies are also the ones who buy GME merchandise.

If you go to visit a GME store and find out about the movies you may end up watching more movies. 

Many stores have plenty of parking. Make easy for parents to take kids to either AMC theater or GME store.

We all grow up going to the movies with our parents, friends and family. We build good memories doing that. With a GME store right there it is like all that candy in the check out lane in a supermarket. Got the spirit. What a better way to build brand loyalty than building great memories !!!

If both companies do well. We the stock holders will do well. 

I will keep trading stocks with both AMC and GME with years to come. After the squeeze happens I will likely sell covered calls and cash covered put on both and add to my positions on both with that. 

Why? Because I too like the stock !!!

But until that happens and if it happens I will continue to buying and hold on both until both squeezes come!",The GME / AMC move that just makes sense - Replace arcades with GME stores,1.0,1616880798,docstockguy

89,mencpn,"Goldman Sachs — one of two banks managing the sales — began emailing investors about the trades well before the market opened, with $6.6bn worth of stock in Baidu, Tencent Music and Vipshop on the block.

The Wall Street investment bank told counterparties that the sales were prompted by a “forced deleveraging,” a signal that a fund may have been hit with a margin call, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Goldman increased the size of the deals several times, they said.

But speculation became rampant on Wall Street as the big blocks of shares kept coming, and the stock names on offer broadened beyond Chinese groups. Some fund managers believed the fire sales indicated that a major hedge fund or family office was in trouble.",FT : Hedge fund asset firesale. Margin call?,1.0,1616881199,Quince89
