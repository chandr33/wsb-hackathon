3,m31ebg,"1) U.S. daily Covid cases are still on the decline (7-day average currently at 63.2k vs. a high of 259.6k at the start of the year)

2) I'm currently in IL and have been tracking the vaccine data, as of yesterday we are currently at 10.25% of the state fully vaccinated (more than 98.2M doses have been given in the US as a whole). I personally have started to go to the movies again (double-masking) and spent $20+ both times on overpriced concessions to help the company lol. As an AMC Stubs member I get half off on Tuesday's so that's cool I'm happy to do my part.

3) Theaters in Los Angeles are set to reopen this Saturday. 

4) AMC seems to have made a deal with WarnerMedia. CEO Adam Aron said their deal would likely reslut in lower fees they will have to pay to rent movies from the studio, thus increasing their gross margin. 

5) B. Riley raised their Price Target for AMC to $7.00/share, up from $5.50.

6) Wedbush raise their PT to $6.50/share, up from $5.00.

7) ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" comes out this month. I personally will be seeing it in theaters and again buying tendies/soda/candy before the movie starts.

31,m31ijm,"Coupang (CPNG) didn’t get as much hype as PLTR or more recently, RBLX. However, it’s impossible to ignore this amazing investment opportunity. Upon doing more research, CPNG has insane growth prospects, with a stellar management team, a delivery infrastructure that improves upon what AMZN has, and proven dominance in a hyper-competitive market, CPNG is $$$.   


**What does it do:**  
 \-CPNG is an e-commerce company based in South Korea. 

\-Unlike Amazon, CPNG has the biggest private fulfillment ecosystem in the world. This means they have more control over how they deliver: They offer free same-day delivery on retail products, and deliver food and drinks from local businesses as well. They don’t rely on a UPS or Fedex, for example, as they have their own fleet of delivery drivers. 

\-Their “Dawn Delivery” service runs overnight. Returns are free and instant. No packaging or re-boxing is necessary, and money is returned to the customer as soon as the item is scanned. 

\-They’re eco-friendly, using 75% less boxes than Amazon.

\-Market Cap: About 100-billion. 2020 Revenue was $12-bn. Has grown over 90% from 2019.   


**Competitors:**  
\-The two dominant e-commerce companies in Korea are G-Market and Coupang. Koreans overwhelmingly prefer Coupang and well over 25-million, or half the entire population has downloaded the app.

\-CPNG CEO routinely compares their performance against AMAZN and Ebay. In the future perhaps.  


**But . . . South Korea?**  
 \-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years. 

\-Also, Coupang will EXPAND. They’re quiet about it now, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle. They plan to expand throughout Asia and the United States. 

\-It’s realistic, because South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea’s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don’t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. 

\-Its why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven’t. 

\-Coupang is projected to be the leading company in Korea, but will likely take market share in the US, China, South East Asia, and South America.   
 

**Notable Investors:**  
\-Bill Ackman - Said it was one of his BEST ventures to date.

\-Softbank - has helped Coupang be the biggest Asian IPO since Alibaba. Masa Son believes this to be a long-term play.

\-Blackrock  
 \-Sequoia Capital  


**Intangibles:**  
\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma’s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.  

\-I grew up in South Korea. CPNG’s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I’ve ever seen to come out of South Korea. This guy is cut above every CEO I’ve seen in Korea—and he has the pump artist way of talking, if you know what I mean. This guy will say he “cares about his customers” and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, and now, this guy. 

\-Look at this video and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. 

\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010. 

\-Kim’s motto: I envision a world where people will say, “How could I have ever lived without Coupang”.   


**Future Direction:**  
\-They bought a major streaming company and will thus stream content (like Amazon Prime). 

\-They will further expand and improve upon their food delivery service.

\-They will expand into new territories as early as next year (see above). 

Disclosure: I bought 500 shares today, with shares now averaging around $55. Of course I should've waited, but I've tended to do well buying close to open anyway. I plan to sell covered calls against at least two or three lots, as the premiums will be very juicy once the options market opens.  


**Predictions:**   
\-My price prediction is as meaningless as a magic 8-ball, but my gut tells me this will touch $70-$80 by eoy, and $150+ within two years depending on macro factors and their improving fundamentals.

\-Also, I admit, this is a bit foolish to predict rn (but I wanna take credit if it happens lol): I’d be surprised if Cathie Wood doesn’t buy CPNG. She has a team analyzing E-commerce companies and is knee deep in Shop. I’m willing to bet she will buy CPNG some point soon because it is ""disruptive.""  


**TL;DR - As South Korea is projected to become the 3rd largest E-commerce market in the world, CPNG has proven to be he nation’s most technologically savvy and dominant e-commerce platform. The stable-genius, well-spoken, Harvard-dropout CEO, Bom Kim has ambitions to grow Coupang into the largest e-commerce company in a world that’s increasingly warming up to South Korean companies and culture.**",Coupang (CPNG) DD - Insane Growth Prospects,1.0,1615498876,jameskwonlee

78,m31rg5,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.",Don't know how to invest? Try this.,1.0,1615499559,yazoodd
