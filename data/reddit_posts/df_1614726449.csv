I posted a different version of this a few months back and rewrote the entire post today with elaborations from Livermore, because there are a lot of new traders (several million) here that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground (no offense, none of us did when we began trading) and might find some of this helpful. Enjoy!

These are some gems of wisdom from the greatest trader that ever lived. Jesse Livermore. Hedge funds make every new member read a copy of [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Operator-Investment-Strategies-Livermore/dp/B08L3XC9FV/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3R2TJ52J7E5FW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=reminiscences+of+a+stock+operator&amp;qid=1614723417&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=remi%2Cstripbooks%2C165&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzT0hISUgyMzdVUDY2JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDc1MjY2WVIxTTVRNzhXTVpSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNTMzNDIxMlNBWlZKRUtUQlU2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) because it's a firsthand look at how markets are manipulated and what actually drives stock prices.

Livermore  was the YOLO king. He started trading in his teens in [bucketshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_(stock_market)) in his home state of Massachusetts. After making 10's of thousands, he moved to NYC and worked his way up to several million.

At his peak, he had yachts, several luxury properties all over Manhattan and a yellow Rolls Royce that never had to stop at intersections because he paid off cops to turn the signals green when they saw him coming.

This guy made and lost 10s of millions several times until he lost almost all off it in the 1920s. He then made a bet against the market right before the 1929 crash and made $100 million which is the equivalent of $1.5B in todays money, earning him the nickname ""The Great Bear.""

It's important to note his old saying *""There is no bull side or bear side, there is only the right side.""*

Eventually towards the end of his life he once again lost most of his money and went long $ROPE by shooting himself in an NYC hotel.

Regardless of his tragic ending. The guy amassed several lifetimes of wealth from nothing more than a handful of times and the book [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Operator-Investment-Strategies-Livermore/dp/B08L3XC9FV/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=3R2TJ52J7E5FW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=reminiscences+of+a+stock+operator&amp;qid=1614723417&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=remi%2Cstripbooks%2C165&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzT0hISUgyMzdVUDY2JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDc1MjY2WVIxTTVRNzhXTVpSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNTMzNDIxMlNBWlZKRUtUQlU2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) has influenced legends like Paul Tudor Jones, Ed Seykota, Edward Thorpe and George Soros, who all site Jesse Livermore as one of their biggest influences.

So without further ado, here are Jesse Livermore's 10 Crack Commandments for trading in stonks curated by me, a retard.

**1. ‚ÄúThere is nothing new in Wall Street. There can‚Äôt be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.‚Äù**

The market has always moved and continues to move based on human psychology and  behavior. You're kidding yourself if you think otherwise.

‚ÄúThe principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.‚Äù

**2. ‚ÄúBuy stocks in a bull market. Sell stocks in a bear market.‚Äù**

Don't be a üåà üêª in a bull market and don't be a permabull in a bear market.

""Trade the strongest stocks in a bull market and sell the weakest in a bear market.""

**3. ‚ÄúDo not trade every day of every year.‚Äù**

‚ÄúThe desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages.‚Äù

**4. The speculator‚Äôs deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope.**¬†

""All the statue books in the world and all the rule books on all the Exchanges of the earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal.""

**5. ‚ÄúOnly enter a trade after the action of the market confirms your opinion and then enter promptly‚Äù**

The only indicator you need is price action. If the price action shows you that you're right, make the trade. The most profitable trades usually show a profit right away. I get that there are exceptions but it's never smart to rack up losses and tie up capital while you wait for the market to catch up. You can usually form an opinion and then open your position when you notice price movement in your direction.

""Markets are never wrong - opinions often are.""

**6. ‚ÄúContinue with trades that show you a profit, end trades that show a loss‚Äù**

""They say you can never go poor taking profits. No, you don‚Äôt. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market. Where I should have made twenty thousand I made two thousand. That was what my conservatism did for me.""

‚ÄúLosing money is the least of my troubles.¬† A loss never troubles me after I take it.¬† I forget it overnight.¬† But being wrong ‚Äì not taking the loss ‚Äì that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the soul.‚Äù¬†

**7. ‚ÄúNever average losses by, for example, buying more of a stock that has fallen‚Äù**

""Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares at 47 and having the worry double when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred shares.""

**8. ‚ÄúBig movements take time to develop‚Äù**

""It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.""

**9. ‚ÄúIt is much easier to watch a few than many‚Äù**

Don't watch too many stonks.

**10.** **‚ÄúA man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.‚Äù**¬†

Also i've been suffering with this bad boy as it has been oversold and shorted for the past month. Yes $RKT is absolutely mooning right now. Did you miss the RKT Rocket? Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively.  This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do we hate? The shorts! 

Additionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? Load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! 

There are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  

Look at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\~15%)! Do you wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT?

66,lwfb8m,"I keep seeing loads of posts about people who bought into RKT, made quick gains and flipped them back into GME.

I smell BS. 

This is exactly what the hedgies want, to distract and lure people away from GME thinking they can make some quick gains elsewhere before rebounding the GME rocketship. This is all part of their efforts in trying to change market sentiment and get people to move on from GME. 

For everywhere share you sell right now in order to make quick profits elsewhere, thats a share the Hedgies can buy back and cover with on the cheap. DO NOT LET THEM DO THIS.

All we need to do is buy and hold GME, and forget about the rest of the market. 

The more people that flip out and back in, it makes the potential size of the squeeze smaller and smaller. The more we buy and hold, the more explosive the squeeze will be. 

If everyone buys, holds and refuses to sell for under $100k, then a lot of us will see $500k per share and beyond.

71,lwfbke,"Look, I am just here for the tendies like the rest of you. I've been in finance for 10 years. It was my first career, and then I moved on to own several small businesses simultaneously. 

When I saw the GME trade last month, I believe I saw it the same way that many WSB outsiders saw it: a new era in trading. 

I instantly joined your forum and was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence carefully concealed under the constant barrage of circle jerking, banana eating, tendie getting, cursing, and obscure references.... But I could read in between the lines, started paying attention, and thanks to some excellent DD by a few of you, I executed the best trade of my life on RKT today. That said.... There's still space. Here's why:

The dividend announcement should get everyone's attention. At $23-24, it was basically giving away 5% to shareholders. Big institutions will pile in for the free money. That run will probably continue through Friday.  This is the first dividend the company has announced.

RKT financials are actually BLOWING AWAY the industry. Check them out. This is not a company that MIGHT become profitable someday. This is the real deal on earnings. 

Share price has been historically suppressed since inception of the ticker. Check out the trading range for yourself. 

In comparison to trading multiples of competitors, they are trading at prices that are lower than normal. 

Finally, I believe we have huge momentum and attention from today's trading. Take a good look and do what you feel. 

Thanks guys for letting me play along. I wish my great grandfather, an old school New York banker, who grew up a poor black child in Bulgaria, could see this...

Wallstreetbets caught my attention in early January but I finally FOMO's into GME at the end of the month after a friend called me and asked if I know what is happening. I know the old saying: ""Buy the rumour sell the news"" but reading all your diamond hand posts and sarcasm comments really did cheer me up. I was also going through a break up and it is safe to say that GME and Wallstreeetbets saved my mental wellbeing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel slightly disappointed. I am in 30 percent profit from GME... I really expected to see some red and post loss porn like all the other apes. Money is great but that reddit karma is valuable as well. 

GME was my first investment apart from a few gold pieces that I bought last year. I really want to learn about STONKS because I like them. Can you recommend a Youtube course on stonks (or something else) so that I can enter the casino with more knowledge on ways to lose my wife's boyfriend's viagra money?

83,lwfd0i,"Hi all, if this gains attention great if not it‚Äôs worth my time trying. This is a heavily shorted, manipulated stock one of which is Chamaths. Bank of America has a PT @ $20. This was targeted by Hindenburg, all upgrades were reaffirmed after his report on Clover, which was really testing the waters to come out with short reports on other companies.

58% of today‚Äôs short volume was naked. It is the highest amount since they have been public. It has been shorted heavily at all attempts of a breakout.

Furthermore it‚Äôs getting heavily shorted more now at OVERSOLD levels than at any time previously. RSI is at 32 right now! This is insane. Remember originally how RobinHood restricted trading for meme stocks? Yeah, Clover was one of those stocks. Why? Because it‚Äôs heavily shorted! No rational individual can look at this chart and say there was any risk posed for volatility in the stock other than a potential short squeeze that never happened.

SHORT SALE RESTRICTION is in place tomorrow! If this gets trending it‚Äôs an almost guaranteed $15+ stock. I‚Äôve done my part, good luck too all. Thank you for reading.

Was a stock once valued at a grand ol spanking 50 medallions. 50$. It now? 2.40$. And it used to be lower but a source tweeted yesterday saying the company is liquidating 2.1 BILLIONS to not go under. 

LET ME BE CLEAR, this is a gamble to see if tomorrow they don‚Äôt go bankrupt, this if it does not go bankrupt THIS IS is a 4/5$ stock.

TL;DR Rocket Labs is actually going to the moon confirmed. [I shit you not.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/)

If you didn‚Äôt read into the news, company deck and analysis out there, here is the important shit.

**TAM**

* Forecasted to be 1.4T in 2030
* Space is the next frontier, unforeseen TAM expansion

I know your smooth brains can't even predict where you'll wake up tomorrow morning, but this is like trying to forecast how big the internet was going to be in Stanford's basement.  


**Backers**

* Solid names like Lockeed and Blackrock. When you say Blackrock and Rocket in the same sentence, you know it's game over
* Auntie Cathie is probably eye balling this company hard, probably trying to come up with excuses on why it should be added to each ETF
* SpaceX only allowed 69 investors in for the last raise, people are hungry to throw money at it. The line to get in is longer than the unemployment line. Where do you go when you can't get in?

  
**Revenue growth**

* Easily beat 2021 forecast, already 90% booked, this is straight out of their pitch deck. Yes, companies lie, but go look at [this man's face](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/), would he lie to you? 
* Government (not just US) space spending will increasing YoY. Biden wants to leave a mark, and not the kind of shit on the backwall of his toilet bowl.
* Space Startups increasing YoY, and everyone needs a ride to orbit. This is like 2 am when the club closes, everyone wants an Uber but there ain't enough drivers. RL's launches are already booked out.
* Satellites as a service is a new business model, making it accessible for a lot more companies, already picking up traction. Ryan Cohen with his own GME satellites? Hell, this sub can probably pool together for WBS satellite.  


**CEO**

* Does actual rocket engineering like Elon, you don't want some bean counter.
* Guy is a genius, multiple records and awards, [he has actually sat on a rocket and set a land speed record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-29/at-18-he-strapped-a-rocket-engine-to-his-bike-now-he-s-taking-on-spacex)
* Elon has is a busy man, he's looking after 4 different companies. This is Peter's only focus.
* Let's be honest, better accent, and bigger belly. This is good.  


**Moat**

* Vertically integrated entire Rocket and Satellite manufacturing process. They make their own shit.
* Already becoming a supplier for component ingredients. They supply people their shit.
* Patents build up of 3D printed rocket engine designs, battery integration, etc. Had me at 3D printing.
* Private, government back launch sites dedicated to RL. This is the new hot real estate.

  
**Brand**

* Proven track record. They've launched 97 Rockets to date, this is more than 69 for those of you that can't count.
* Multiple government contracts, NASA level shit
* Elon tweets @ em, we all know what Elon's tweets can do
* Their logo is a üöÄ 

  
**Competition**

* Only 2 companies consistently making it to orbit: SpaceX and RL
* SpaceX dead set focused on Mars colony with Starship, (retired F1, likely F9). RL will happily take that piece of the pie. RL is going to the Moon [and Venus](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html). To me, we're are going to another fuckin planet, don't care which one.
* Everyone else either is showing no results, and/or struggling with failures, delays and change in management. Rockets are hard, who knew, even Bezos' Blue Origin is laggin.  


**Short term catalysts**

* Moon mission is going to going to make waves, but I don't need to tell you that.
* ARK will add, just a question of for how many ETFs.
* Look, they can do up to 120 launches a year, the viewership for these launches are trending up, the only different is, there will now be a stock ticker watermarked to screen.
