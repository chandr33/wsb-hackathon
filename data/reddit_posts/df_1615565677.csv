I’m interested in the opinion of more experienced people on Carnival (CCL.L).

I’m just wondering what you guys think would be a reasonable estimate of where this stock will end up in a couple of years. Will it reach its previous highs of around 5000? Or are those days gone for good?

90,m3l5sm,"March 12 (Reuters) - The National Securities Clearing Corp (NSCC) has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aiming to change norms around the deposits that brokers are required to post ahead of the expiry of stock options.

The NSCC, a centralized clearing and settlement provider, in a filing signed last Friday, applied to change the mechanism for calculating supplemental liquidity deposits (SLD), asking for these deposits to be calculated on a daily basis, instead of only in advance of monthly equity options expirations.

Options trading has caught the fancy of retail investors over the last year, accelerating volatility in some single-name stocks. A spike of more than 1,600% in videogame retailer GameStop's stock price prompted concerns about the stability of some brokers who offered options to clients.

In the application, the NSCC also asked to begin an intraday SLD obligation that would apply ahead of options expiration activity periods and possibly on other days, if needed.

The NSCC, established in 1976 and regulated by the SEC, helps brokers offset buy and sell positions, consolidating transactions into fewer payment obligations.
