96,ly21yh,"Edit: It seems that, whether it be fomo or just the shitty day the market had today, most people have strong feelings against NNOX. Read my replies, and my half ass DD, and look into the company yourself. You have to be optimistic and not shut down anything that’s not being pumped and not make yourself believe disruptive technology doesn’t exist. I was attempting to help point out a ridiculous terribly undervalued stock but if disruptive tech isn’t for you then that’s ok. 

Think of NNOX like like Elon Musk when he was an infant, and you are a couple who is unable to have kids so they go adopt a kid, and turns out you adopted the soon to be richest man alive. An infant company soon to become one of the largest disruptive technology businesses of the decade, that just graduated from middle school and is off to high school where he will decide what he wants to do with his life. When he graduates, he asks to be able to comeback home after college, and your job as his parent is to say yes or no. He really wants to and says he will never talk to you again if you say no. As he seems to be worth nothing and no benefit to society, you say no. Turns out he goes off to college and graduates and becomes the richest man alive. The only issue is, he won't talk to you, or even look at you, because he's to busy being a multi billionaire. You are now wishing you took him back in after college. Don't not take in this business once it graduates from college (and begins manufacturing and selling product).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in NNOX since the beginning, and wish I bought at the price it's at now every time it dipped. Although it is the Tesla of x-rays, NNOX has no sales and are waiting on FDA approval which is to be obtained within 30 days (after they had a additional information request). The graph shows the hype when it first went public, then when it was shorted by Citron, and then its live demo, and then retail investors (who own majority of the float) getting bored and selling / panic selling in current market conditions. Not necessarily a DD but something that you ought to look into. Insanely disruptive technology that early investors get rewarded for holding before the hype takes over and goes to the moon (like Tesla) when Citron shorted it. Nano-X Imaging Ltd is the official name and NNOX is the ticker. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR NNOX is elon musk in the form of a business and you are the parent and you can either reject him or take him back in before he becomes a multibillion dollar business.","NNOX shorted, FDA 510k incoming, disruptive technology, stock at insanely undervalued price, was shorted by Citron in the past (so was Tesla)",0.38,1614912067,Interesting-Purpose8
