3,m30hfy,"[Yahoo! Finance article.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html)

""GameStop ([GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/)) has already had quite the week, up almost 80% since Monday following news that board member and investor Ryan Cohen would play a key role in the business’s e-commerce strategy.

Bulls expect the presence of Cohen, who founded pet goods retailer Chewy, to help the company fulfill the potential GameStop fans believe it has as it transforms from a brick-and-mortar focused business to something more modern.

The [GameStop bulls](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-phenomena-is-about-the-poor-vs-rich-reddit-wsb-user-204822769.html) who see the company as an underrated, long-term value play may not be paying that much attention to the moves of the stock, but it’s [hard to miss the roller-coaster ride](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-stock-on-a-roller-coaster-once-again-as-short-interest-drops-193227331.html). As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after [short-sellers learned their lesson](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-squeeze-explained-yahoo-u-203515440.html) in the late January squeeze, losing billions.

But according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.

'We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.'

Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer [here](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/).)

 

To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%.

'This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,' Dusaniwsky said. '\[Wednesday’s\] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.'

All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said.""","S3 Partners: ""We should see the GME short squeeze continuing.""",1.0,1615496022,Rahf

9,m30iv8,"I Have high conviction in fb it’s the only individual stock I own. 
The rest is mutual and index funds. 

I just read a study that 20% of facebooks employees are working on vr and ar.
They have 58 thousand employees. 

I bought the quest 2 and it’s amazing and only 299. Crazy value. 
I play on it every day. Everyone who has tried it loves it and thinks that it’s mind blowing, my brother bought one after he tried it. 

1 million quests 2 sold and 100 million made by the games on the oculus store. I think that the number of quests sold will massively increase in the coming 5 years.

I think that this tech is similar to when the iPhone came out. A lot of people don’t believe in it I just do. Because I have one in my home. You have to try it before you make up your mind. And try the best games to see the potential. Half life alyx on pc
And in death unchained on the quest 2 imo. 
I think that vr is very underestimated. 

Facebooks hardware is great but the software is lacking and that’s why I think that it isn’t mainstream yet. 
Some games are amazing. I mean mind blowing good graphics and super fun but 50-80% are just not good enough yet. 
But since the quest 2 was a hit for vr 
( 1 million sold ) 
I think that a lot more developers are going to make games to the quest because it’s getting a lot more profitable, and a upward spiral will come from it. 

I think that the oculus quest will be big  within the gaming in 3-5 years and that vr will be mainstream in 15 years. 


Videos need a lot of improvements but they have lots of potential. And in a few years it will be amazing. I don’t want to get crass but I think that pornography will be big within vr in 5 years. Movies will also be a plus for getting a quest. 

I researched about 50 different companies in vr and the best play right now is fb imo. 
They definitely have the best product by far. Of course there are other better Vr headsets but they are around 1000 dollar and you need a powerful computer. 
Quest 2 is a stand alone headset, no wires and no computer needed. 
It’s amazing what they have pulled of and they are already working on the quest 3 and 4.

I’ve been looking for game developers within vr but unfortunately the ones that I’m interested in are private for now. 
Value and superbright are the two ones I’m the most interested in. 

Fb is also working on ar, I don’t know much about ar but I think it has potential, but I think that it will take a lot longer. 

So that’s the main reason why I have high conviction in fb, 

A plus is that Facebook balance sheet is looking good. Low p/e for this market.
Lots of cash low debt, 22% revenue growth in 2020.
And a lot of big investors are investing in fb right now. 

Risk with regulation and with apples possible update but I think that’s priced in. 

I don’t see TikTok as a much of a threat, 
People will still need a platform to share pictures and connect. 
TikTok is more of a threat to YouTube.
Facebook will be used by the older generation and Instagram by the younger generation.
And fb will buy up any competition along the way. 

I will probably hold Facebook for about 5-15 years or until people really appreciate what vr has to offer. 
It takes up about 8% of my portfolio.

28,m30k9g,"CHWY is on the move. I think it’s good for 100 by next week but hopefully back up to it’s high of 118 from last month.

It is hard to find news on CHWY because every GME article that mentions CHWY Co founder Ryan Cohen is actually talking about his move to GME’s board of directors. 

My position on this is one 81 call expiring 9 April purchased at 6.35 a few days ago. If I would have known they’d bump the earning report from 1 April to 30 March I would have saved some money and bought a 1 April call because this is the catalyst I’m looking forward to. I wish I had the money to properly invest in the stock but I think the call will be worth 500-2000. 
https://ibb.co/XZC9JqQ



Their last four earnings reports have been above estimates.

They’re still expanding operations and not quite profitable yet, but forecasted to be sooner than expected.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chewy-inc-nyse-chwy-expected-052241598.html

Cramer likes CHWY that’s one thing we agree on
https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-would-you-sell-gamestop-now--15593444

People label it a Covid stock but I think they are mistaken. Chewy was able to deliver the medications when vets could not during the crisis.. Nobody is going to pay their vet’s absurd prescription markups or haul their own 50lb bags of kibble after using chewy. Bottom line Chewy saves pet owners time and money and Covid won’t change that. 

Swiss bank UBS downgraded it in January then BOUGHT THE DIP (166000 shares) in early March those dirty dogs! They didn’t quite get the full dip as it was around 100 at the time. Most analysts price targets are around 95-100.

84,m30sgq,"I stumbled upon $XSPA through a stock screener for stocks that ONLY go to the MOON. Searched it up on REDDIT and saw mixed sentiment so APE did some digging.

**XpresSpa Group** is a health and wellness services company, and provides spa services and related products at airports.

Since the pandemic, it started providing COVID-19 screening and testing, and rapid testing services for other communicable diseases, such as influenza, mononucleosis and group A streptococcus *(the two biggest words in this DD),* and flu vaccination services under the XpresCheck brand. As of January 20, 2021, it provided its services through 45 locations in 23 airports worldwide, and there are 9 COVID testing locations.

**What I like about the stock based on historical financials:**

1. Good Price to cash balance ratio
2. Relatively low debt compared to equity
3. Sales growth was greater than 25% on average for the past 5 years

**Negative sentiments from the BEARS:**

1. Shareholders substantially diluted in the past year when management issued equity raise last year
2. Currently unprofitable and not forecast to be profitable over the next 3 years
3. Stock has done poorly since June of last year
4. Lots of bagholders from the 'supposed' recent pump and dump

**Macro Level FACTS (can be applied to other stonk Thesis as well)** 

1. Economic growth: there will be a transition in spring to a strong summer
2. Pandemic significantly and negatively impacted service sector, however, this is the most flexible sector as it is very easy to open up service businesses so recovery will be fast in summer
3. This is the first ""recession"" where total household disposable incomes went up
4. I would add that most jobs lost were low paying jobs while there was an increase in high paying jobs
5. Significant decline in consumption were among high income individuals who essentially became forced savers
6. As a result, there is a lot of money sitting in checking and savings account that is not being spent
7. Conclusion: all this money will be utilized when there is a full greenlight from government. People will spend that on services, not goods. There is pent up demand and ability to spend that money

# My BIG take:

1. **BIG SERVICES SPENDING:** I think big part of the spending will be travelling safely and treating yourself. $XSPA can take advantage of both with its XpresSpa (wellness services) and XpresCheck (safe travel testing). Now I know the idea of getting tested at the airport seems like too late, but there are many travelers who will require this service for various reasons (not knowing that arrival country requires test, last minute travellers, issues with completed tests, etc.).
2. **FAST GROWTH**: They have signed 7 contracts with airlines and airports in 2021 to open testing facilities. They have been collaborating with United Airlines heavily on these contracts. In Canada, UK and few other countries, they require ALL arrivals to do a mandatory COVID test at the airports--there can be some opportunity for $XSPA here to grow XpresCheck business through these new rules.
3. **SHORT INTEREST PLAY?** I don't know the exact short interest % because i'm retarded, but on my brokerage account, the borrow rate is \~26% which is quite high and indicates there is heavy shorting on this stock
4. **PROFITABILITY**: COVID testing is a relatively high margin business so this will help alleviate their negative profitability in the coming months
5. **BIDEN PLAN:** There is a lot of emphasis on preventative of and care for COVID through testing and vaccination in the $1.9T bill relief bill. I expect some of the funding to have spillover in the Airport testing space

Overall, this stonk has good things going for it a rocketship play. What are your thoughts on it?
