0,m2weph," ‚ÄúWe should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,‚Äù he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. ‚ÄúBut as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME‚Äôs stock price retraces.‚Äù

Short interest may have fallen, but it‚Äôs still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn‚Äôt count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer [here](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/).)

To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%.

‚ÄúThis has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said. ‚Äú\[Wednesday‚Äôs\] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.‚Äù

**MicroVision: $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**

I can‚Äôt tell you what people expect from the 4th Qtr CC, but I wouldn't look for an announcement that the company was sold. I wouldn‚Äôt look for an announcement that someone took an equity stake. I wouldn't look for an announcement that Lidar A-Sample is already done. In my opinion these are not realistic expectations and may not happen at the 4th Qtr Earnings CC.

However, I would look for an update on all of the relevant topics with a positive spin‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the new MicroVision where the minor dilution of (2.5 million shares sold for $50 million) was done before the 4th Qtr Earnings CC, and not afterwards as has been the case over the past 15 years.

I expect MVIS stock to move forward and not backwards. I would NOT expect that everything is status quo. MicroVision of today is an energetic, vibrant and a wealthy company with a market cap of over $2.5 billion‚Ä¶ a historical high.

So if you own the stock now at the current price and we find out that things are improving and progressing well, why would you sell?

I would look for a mention that we have 50 million more going into 4th Qtr Earnings CC, that we didn't have a few weeks ago. I would expect that the Lidar A-Sample is on target for April and some key specs have improved. I would expect that we have multiple companies conducting due diligence toward acquiring the company.

**MicroVision: Why a $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**

Real billion dollar ideas have trillion dollar market size, they are scalable, and leverage the drivers of growth to go viral or global.

In my last [research on MicroVision ](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-holds-the-keys-to-the-future-3000-profit-potential-in-over-10-billion-ma-article-132.aspx#.YEpP3Z1KjIU)(NASDAQ: MVIS), I introduced this 20 year old high-tech company that is at the cusp of acquisition by a major technology company. In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \[from 25 cents to over $15\] on well qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12-months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.

**Here's the short answer...**

Each of the Six LBS core technology verticals can spawn Trillion dollar markets of the future. Considering the diversity of its product line, built around the LBS core technology over the last 20 years, and protected by it's IP and 500 patents, each core vertical can spawn markets worth trillions, and be worth billions in an acquisition or a merger.

**Why sell the company or merge with a deep pocket Tier 1 Technology partner...**

At low volumes, the cost of components that MicroVision sells to its Tier 1 partners is 5 to 10 times higher than what it is sold for in anticipation of large quantities... and loosing money on each component sold is what has shaped the company's past blunders loosing millions of dollars each quarter for the last 15 years.

Finally, to sell the company, or to sell one or all of its 6 core vertical engines that can spawn trillion dollar markets, is the right decision. Under the leadership and stewardship of a deep pocket Tier 1 technology partner from the FAMGA gang can truly realize the potential of MicroVision technology, and bring hundred of products to the market that will be sold in billion units per year.

In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \[from 25 cents to over $14.95\] on qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12- months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.

[**What to expect from sale or merger of MicroVision...**](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-30-stock-when-acquired-for-5-billion-article-127.aspx#.Xz3sPchKjIX)

Over the last 3 decades, the FAMGA tech giants ‚Äî Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple ‚Äî have collectively made [770 acquisitions](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table). Even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, some have continued to write checks, with Apple being the [most active acquirer in 2020 to date](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?sdate=2020-01-01&amp;edate=2020-05-05&amp;invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table) among them.

This FAMGA group of acquirers has deep pockets. Some of their biggest checks have been written for high-profile companies such as career platform [LinkedIn](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/linkedin) (acquired by Microsoft for $26.2B), chat app [WhatsApp](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/whatsapp) (Facebook for $22B), and video-sharing platform[YouTube](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/youtube) (Google for $1.7B).

Luminar Technologies ([LAZR](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR?p=LAZR)) went public and the stock price at $40 dollars more than doubled in two days as a public company, with a market cap of over $14 billion‚Ä¶ and made its co-founder CEO Austin Russell a billionaire ‚îÄ at the age of 25. Luminar specializes in making Lidar sensors for the [automotive sector](http://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/) that will be used in the development of autonomous vehicles.

However, the keys to several future technologies are being held by an older company MicroVision that was always ahead of its time. [MicroVision](http://www.microvision.com/) (MVIS), founded in 1993, is most famous for their Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMs) and Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) technology that is protected by over 500 patents.

MicroVision‚Äôs automotive Lidar will be packaged in a solid-state module that is smaller, cheaper and more versatile than potential competitors like Luminar and Velodyne.

Autonomous vehicles of the future will utilize MicroVision‚Äôs Lidar because it is a superior ‚ÄúBest in Class‚Äù technology compared to Luminar and Velodyne; and due to its small size, 280M range, and point cloud density of 20 million points per second.

As an investor you know change equals opportunity‚Ä¶ the bigger the change, the bigger the opportunity. The next few years are going to be either the most interesting, exciting, and lucrative years for you or you‚Äôre going to be left behind.

**Change can mean big profits for investors getting in on the biggest changes early.**

These two sectors -- artificial intelligence and TaaS -- are all seeing massive changes and we‚Äôre just starting to see their impact in the world.

Historically, when you just start to see these changes is the best time to buy.

And it‚Äôs why in a few years you‚Äôll be kicking yourself for not jumping on them when you had the chance.

Some of the best, most direct, and highest-potential ways to jump on them are with **Microsoft (MSFT), MicroVision (MVIS) and Tesla (TSLA)**

84,m2wrim,"Repost since I haven‚Äôt taken enough mods behind the Wendy‚Äôs yet. Mods please let me shine. GME to the moon. Today is just the calm before the storm. Yada yada yada. Anyways. Today you‚Äôre going to learn the wrong way to post a juicy stonk meme and how it could ruin your day. 

Honestly, this is long af, but it is needed. So stfu there is no TL;DR learn to read retards. Sit back and eat your PB&amp;J sandwich with the crust cut off and enjoy the story. 

I am a longtime lurker and semi-rare commenter on WSB. I had never posted, so I didn't know the process and how truly cancer it is to get past the gates of gaymod. 

Today, after the absolute tank fest attack of GME, I was messaging with my dad letting him know what happened and he said some fire üî•üî•üî•. I knew instantly that it would give me fat stacks of karma and awards. It was a screenshot of our text message thread. Title was ‚ÄúEven Dad‚Äôs are part of the movement. Truest definition of diamond hands. üíéüôåüèæ GME to the mooooon üöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù cuz i know you retards love rocket ships.

So I posted it. And was like yup here comes my karma...bout to be loaded. But the upvote symbol was greyed out so I was like wtf... So I waited refreshing for like 10 min and nothing. Not one upvote or comment. This can't be bruh this is straight FIRE. So then I was like prob a bug and deleted and reposted. Same thing. Weird. So then I deleted and reposted again. Same thing. Aight... I'm starting to get upset. Quick side note, I had taken adderall for the first time ever that morning so I was hyper-focused.

Then I spent like 20 min scrolling through the meme section sorted by new and seeing how people were posting memes and if they were all actual video memes or if there were pictures too. Most were videos but very few were pics. So it's definitely possible. Then I started getting triggered af. Why tf is mine not showing up?!?! 

So I thought maybe these smooth brains are posting as text and embedding the image to get it to sneak past the gates of gaymod. So I looked up and researched how to do that for like 15 min then figured it out and tried. Immediately deleted by auto mod with a note saying post the actual picture. Fucking fuming at this point. How are all these retards getting their memes through?!!?

Keep in mind... this is all on mobile. I have never browsed or been on reddit desktop version in my life. I post again. Still doesn't work. I open incognito on my computer and go to my post and click it. At the top it says ""this post has been removed by mods blah blah blah"". WTF!!! Why does mobile not tell me this?! All this time of me thinking I'm wildly unpopular and that I don't have fire memes and it was being auto removed by automods and I HAD NO IDEA. What a relief. My post is still fire.

I scroll threw the new meme section again and see a post where someone posted two pics where you can scroll over in the same post and caption them n shit... and was like hmm maybe I can do it that way. So I find a low budget GME moon photo of the internet to put in second pic spot.

It fucking works!!!

I instantly get 27 likes. 3 comments. INSTANTLY. I'm talking 40 seconds tops. People are raving. Literally on üöÄ to karma moon. I'm going to need to build a trophy case to put all my awards I'm about to get. I knew this shit was fire bruh it wasn't me!!!
But then...right in the middle of my climb to WSB 15 minutes of fame...IT GETS FUCKING REMOVED AGAIN!!! No more comments are allowed and no more upvotes!!!! I get notifications for a few comments (that were funny af by the way, good job you quick little retards) but when I clicked them they disappeared. And my upvote arrow is greyed out again. I'm like WHAT THE FUCK. Literally at this point I am beside myself. 

I go back to my incognito browser to find that same thing - ""tHiS pOsT hAs bEeN ReMoVed bY mOds blah blah blah"". Omfg.

So I delete...discouraged af. You will find out soon this was a mistake...

I give up for prob like 20 min and do some work but can't stop thinking about what could have been, kinda like if I listened to my boy u/deepfuckingvalue and all inned when we dropped to $40. So then I'm like I haven't tried it on the computer yet.... So I airdrop the screenshot to myself and go to post it from a normal browser - for the first time ever by the way. 
At the top of the page when I click new post in the browser I get this message:

‚ÄúThere is a very high chance that you will be immediately banned for a couple of days by a bot if you don't read the rules on the sidebar before posting a submission. NOTE: If you delete your image-based post because AutoMod caught it you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPOST IT. DO NOT DELETE IT. Contact a mod and ask for an approval.‚Äù

Bruh.

I have never been more livid in my life.
WHY TF DOES IT NOT SHOW ME THIS ON MOBILE!!!! NEVER HAVE I EVER EVEN SNIFFED SUCH A MESSAGE BEFORE. 

So then I repost it of course just to see if it flies. Knowing damn well I deleted about 17 posts already at this point. Same thing. Greyed out. Incognito says removed. Unfuckingbelieveable. So then I hyper focus on the ‚Äúcontact a mod and ask for an approval.‚Äù
If you made it this far, this is where I can hopefully help out a posting noob like me...

For the life of me I cannot find where tf to find the list of the fucking mods of this fucking stupid ass piece of shit subreddit!!!!!!!!!! Bro I'm so hot at this point I can't see straight. At this point I just have to figure this shit out. I have to win. So I start going to all the pinned threads and just clicking the mod who posted and stickied them and send them a dm saying:

""excuse me, can you please approve my post? I'm not sure why it keeps getting deleted. I've been a member for a long time. (link to post)""

So I send that message to about 5 mods. I'm still clicking around feverishly trying to find a ""contact mods"" through the FAQs and everything and everywhere. Can't fucking find it. This whole process from the first post started at about 1:40 CST. At 2:45ish I took my second Adderall cuz I wasnt feeling the first one I took at 9AM. (so I thought... but looking back on it I was hyper focused on this and not the work I needed to be doing and the second pill was a mistake). According to my time stamps, it is now 3:34PM CST and the second Adderall was starting to kick in.

I waited and waited and kept messaging mods because I had to figure this shit out. I had invested too much. At this point it honestly didn't even fucking matter anymore because my most recent post attempt was now 38 minutes old and it would no longer be new and all the retards would miss it because of the next shiny thing coming by. It was personal.

I keep scrolling and clicking around the sub on pc trying to find something for mods. FUCKING FINALLY I found the section where there is a message mods button. For noobs, this is on the right side of the main page but you have to scroll down far af. If you're looking for it you won't find it. I found it by accident when I got distracted and actually scrolled down the sub to drown my sorrows and failures in memes. 
I click the ""message mods"" button and I write the same message and click send...simmer down for a few minutes awaiting response. Like 3 minutes passed and still nothing so I started freaking out. In my defense it felt like 30 minutes. So I saw when I was stalking the mods that people would comment on their removed posts and tag a mod so I was like oh shit lemme try that. I type the same message in a comment on my post and tag some mods asking them to approve.

Mods Response: ""Sorry, this is too low quality for WSB. It's not particularly interesting or novel.""

............

Bruh... when he responded with that shit I punched so much air to compose myself before my response I look like the Rock now. 

In his defense, he had no idea what I had went through to get to that point. I had touched the mountaintop for 45 seconds, and it was stripped away. I hope this story can help the next autist who finally musters up enough courage to post on the infamous WSB, Thanks for keeping WSB clean and tidy mods, there's a lot of retards in here to wrangle up! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
