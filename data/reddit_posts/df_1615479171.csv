16,m2tvh3,"So GTEC Made an offeringEach Unit will be comprised of one common share in the capital of the Company (each a “Common Share”) and one Common Share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $1.04 for a period of 36 months following the closing of the Offering; provided that in the event the daily volume weighted average trading price of the Common Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) for any 10 consecutive trading days following the closing of the Offering is equal to or greater than $2.00, the Company may, upon providing written notice to the holders of the Warrants, accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants to the date that is 30 days following the date of such written notice.

The Company has agreed to grant the Underwriters an over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment Option”) to increase the size of the Offering by up to 15% of the aggregate number of Units sold under the Offering, such option being exercisable in whole or in part at any time up to 30 days after and including the closing date of the Offering, to cover over-allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes. In the event that the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering to GTEC will be $23,000,000.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to repay indebtedness, fund expansion of the Company’s operating capacity, fund international expansion opportunities and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The Units will be offered by way of short form prospectus to be filed in all of the provinces of Canada, except Quebec, pursuant to National Instrument 44-101 – Short Form Prospectus Distributions. The Offering may be also sold in such other jurisdictions as the Company and the Underwriters may agree.

The Offering is expected to close on or about March 30, 2021 and is subject to market and other customary conditions, including but not limited to, approval of the TSXV, and the entering into of an underwriting agreement between the Company and the Underwriters.

22,m2tvzu,"We here at LeiF studios have decided it we need to let you the community know what is going on. The expansion **GME: Final Frontier** has been our most popular edition thus far for the Game of Life. In fact it is the most popular since the first **End Times™** Update in version 0.250.000.000BCE. 

Due to community outrage, we devs have decided that it would be good to inform the community of the recent changes to the game. The balance tweaks were made after careful consideration of our whale players and some general community feedback. We’ve also added some new features and fixed some small glitches. 

Thank you for your continued feedback on the Game of Life. We hope you ~~exploit~~ enjoy this update to the game.

Power to the Players 

\- Devs

**Patch Notes:**

* The upper limit on limit sells in the **Free™ Market Casino** mini game has now been raised to $42,069,420.69

* Limited time skin available to commemorate the player u/jmanpc as the first person to get the achievement: **Crayon Consumer - Green Edition**
* To prevent bot attacks all players must now type a 🚀 or 💎👐 upon login
* Fixed a glitch where **GME** and **AMC** prices were red. We’ve now returned it to the proper shade of green.
* Player **CиBc** has received a temp ban for misinformation (15 Minutes)
* Players **Schit@del429** and **M3Lv1n22557** are super close to a temp ban. We really mean it this time, stop it pretty please. With love, devs

**About**

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer (33% market share) in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

**Currently MX stock is at $23 a share with $6 net cash on balance sheet (that's right, 1/4 of market cap is in cash). MX also owns a 8"" or 200 mm (diameter) wafer manufacturing plant that produces 30k wafers per month, soon to be in the 45-50k wpm range that could be worth more than $250mm.**

This is one of the hottest assets as there is a global shortage of 200mm manufacturing space. [Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P)

* "" The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. ""
* “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”
* Used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.
* “You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available""
* Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory.

**Enter MX with its Fab 3 8"". Comparable transactions are listed** [**here**](https://twitter.com/ShortsHoward/status/1367321538966425600) **and values MX's foundry at &gt;$250mm.**

The business of producing OLED devices and power integrated circuits also generates $60-65mm of EVITDA in 2021 given the sharp growth profile.

For Sale: "" A source from the investment banking industry said many foreign firms – mostly U.S. and Chinese capital - have already expressed their interest and set up meetings with local securities and accounting firms to ready due diligence ""

**At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x would imply an equity value of $1.3 billion, up from its current market cap of \~800mm.

But here's my attempt at summarizing the theory published by [George Calhoun](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/) in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=533da6742255). (Really good read if you have the time)

Any 🦍 with bumpier 🧠 please step in at any time; I'm working with a marble.

# What happened to short interest?

It's gone.  The short sellers did cover most of their positions.  I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.

# So GME is fuk?

**Not at all.**  There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging.  He's calling it a ""gamma swarm"" and it works like this:

# Call sellers are going short, but not for long

When you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised.  That's it.  If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.

But what if it goes up?  Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract.  With American calls this can happen at any time.  With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date.  That's the gamble when you sell call options.

Big players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.**  That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares.  This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract.  Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell 🚀 calls to 🦍 (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left.  So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.

# How long do they wait?

For GME? 1-5 minutes.  That's wild.

&amp;#x200B;

[From the article](https://preview.redd.it/miioih0yafm61.jpg?width=959&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d57e7c4ac647b75536245709d2c34671b892c3)

# How does this impact GME?

At the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10.  That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.

Now, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares.  Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares.  So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.

# So, ultimately, what's happening?

The author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:

""\[T\]he Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets is said to have **9.4 million members.** If even a fraction of them coordinate their efforts, they can overrun the market""

""This leverage has changed the game. It will be “interesting” to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have.""

""\[T\]his new surge suggests that other companies with different shareholding profiles could be vulnerable. Factors such as size or liquidity could be important. We probably don't know yet what the risk factors are.""

""With the “Gamma swarms” the process has suddenly become violent. The “Gamestonk” rout accomplished *in three hours* what it took the engineers of the legendary Volkwagen short squeeze *three long years* to execute.""

78,m2u4aw,"I have multiple family and friends who are project managers for large construction companies. All of them have said that VIEW are in all of the developers pockets.  Real estate developers are investing heavily in them mandating project managers to use VIEW on their projects. 

Simple reasoning as to why VIEW is the future to help promote conserving energy and cutting costs. 
 
1) Eliminates the need for building shades/curtains

2) Building occupants can change their specific window which may be different than their neighbors to their temperature preference (end user comfort ability)

3) The building management can change it so when the sun is at its peak, the building isn’t so hot and cooling systems don’t need to be utilized as much. 

4) Avoid light pollution at night - when building lights inside are on but it’s dark outside. 

5) Architectural aesthetic purposes. 

VIEW says its products reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by blocking more than 90% of solar radiation from entering buildings.

89,m2u68h,"Hey fellow retards. I’ve got something for you. 

OTLK, known to the average person as Outlook Therapeutics, is a pharma company out of New Jersey that has been developing a single drug for &gt;5 years. This drug, labeled ONS-5010 treats a unique condition common in men over 50 that causes blindness yada yada yada.

What stands out is that if proven successful, this would be the first and only drug to effectively treat this condition. Furthermore, the market is worth TENS OF BILLIONS.

Now here’s where shit starts to get crazy. Remember back when I was saying OTLK has been developing this drug for &gt;5 years? Well the final stage of the clinical trial CONCLUDES AT THE BEGINNING OF Q3. AND WHALES HAVE BEGUN TO CIRCLE.

OTLK started at over $30/share at IPO (5 years ago) and has since declined more then 85% to $2/share. Weeks ago it was $0.60/share. 

By doing additional DD on SEC form 4 (whale tracker for retarded retards) I found bulk purchases by insiders which explains the 200% increase. 

They know something big is coming at the beginning of Q3, and now you do too. 

If this drug is approved by the FDA - which imo has a good chance of happening, an increase of 20,000% is not a meme. 

I’m long, I’m retarded, and I’m on Uber eats scrolling through the different flavored tendies. 

This is not financial advice, I’m a fucking monke.
