First of all this has been a great experience with GME and this sub.

Sup bros.

I say bros because that's what you guys are to me. My brothers in the trenches.

I bought 20 shares of GME on Wednesday 27th.

I read the DD. 

I threw money I could afford to lose and then I got played. 

We all got played. Vlad and Citadel fucked us.

We might never get to the end of that story, but we all know that we got greased up and used like some fuck toy. Some more than others. (You're still on RH? wtf are you doing you're actually retarded)

Now its been a minute since that fateful day in January. We have been tested and tried by our friends, our family, the media but we held strong. We sat through WEEKS of 40$ lows. Waiting. Patiently. A flicker of hope still shone in the dark. You think we're selling now you greedy fucks?

Some of us drank piss. 

Some of us got divorced.

But we all held.

We held each other like Jack held Rose while the mother fucking titanic sank to the bottom of the god damn ocean. Today was just the tip of that glorious penis shaped iceberg that took the whole ship down.

And we're not fucking letting go.

I'm not only here for my tendies. 

I'm here for my brothers tendies.

I'm here for my wife's boyfriends tendies.

I'm here for every Rolex watch on every Citadel execs. wrist. 

I'm here to suck Wall Street fucking dry and rub their nose in the god damn shit stained swamp that they call the financial system. 

And as the system burns to the fucking ground, I'll be blasting god damn sea shanties in my Lambo.

At this point telling you guys to hold is literally useless. You guys know what the fuck to do because you've been doing it so long your hands have turned to diamonds.

See you on the moon.",Moon gang,1.0,1615254734,ThatsOneSpicyTaco

Why agents are moving to Fathom over major brokerages: 

They pay significantly less commission with Fathom than the other Major Brokers 

The Fathom proprietary technology, IntelliAgent, saves agents time and money and makes it easier to get paid faster. 

Free CRM Program for Agents 

Stock Incentive 

In Depth Detail: 

Simple enough, Fathom has one of the best opportunities for agents in the market when it comes to KEEPING their own commission. At a brokerage like Keller Williams, you are expected to pay 20% to 30% of your commission on each sale to the brokerage. On a $300,000 sale at 3% commission, that comes out to $1,800 (@ 20%) or $2,700 (@ 30%) of your $9,000 commission. These brokerages also have desk/monthly/errors and omission (e&amp;o) fees that are $25+ a month. At a certain amount of total commission paid, some brokerages ‚Äúcap‚Äù the agent and they then get to keep 100% of commission. I have seen this be anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 (this will vary by market). 

With Fathom, an agent only pays a one-time yearly fee of $500 (it comes out of the first commission check), and then $450 per transaction up to 12 sales. Then they pay $99 a transaction afterwards. A Fathom agent pays a total of $5,900 before they cap, then $99 afterwards for every transaction. This is simply a PHENOMINAL deal for the agent. 
I reviewed a number of other agencies like Fathom where you keep 100% of your commission and pay a transaction fee. I did not find one that beat Fathom. The closest second was Realty One. I really liked their offering as well but their costs with monthly fees and transaction fees were double what Fathom was. 
The only way I could figure out how to keep more of my commission was to open my own brokerage, which has significantly more liability. 

Fathom OWNS a program called IntelliAgent which every agent they have today uses to submit their paperwork and to obtain funding on their transactions. An agent uploads certain documents to the program in order for their district manager to review for compliance. While this sounds simple, it has been a nightmare in the industry finding something that works across different states with different requirements per transaction. Fathom has navigated this hurdle and IntelliAgent makes it easy for the Agent to get paid. I can speak personally that before I worked for Fathom I had to hire a Transaction Coordinator for each sale I made ($300+ per transaction) just to move the paperwork through my old brokerage. With Fathom I have never needed any assistance because IntelliAgent works so well. This will be a KEY factor in how they scale up from the 27 states they are in today. 

Right now Fathom gives all their agents KV Core, which is a CRM /Marketing platform for agents to use to help run their business and customer drips. It is the same program a number of real estate companies use (I believe EXP uses KV Core). It is a VERY good program. But they do not OWN the program and I am sure they pay a hefty sum to offer this as part of their package. 

On 3/2/2021 Fathom closed a deal to purchase a company called Naberly Solutions. With Naberly, Fathom will have the last piece of the puzzle they did not own; their own proprietary CRM software. By owning the software, Fathom will reduce their costs as they no longer will be paying for KV Core for agents and differentiate themselves from other brokerages. Owning their CRM should also be a major plus for investors. This will be a savings for Fathom once it is rolled out to their agents. I have not seen a timeline announced for that at this time. 

One final reason agents are moving to Fathom is because of the stock program. Right now, seasoned agents are being given stock grants for joining Fathom. Agents who qualify are being offered $200 per transaction they had the year prior to joining Fathom, up to $6000 in grants. These grants come with a three-year vesting schedule which will help keep agents with the company. A lot of the original agents received their stock grants at $10.00 per share when the company had their IPO last year. The stock is currently selling over $30.00 and was over $50.00 before the market downturn the past few weeks. Fathom also launched a program to incentivize current agents to recruit new agents. Agents also get stock grants for each transaction they complete. 

A lot of brokerages have an additional hook to get agents to recruit, but if you look more into them it is more of a pyramid scheme than an incentive program. No one has a program like Fathom is offering with their stock grants. I also believe the upside on the stock is significant and many agents moving over see the potential as well. 
So if everything is cheap and the agent is getting such a great deal, how does Fathom make money? They do so by scaling the business. For the past six years they have been on the INC 500/5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America and are currently in 27 states. Because of the influx of new agents in 2020, they had 74% revenue growth between Q3 2019 vs Q3 2020. 
Fathom also bought a title company in 2020 which should create additional opportunity on each transaction completed by their agents to make additional revenue by being the company who manages the title search (around $75 to $200 per transaction). This does not mean they WILL get that additional revenue on each transaction, but the opportunity will be there when it wasn‚Äôt before. 
I do not expect the acquisitions to end there. They just acquired 230 additional agents in Atlanta through the acquisition of Red Barn Real Estate on 3/5/2021 to add on to the 200 agents Fathom already had in the area per their press release. 
Overall I moved my business to Fathom for the reasons I listed above. I believe in the company and I like the stock.

75,m0w2af,"This is bigger than the Hedgefunds and GME. The system is rigged. The system encourages cheating and stealing. You'll get taught at a young age to do what's right, be honest and make a fair living. You go out into the world and you realize how cutthroat it really is. 

I'm 31 years old and I'm an EMT. I've worked during the whole pandemic and people on unemployment are taking home more money than me with the new COVID relief bill. I live with my girlfriend's parents. She's a vet tech who has also worked during the whole pandemic and made less money than everyone on unemployment too. We both graduated high school in 2007, right before the stock market crash. We both have Bachelor's degree and tried to get into grad school. I spent thousands trying to get into PA school for 2 years, only to be denied because I was competing with people in their 30's and 40's because of the economic depression we were in. 

I was never taught in schools or by my parents on how to invest or properly manage my money. We've been duped into thinking we need to buy things, constantly being thrown at us and it only leaves us feeling empty. I wish I had known about investing when I was young. I wish I hadn't bought so many materialistic things that always left me wanting more. 

I tried starting a business and couldn't get it to be profitable. I tried becoming a personal trainer and it wasn't a consistent paycheck. I worked at UPS delivering packages during the pandemic and made amazing money, but it broke my body down. What's the point of having money and retirement if you can't walk at the end of your career? I've been a certified EMT for the last 7 years and I just started working again full time at it last October.

I feel lost and broken. I've dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life. Stressing about finances doesn't help, either. I failed at getting into grad school. I failed at my business. I've dealt with so many failures my whole life, but I'm still managing.

I am by no means lazy. I've worked 80-100 hours a week in the past and consistently work 50-70 hours a week currently. I went to community College and state school and only ended up with $3500 in student loans which I paid off immediately after graduating. I currently hold no debts other than a car lease. I only started seriously investing last month and I wish I had started much earlier. My girlfriend currently has at least $20,000 in debt from her student loans and she's ashamed that we can't find a place together. She's currently a slave to the system. She's smart and has so much potential to do great things, but she's depressed because she feels trapped and can't get out. 

The school system failed us by not teaching us what the real world is like. The colleges failed us by increasing tuition prices because of guaranteed money from federal loans. The banks failed us because of the housing market collapse. The government failed us with corporate bailouts and lobbying. The government failed us by forcing us to rely on them. The government failed us by shrinking the middle class and only favoring those at the very top and bottom. The government failed us by heavily taxing it's citizens and creating too much control. 

I only have 3 shares worth of GME and I know it ain't much, but it's all I was willing to risk. I hope that whoever reads this understands that this sub has people that are tired of struggling. Life should be enjoyable. Life should be an adventure. All I want is a place for my own. I want to feel independent. I want to feel in control and I feel I'm being pulled in every direction. 

This is more than just about acquiring money. This is about changing our views on money and in life in general. These hedge funds, billionaires and politicians really don't understand. We're the backbone of the country and yet we own little to nothing. WE need to create this change. 

Alone we are so weak, but together we can create something so strong: stronger than they could ever think is possible. We are literally in a revolution and the power is in our hands... not theirs.

99,m0w6n4,"On Friday I decided to sell the majority of my PLTR shares and buy LEAPs. This is my final play to either make it or break it off this golden twat I can't walk away from. I've already lost \~2.4k in PLTR calls from the Thanksgiving Massacre. Ya ya ya I know I'm a retard for still being on RH but I've got margin I need to pay off before moving everything over to TDA. Wish me luck retards.

I timed this horribly...
