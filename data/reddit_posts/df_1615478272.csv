Ok guys, My first post here. Idk how WSB works but I'm open for discussion and want to hear your opinion. 

  
Simply this stock has been despressingly undervalued and oversold this month, the 80% institutional holder wants to hold down the price to buy more.

Beside that there's nothing else that should hold this share price down like this, including the potential lawsuit which every company faces occasionally..

Cons:

1. 80% institutional owner that can move the market and shake the weakhand away
2. Medium market cap and 200% gain over this year is considered bubble by some
3. Short intrest were pretty hight over past month.\~38% when it was around $50

Pros:

1. Potential consumer market gap , and it's competitor like DKNG are still cable depended.
2. The channel it providers its 200+ just for sports.
3. Sport betting contract will be secured with many more states, and price valuation is not even factored in for FUBObet yet.
4. This is a start up company like ROKU and Netflix, and their debt and earning ratio is just getting better every earning report
5. They have only 20% ad revenue so far and 8hour avg watch from it's subscriber.
6. They will also included E-gaming Bet and channel alongside Sports betting, this is huge as almost every millennial plays game unlike the actual sports, so the viewer /subscriber itself it going to be hug gap that can be filled.

Morgan Stanly bought 1.6 % of Fubo's share yesturday,

Overall, in my biased oponion.. This may be really votail in the coming few weeks but entry like right now is cheap steal, PT for this is $40 according to analysis excluding #3,6. so real PT should be at least $100 end of the year.even considering the competitor like DKNG should be no threat to FUBO tbh",Undervalued FUBOtv could have squeez up soon. from $28 to PT $100 EOY as of today.,1.0,1615478344,099x

19,m2ti8z,"Like a good chunk of you, I hopped on the GME bandwagon back around the first peak in January, shoved 500 bucks into a Robinhood account, and got ready to get on the rocket.

And like many of you, I was immediately shut out by the buying ban Robinhood implemented right before the stock started plummetting.  So I looked for another broker, and remembered that I already had some accounts with Charles Schwab. So I loaded up there too, bought some GME and some AMC, and have been diamond handing and averaging down ever since.  Currently holding 8 GME at around 150 avg and 40 AMC at around 8.

This post is not about those shares.

This post is about the $500 still in Robinhood.

I decided to use that account and the stranded $500 as a playground to try out some riskier things, options trading, etc, to see how I'd fare.  It sat there dormant all the way up until last week when I decided to try and get aboard on RKT.  And ever since... Well, here's the graph...

[Ouch.](https://imgur.com/a/kWYHMrI)

Some bad plays on RKT and UWMC shares account for some of that, but my lord the options... Every single play I've made happened to be right at its peak, whether it was a 3/19 put option for 20 on RKT to try and hedge my losses literally the day before a corporate action, or a FOMO TSLA 3/12 call at 820 immediately, IMMEDIATELY losing 50% – and eventually closer to 80%– of its value, I am absolutely terrible at this.  I wish I kept those graphs to show how perfectly I captured the peaks...

25,m2tjaa,"They literally have the cure for obesity as effective as bariatric surgery. Semaglutide works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high by mimicking the body’s own modular, GLP-1: 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/health/obesity-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide.html

From New England Journal of Medicine:
“In the semaglutide group, approximately 70% of participants achieved a weight loss of at least 10%, and approximately 50% achieved a weight loss of at least 15%. Furthermore, one third of participants treated with semaglutide lost at least 20% of baseline weight, a reduction approaching that reported 1 to 3 years after bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (approximately 20 to 30% weight loss).”

Patent protected in US until at least 2031. 

Also known to be safe as same medication is second best selling GLP-1 agonist for Type 2 Diabetes with few side effects reported. 

Even better: Novo (world’s largest maker of insulin and now newer GLP-1 agonists) already markets the first ORAL GLP-1 drug, simply the same sumagluptide branded as Rybelsus. 

Priority review voucher applied to New Drug Application (NDA) with FDA, leading to an anticipated review time of six months. So hopefully approved in next few months. 

People have not been receiving preventive care due to pandemic. And globally (Novo has patent protection in China too but shorter) only 2% of estimated 650 million people receive any treatment because right now either surgery or no good options (will change shortly). 

With millions returning to their doctors now even fatter after Quarantine 15, really think stock is a no brainer. Priced super cheap too with P/E of 24 but poised to become a growth stock. If valued as one worth at least $200 IMO.

87,m2ts4q,"Hello WSB, how are things? Yes, yes, I know GME looks a little red today, but(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE) it will maybe likely probably go up. Who knows? Not me!

Anyway, yesterday someone asked in the Megathread to explain exactly how anyone could think a price point of $1000+ was possible, and to explain it to them like they are in second grade.

So I did.

As I did so, I thought...""Man, there are a lot of retards in this subreddit. Maybe I should post some other aspects of this whole GME thing like they are in second grade(Which may be hard to understand for some of you, and that's fine. Ask your wife's boyfriend for help as needed!), and spread some of this education around.

So, I present to you...

GME. like you're in Second Grade:

Rocks = Stocks (It rhymes, get it? Nice and easy to follow.)

**1. How is a price of $1000+ even possible?**

Imagine your friend has 100 rocks.

I 'borrow' them, and sell them to other people for $5 each. I pay your friend $1 a day to borrow these stocks.

I do this because I think in the future, I can buy 100 rocks for $2 each($200 total), and thus make a $300 profit. So long as it doesn't take me more than 200 days to do this, I turn a profit.

Well, some retarded apes find out that all the rocks are borrowed, so they buy up all the rocks. They refuse to sell those rocks for reasonable prices.

Your friend now tells me ""I need my fucking rocks, or my next visit is to your family, and I won't be asking nicely.""

What do I do? Do I let your friend kneecap my wife over some fucking rocks?

Of course not. I take the loss, and buy the 100 rocks I owe for whatever price they are being sold for.

One guy sells me 10 rocks for $10 each.

His friend has 5 rocks, and won't sell for less than $15 each.

The next guy wants $20 for his 2.

As there are fewer rocks, they sell for more, because people know I'm desperate.

The last guy, says 'Fuck you, man. I won't sell for less than $69,420.'

I get a text message with a picture of my front door.

I buy the fucking rock.

When the time comes, the Short Sellers will have to cover. The only thing that could stop that is if GME files for bankruptcy, or is unlisted from the NYSE.(Correct me if I'm wrong here. Retarded APE too.)


**2. How are the Hedge Funds able to keep dropping the price of GME so much?? I thought stocks only went up?!**

No worries Billy, I got you.

So, imagine the same situation above, alright?

When your friend comes knocking on my door for his rocks, he finds that I moved, and didn't leave a forwarding address.

While he's busy searching for my wife to break her kneecaps, I've grabbed a buddy, and hit the rock market. I see all these people selling rocks for $250, $275, one guy asking for $69,420 like an asshole.

I buy a couple of rocks at the asking price. It's a small price to pay overall.

I then start yelling ""Selling rocks, $249! Come and get them!""

My friend was closest to me, and before all the others can run over, he buys them from me for $249. Everyone is yelling ""BUY THE DIP! ROCKS ON SALE! OMG ROCKET DIAMOND ROCKET"" and my friend looks at his rocks and is like ""Eh, just some rocks. Fuck it. Anyone buying at $248?!""

Someone runs up, who looks NOTHING like me, because he has a hat and large mustache, and I 100% definitely do not, and immediately buy them all for $248.

This is repeated a few times, till my friend is buying them from me for $230 each.

Well, that guy that was selling for $275? He bought them from some other asshole for $315. He sees how many are selling for so low, and now he's worried.

""Damn, I can't afford tendies if I lose ALL of my money. Maybe only a $75 loss is okay?""

So he runs over to the rock market, and yells ""Selling for $225!""

Now we've got an issue. He scared, and so are other people. Everyone freezes for a moment, suddenly worried. ""How much can we lose?!""

Sell sell sell sell! Lower and lower, as each person in line worries that they are going to lose too much, or they want to sell now, and buy back in at a lower price.

Suddenly me and my friend are tossing rocks back and forth at $165 each, and the literal children around us are crying. Finally, I have them all back in my hands.

""Anyone wanna buy for $300?""

**3. The fucks a short squeeze anyway?**

Alright, so, imagine the above. I've borrow bunch of rocks, but the price has gone way above what I thought it would. I've run out of excess funds, I've run out of time. Mommy SEC is calling me home, and I don't wanna be late! I need to buy 100 rocks, right now.

So, I pull out my thick boy wallet, and yell ""Buying rocks, whatever price!"" and kids start pouring out of the woodwork. As they do, they grab fistfuls of cash out of my wallet, and drop rocks at my feet. Bigger, and bigger handfuls, till one asshole literally punches me in the balls, hangs me upside down, and shakes me till $100k drops out of my pockets. I'm not gonna say he spit on me as he walked away, but he probably did.

This is a short squeeze. I'm not allowed to play outside anymore and need to get home before mommy spanks me. I needed to get my rocks now, so paid any price for them.

(Mini question!) But what if you ran out of money, before you got all your rocks?

In a nice world, where everything works out? Big Daddy Fed comes to the rescue. He says, ""Sport, you shouldn't have wasted billions of dollars on rocks. I always knew you were regarded. But, you're my good little boy, so I'll help."" He then prints out billions of Big Daddy Fed dollars to cover the rest of my rock purchases.


**4. So what actually are the short sellers playing at then?**

So, same situation as above.

While your friend is trying to track me down, I'm pushing the value of rocks down as far as I can. I'm doing this, because if I have to buy all 100 rocks at $69,420, I'm going to lose a lot of money. But if I can drive the price really far down, I can lower how much I can lose overall, which is as close to winning as I'm likely to get.

In a short squeeze situation, my loses could be infinite. Of course, I don't want that, the fed doesn't want that. So, they are giving me as much time as possible. Because Mommy SEC loves me, and Daddy Fed doesn't want to pay for my rock shortage, they are willing to wait instead of spanking me as they should.

Probably because I caught Daddy Fed with the neighbor, and Mommy Sec has been taking money from other children, but who actually knows.

Recently,  I've been thinking a lot about Tesla and Apple and couldn't help but  notice just how similar the trends in their practices are. Let's take a  closer look at what exactly they do similarly.

**Broadly  speaking, while many other companies base decisions off of current  consumer wants, Tesla &amp; Apple dictate their decisions based on their  own vision of simplicity**. This generally means that the  decisions they make are more geared towards their vision without too  much regard for the consumer. On Apple's side:

1. They  took away the headphone jack from their iPhones in 2016. Sure, there  were valid reasons (saving space on the inside), but this pissed a lot  of people off. In the end, we saw that this decision was a way to  promote their Airpods and further their version of a minimalist future.  And guess what? Not long after, all other companies took away the  headphone jack too.
2. They  removed the charger from the box of the iPhones in 2020. Once again, an  anti-consumer decision. Whether or not this decision ""saves the  environment"" or not isn't something I want to debate, but we just know  this further contributes to their minimalist vision. Again, Samsung and  Xiaomi followed and took away the charger from their box as well.
3. They  took away the standard USB ports from their 2016 and later Macbooks,  opting for USB C. Who the hell used USB C in 2016? Nonetheless, this  decision made the computer more minimalistic and simple; in fact, five  years after that transition, USB C seems to be the way to go for most  laptops nowadays.

Like  Apple, Tesla has made a number of decisions that are controversial, and  their new 2021 Model S lineup seems to further support this idea:

1. The  2016/17 Tesla refreshes dramatically simplified their vehicles in the  name of simplicity. For one, the Model 3 had automatic windshields,  headlights, and even braking (you very rarely have to press on the  brakes ever since regenerative braking automatically stopped the car  fully). These were not that controversial, but the windshield one seemed  odd. To control the windshields manually, one had to enter the Tesla  menu and change it there rather than having a windshield stock like all  cars did at the time.
2. The  2021 Tesla Model S refresh made a number of ""anti-consumer"" decisions  much like those of Apple. For one, the yoke steering wheel seems to  serve NO practical purpose other than put drivers at risk. It is rumored  that there will be no D/N/R gear stock, meaning the car AUTOMATICALLY  decides which gear you should be driving in based on your surroundings  (ex: if you're in a parking spot and there's something in front of you,  it will automatically put the car in reverse). Like, who asked for this? This is the MOST Apple-esque thing that Tesla has ever planned to do. 

Another  aspect of simplicity is the release timeline and refresh of models. To  accurately illustrate this point I'll compare them with other companies.  Let's start with Apple:

\- Releases only a few new phone models per year. In the past, there was just **one iPhone per year**.  This year there was the iPhone 12 mini, 12, 12 pro, and 12 pro max. It  sounds like a lot, but compared to Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi (the  three biggest Android phone makers) it's nothing. Of course, they have  their main S20/S20+/S20 Ultra/Note 20/Note 20 Ultra, but Samsung also  has their S20 FE, M41, A51, A71, A71 5G, A51 5G, and the list just goes  on and on. Yes, there are even considerable differences in the 5G  versions of each phone, such as having different chipsets and thus  different performance. You can look at the smartphones for Huawei and Xiaomi and the lists are equally long.

\-  When Apple makes decisions, they stick with them for a long time. The  home button iPhone models with the &lt;4 inch screens (2007 iPhone —&gt;  2013 iPhone 5) had very similar designs. What's more, the 2014 iPhone 6  —&gt; 2017 iPhone 8 had **indistinguishable**  designs. They had identical screen sizes, resolutions, and the  exteriors looked exactly the same. The same applies for the notch at the  top of the screen. Since the 2017 iPhone X the notch design has barely  changed even after four release cycles (X, XS, 11, 12). For comparison,  take a look at Samsung's main S lineup: S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21. **Every single year the phone looks considerably different**. This is not a good or bad thing, but just an observation.

Ok  this post is getting super long but bear with me here. Tesla is no  different from Apple in these release cycles and to show that I'll  compare it to some companies.

\- **Tesla only has five models** (one unreleased): **S, 3, X, Y, Roadster** (tehcnically). The models are **only refreshed every four years or so**.  In 2016, the Model S was refreshed for the first time since 2012,  getting a slightly sleeker design and some interior changes. Again, this  Model S held until 2021, where the model is undergoing changes for the  first time in five years. Let's look at how many models **Toyota**,  one of the biggest car brands in the world has: Corolla, Yaris, Prius,  Avalon, Camry, RAV4, RAV4 EV, C-HR, Land Cruiser, Supra, 86, Mirai,  Tacoma, and the list goes on forever.  Each of these models goes through a refresh cycle quicker than every  four years like Tesla, and a lot of stuff is changed (not just a minor  front cosmetic refresh like the Tesla Model S).

What does this all mean for the consumer? It means two things, good and bad:

1. **They have less choices to make.**  The consumer's buying decision is much easier. If they want an iPhone,  they only have so many choices. If they want a Tesla Sedan, there aren't  20 different choices like one would face buying a Toyota.
2. **On the flip side, the consumer is subject to the choices, good and bad, of the company**.  Whenever Apple or Tesla make a bad decision, the consumer has to go  along with that decision if they want to stay with the company. When  Apple switched their **entire laptop lineup** to USB C, or when they removed the headphone jack from **all of their phones**,  consumers had to deal with that if they wanted an iPhone. If that  individual instead had a Samsung phone, they have a ton of other phones  to choose from, many of which retain the headphone jack (of course, a  buying decision is more complicated than whether or not there's a  headphone jack. this is just an example).

Lastly, ***what does this mean for Tesla's future?***

Here is one potential way this all could play out based on Apple's position in the market:

1. In  the next five years, Tesla will be all the talk the same way the iPhone  was everything in the first few years of its launch. No other company  had done what Apple had done with the phone then, so they played catchup  in this period.
2. By **2025–2030**,  a number of companies will have exceeded Tesla's EV in different ways.  Some might have much better performance (faster 0–60s, higher HP, etc.)  for better prices, or longer range. The analogy of this is in 2014 and  2015 when Android phones began to cost less than iPhone with better  specs.
3. In  10+ years when the EV market matures, Tesla will still be a market  leader but likely in the same way that Apple is a ""market leader"". While  not being majority percentage of the automobile market Tesla will still  be one of the biggest players (the same way Apple currently holds 9%  market share in computers with macOS and 27% of the global phone  market).

Once again, I'm  a retard. There will be things you disagree with and maybe things that  are out-right incorrect, but I hope you took away something based on the  general premise of the post.

tl;dr: Main reasons for why Apple and Tesla are similar:

1. Apple  and Tesla make decisions to advance their ultimate vision of  simplicity, not thinking about the consumer first (Apple removing iPhone  headphone jack in 2016, removing iPhone charger in 2020, Tesla's yoke  steering wheel 2021 + automatic gear shifting)
2. Similar  to 1, but their lineup advances this vision of simplicity to make the  consumer's decision easier (Only a few new iPhones each year compared to  other phone companies, Tesla only has four current car models)

Prediction  of Tesla's future: While for the first few years they will be the  dominating EV maker, companies will start to catch up in 2025–2030 and  have ""headline features"" (ex: longer range, better performance, more  software quirks). After 10 ish years of EV market maturing, competition  will continue to be fierce and push the boundaries of innovation but  Tesla will still have a considerable stake in the market (between 10%  and 30%).",Tesla vs. Apple Company Trends DD,1.0,1615479096,root3over2
