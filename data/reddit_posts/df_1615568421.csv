28,m3m2vl,"I don't understand why people are choosing to compare Roblox mkt cap to game development companies. Roblox is not a game nor a game developer. 

Roblox is a platform with both development tools and a social media aspect linked to it... This is not DD and is only opinion but comparing Roblox to Activision is like Comparing Tesla to Ford. The comparison makes no sense and maybe people are trying to spread this FUD to lower their own point of entry to the stock but there is a reason why ARK bought 500k shares. 

Roblox should be compared to Facebook and other social platforms first and foremost. Then take a look at user growth in a website like Codecademy ... These are more accurate comparisons. 

People and news outlets comparing Roblox to a game developer that spits out one major title every 5-10 years and hopes they can retain their online multiplayer user base are not the same thing and do not look like they ever will be. 

This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

I can assure you however, that at this price I am confident RBLX is a great long term hold and if the price were to drop my only reaction would be to grab more shares.

**PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS**

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION**

**DATED FEBRUARY 25, 2021**

**LITHIUM CORPORATION**

**22,979,458** **Shares of Common Stock**

This prospectus relates to the offer and sale of up to 22,979,458 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, of Lithium Corporation, a Nevada corporation, by Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (‚Äú*Lincoln Park*‚Äù) or the selling stockholder.

The shares of common stock being offered by the selling stockholder have been or may be issued pursuant to a purchase agreement that we entered into with Lincoln Park on January 25, 2021. See *The Lincoln Park Transaction* for a description of that agreement and ‚Äú*Selling Stockholder*‚Äù for additional information regarding Lincoln Park. The prices at which Lincoln Park may sell the shares will be determined by the prevailing market price for the shares or in negotiated transactions.

We are not selling any securities under this prospectus and will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.

The selling stockholder may sell the shares of common stock described in this prospectus in a number of different ways and at varying prices. See ‚Äú*Plan of Distribution*‚Äù for more information about how the selling stockholder may sell the shares of common stock being registered pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholder is an ‚Äúunderwriter‚Äù within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‚Äú*Securities Act*‚Äù) .

The selling stockholder will pay all brokerage fees and commissions and similar expenses. We will pay the expenses (except brokerage fees and commissions and similar expenses) incurred in registering the shares, including legal and accounting fees. See ‚Äú*Plan of Distribution*‚Äù.

Our common stock is currently listed on the OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol ‚ÄúLTUM‚Äù. The trading price of our common shares has recently increased significantly, which we believe is attributable to growing global demand for (and production of) lithium ion battery powered electric vehicles, and a corresponding increase in investor speculation in exploration companies with prospective lithium assets.

I come here today to tell you we are all retards. But what makes us beautiful here is that we are all retards in different ways, and we can make up for our shortcomings together.

That being, I have just overcome a shortcoming and I wish to share it with other banana-loving retards who may have also made the incorrect assumptions I have (I think it‚Äôs best to learn now that assuming anything about how the stock market works is the ultimate retard move).

As I have learned about stocks, I heard that brokers were allowed to lend out shares that they hold for their customers as long as it is allowed by the account. My incorrect assumption was that this was only true for shares held in options specifically on a margin account (must‚Äôve eaten a few extra crayons that night). So for that reason, I did nothing to keep my broker from lending my shares seeing as I have a cash account. But I was wrong. They can lend any of your shares if you do not turn off permission for you account.

So all you apes, retards, and autists who only started trading a month or two ago, go to your account and make sure that you have removed permission for your broker to lend your shares out to hedge funds for shorting. They don‚Äôt need any more ammo to keep the price down.

98,m3me3l,"Objective facts: 

A:

Since I've been watching the options tape (the 1st of March) deep ITM call volume has been coming through daily, especially on days we've rallied. With no relative change in Open interest. 

Here you see Apr 16th, 12C Volume. basically only u/DeepFuckingValue  position has been open since early Feb. Yet we see volume exceeding Oi repeatedly. This is the same for many deep ITM strikes, expiry ranging from Mar19-June/July Monthlies. Fact check this all yourselves don't take my word for it. 

https://preview.redd.it/t1hjuvrrmmm61.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fc8ccf68fdbb4eb1b6e197c58f69385f487db2a

B: Far OTM puts have been bought in mass over the past few weeks expiry ranging from this week, Mar 12 all the way out to Jan 2022. Some months having more Oi than others but generally speaking people are buying millions of these contracts with no expectation of actually hitting their strikes. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjuwp2aaomm61.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fd4dd28604b19de229c2d594f1af78f18e4350

Again, fact check this all for yourselves, the data is there to analyze. Don't take my word for it. 

Millions of far OTM puts bought for expiry as near at today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiyj5dqmomm61.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d4d743c988e02b430443e6dffc07132cb21fa5

\*MY INTERPRETATION\*NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\*:

The ITM calls are a handshake deal between market entities, the volume isn't reflected in Oi because it's neutralizing shares that are already shorted into the market. In effect, there is no position, because the short shares are available to buy from whoever paid hundreds of millions in premium to neutralize their position as price rises. The shorts are effectively closing their position and waiting for price discovery to sell the options back to the writer and again open the short. All without affecting the share price.

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets say those OTM puts need to be hedged to some degree right? Of course they do, whoever is short those put contracts has to ensure that they are neutral if price falls and those contracts become ITM (extremely unlikely for the nearer term contracts but they still need some sort of hedge by shorting shares)

Now here's where I'm 100% speculating as to what happened Wednesday, but I'm rather confident in my analysis. It's what I would've done to protect myself to drive the price down, if I were to seek to manipulate retail emotion. 

&amp;#x200B;

***They don't hedge the short put positions right away***

The smart move if you were simply hedging and becoming delta neutral would be to trickle in short shares as to not effect the price of the market as soon as you were forced to take the short put positions. BUT if you wanted to drop the market really fast to scare investors you accrue short puts for weeks and dump in your hedge all at once. That way, you're hedged properly if you need to make good on the put contracts. (remember they're so far OTM that it's unlikely they'll actually have to and they're just getting free premium either way)

The best part of this whole deal for whoever paid the put and call premiums. They have no skin in the game, they only suffer debits made to options writers. The hedged shares aren't an actual short, they're simply a vehicle for becoming neutral in the name. Unsure if they even need to declare it since you have the offsetting position of short puts. Again, the same as the ITM calls, it's effectively not a position at all!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: They can infinitely manipulate to the downside as long as they keep paying the options writers, and the options writers are happy to do so and are on the same page as the people with actual shorts because they're ALSO short a bunch of OTM calls. The difference between the two naked shorts in OTM contracts is they dip-feed the bought hedges, and inject the short hedges. 

&amp;#x200B;

Boom, that's how we get 800K shares straight into the bid on days like Wednesday and back in late January and Early Feb. 

&amp;#x200B;

What this tells me when I look at the bigger picture is they're spending every last red cent they have left to knock GME into the dirt and shake retail out all the while hiding their true exposure by temporarily buying deep ITM calls. They wouldn't be doing this is they thought they could simply short it and make it drop. They don't want us to know they're still short/actively shorting. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I've misunderstood something or gotten something completely wrong please let me know so I can gain a better understanding.
