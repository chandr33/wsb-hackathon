17,m31y4m,"CHWY is on the move. I think it’s good for 100 by next week but hopefully back up to it’s high of 118 from last month.

It is hard to find news on CHWY because every GME article that mentions CHWY Co founder Ryan Cohen is actually talking about his move to GME’s board of directors. 

My position on this is one 81 call expiring 9 April purchased at 6.35 a few days ago. If I would have known they’d bump the earning report from 1 April to 30 March I would have saved some money and bought a 1 April call because this is the catalyst I’m looking forward to. I wish I had the money to properly invest in the stock but I think the call will be worth 500-2000. 
https://ibb.co/XZC9JqQ



Their last four earnings reports have been above estimates.

They’re still expanding operations and not quite profitable yet, but forecasted to be sooner than expected.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chewy-inc-nyse-chwy-expected-052241598.html

Cramer likes CHWY that’s one thing we agree on
https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-would-you-sell-gamestop-now--15593444

People label it a Covid stock but I think they are mistaken. Chewy was able to deliver the medications when vets could not during the crisis.. Nobody is going to pay their vet’s absurd prescription markups or haul their own 50lb bags of kibble after using chewy. Bottom line Chewy saves pet owners time and money and Covid won’t change that. 

Swiss bank UBS downgraded it in January then BOUGHT THE DIP (166000 shares) in early March those dirty dogs! They didn’t quite get the full dip as it was around 100 at the time. Most analysts price targets are around 95-100.

NVAX just dropped the best vaccine news - 100% protection against severe disease (using JnJ’s new twist on words to lower the efficacy bar). Now NVAX has demonstrated best in class efficacy amongst all vax producers and has completed trials that were occurring where escape variants were rampant. 
They will likely still be severely undervalued until UK approval. Market cap is nothing compared to their competitors. 
So many catalysts now imminent - UK approval, US/Mexico trial data, US approval, Canada approval, delivery for billions of doses under contract with several countries, bivalent and multivalent strains currently being mapped while single escape variant strains are in testing and should be approved faster than original strain vaccines according to FDA and MHRA, most well tolerated vaccine (similar to flu shot, same tech), easy transportation and storage (reg fridge temp), superior flu vaccine (Nanoflu) in pipeline according to ph 3 data (past ph 3), Nanoflu has been mentioned as being combined with Covid vaccine for annual jabs, RSV vaccine also in pipeline.
