6,m4eed6,"First off, as an individual who started trading around August 2020, I am incredibly grateful for this community and dumbfounded by the incredibly talented collective of traders active on Reddit. I only started using reddit as an equity/creeptoe resource in January. So thank you for allowing me into your world.

Having watched the deluge of brand new traders flood into Reddit this year (myself being one of them), I’m equal-parts euphoric and terrified. While there are some incredibly wise contributors to the cause of effective retail trading tirelessly pouring their efforts into moderation and quality content, there are 50x the amount of naive, greenhorn traders, many quite young.

As I begin to gain my bearings in this insanely abnormal market and test my ability to stomach volatility, I can’t help but notice a dichotomy forming. A healthy fear of bots and shills is absolutely necessary for the battle we have found ourselves in. But division amongst an army creates a very easy weakness for powerful anti-retail entities to exploit.

I believe the strength of the Reddit army is also its greatest crux: its decentralization. While there are likely hundreds of thousands of wise, experienced traders within the ranks, there are MILLIONS of brand new people here screeching at each other using autism as an excuse.

Autism is a way of life, not a tool for irrational and emotional rejection of anything that does not serve confirmation bias. Reddit has allowed retail traders a chance to not just sit at the table, but flip it over and piss on it. Which we are currently doing (love you fuckers). However, if we begin allowing emotions to take the place of spirited intellectual and informed discussion, we simply won’t amass the momentum needed to bowl these fuckers over.

I’m not saying to take it easy on dummies and dicks, getting rammed for being an idiot is insanely helpful as a young trader. But try at least a LITTLE to have some patience for the n00bs and guide them. They are our children. The most attractive aspect of Reddit imo is the inclusiveness of the community. 

Let’s not lose that spark of magic that brought all of us here to begin with, as millions of young people look to us and this beautiful place to help them take control of their own fates, as we all seek to do with our own.

Thank you for reading my rant. I’m not a shill, I’m not a bot. I’m a dumb ape that doesn’t give financial advice and likes watching banana become bananasquared.",Hear me out guys...,0.91,1615666606,guru916

19,m4el34,"I have reason to ***believe*** this company could lose like 90% of their revenue **OVERNIGHT.**

**Don't** look at my post history unless you need proof **I'm retarded**

I've dumbed down my ***beliefs*** to **2** core reasons

**Their Monetization Model is insane, you have a better chance winning at the casino than you do betting on SKLZ games.**

* On average, players have nearly a 7% statistical edge going to the casino and playing black or red on roulette like a smooth brained dummy fuck (This is literally my favorite way to play roulette so I know what I'm talking about)
* Let me break it down further, going off of the fact that they take 14% of all bets on average(You'll have a hard time finding this on their site - [https://www.skillz.com](https://www.skillz.com/) \- but this Bloomberg article mentions the 14% fee [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/skillz-soars-in-trading-debut-as-investors-bet-on-mobile-esports).
* So let's say you want to make 10 bets on a SKLZ game. You bet $50 on each game, and so does your opponent. The matchmaking system knows to put you with players of similar skill so unsurprisingly, the 10 game streak ends in a 5-5 draw. Both players will have lost $70 in this situation. If the streak went 6-4 in your favor, you would have earn a measly $16 dollars. SKLZ appears to only want to increase this percentage. I refuse to believe this pricing model will have an appeal to mainstream audiences when they see how hard players are getting boned.

**Where does Apple's 30% take of In-App purchases fit in?**

* Of this 14% taken from each betting transaction, what is Apple getting from the cut? I am having trouble finding any evidence that apple is making money from these bets that are taking place on their platform. I have reason to believe that SKLZ may be bypassing Apple's 30% fee, as 14% is clearly less than 30%. SKLZ apps allow you to put money into an account without going through the app store. 
* **Fortnite got banned from the app store for doing exactly this.**
* If games using the SKLZ plugin get banned from the app store, this company will lose all revenue it earns from the App Store. What would this scenario mean for the stock being that it's currently valued around $10 billion dollars as a hyper growth company that doesn't seem to have apps on any other platform?
* In the event Apple is getting a cut, how much are they getting? What kind of special treatment is SKLZ getting from Apple? We need to hear from Apple about this companies monetization model. 
* How much longer is Apple going to allow $200 Million Dollars of revenue to go through at a fraction of what they are typically owed?",Hey 🌈🐻 I got a real juicy 🍌for you - SKLZ,0.67,1615667130,thehumanidiot

29,m4epbm,"Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like ""Stimulus Checks set to arrive...""

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They’re great!**

**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 

**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

***

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/19](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

***

**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest

[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09). Thanks /u/7thprincess 

[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI. People are betting on reopening, sure, but this feels welrd as hell and i love it. 

[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.

[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.

[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.

****

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.
