7,m3mumo,"IMO. Do your own DD. Oil prices are skyrocketing, OPEC announced earlier this month they would not increase production. WTI oil prices right now are 66$ and have been in the 60s for some time now. Analysts have said 80$ to 100$ oil will likely come in 2021 or 2022. $LPI is expanding with the Howard County purchase and recently announced a 75M ATM offering (which seems to be complete now that the SP has broken out of the 33-36 range.) Personally I think the ATM was to get more oil pumping and to take advantage of these high oil prices. (And soon to be even higher). Wells Fargo assisted with the ATM offering and now has come out and increased their PT to 46$, others have even higher PTs right now. 

Let's not forget: Vaccines are WAY ahead of schedule. Recently was announced that all adults will be able to get their shot by May 1. Think about all the pent up travel demand right now, people are itching to travel, hit the beach or head to the mountains. The admin just signed 1400 stimmy checks to most of the gen pop! I bet so many people are going to be using this money for a nice vacation now that they can travel confidently again. 

If you compare $LPI to their competitors they are WAY undervalued. This is an absolute hidden gem that I am sharing with you because you guys/gals have made me $$$ in the past. Yes, I already have boughten shares, and Yes, I am continually buying more. I truly believe this is worth 75$ right now. If oil prices maintain, or even raise then the stock prices follows. At 80$ oil I see the SP value at 90$ and with 100$ oil, I see the SP at 115$.

[And here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lordstown-stock-falls-20-after-short-seller-says-electric-truck-is-a-mirage-11615566973)

One of our favorite EV stocks, RIDE, was added to Hindenburg Research’s Short Sell hit list. This is the same Hindenburg Research that shorted Nikola into oblivion and caused its stock price crash. RIDE Price dropped from $17.81 to $14.22 overnight.

Honestly, I did put a lot of stock into their research and posts thinking/hoping that they were just trying to do us retail investors a solid and let us in on important information and a good exit on a bad stock.

Lately, though, I’m starting to feel like they’re just another Melvin and they’re acting like all of these Hedge Funds that release ‘news’ so they can capitalize on their short sells and make money off of us.

The company is still a solid investment no matter how Hindenburg tries to spin it. You literally couldn’t go wrong by holding it.

But, if you’re looking for another Short Sell / Short Interest stock, this would be a good one to get into at a discount and make some money off of so that we can all dump some more money into GME.

* **Wedbush named Apple one of its ""best ideas"" stocks after recent selling set up a ""great entry point.""**
* **Strong quarterly figures and demand in Asia can lift shares even as investors shift to value names, analyst Dan Ives said.**
* **The firm holds a bull-case price target of $225, implying an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing price.**
* [**Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/join/4np/10-things-opening-bell?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest)**.**

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.

Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

The weakness sets up a ""great entry point"" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.

""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.

Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.

Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.

The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.

The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.

While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.

Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts.","Apple is a 'best idea' pick that can rally up to 86% as tech stocks rebound, Wedbush says",1.0,1615571310,folkwoodswest

61,m3n2y5,"I’m putting a price target of $145 on the shares, representing enormous opportunity from current levels ($79).  Here’s my thesis:  Affirm charges merchants -- including COVID-19 lockdown beneficiary Peloton -- to take on the risk of customers who want to pay with installments. Millennials are driving a change in the traditional idea of paying by credit, and investors now have a way to play that trend in the U. S. Affirm allows consumers to split purchases into installments. The company is modernizing the world of payments by offering an option to make purchases over time without incurring interest for consumers.

Affirm makes money on its ""0% APR"" installment options by taking a cut of the merchant end of the transaction. The idea is that merchants are willing to pay Affirm to conduct risk modeling and offer its service as a way to boost conversion to a sale. The 0% APR options generally nets the company its largest fees from merchants, though it also offers "" simple-interest"" loans through which it receives fixed interest payments on the consumer end as well.

Max Levchin co-founded Affirm in 2012. He has an impressive pedigree as one of PayPal’s co-founders. While everyone recognizes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, you shouldn’t dismiss Levchin’s contribution – he is a powerhouse. We are impressed when someone creates an empire and helps revolutionize the way business is done. We have great faith in him as Affirm’s CEO.

Levchin is a disruptor and is changing the way people pay for goods and how they pay for them over time. Seeking to set the credit card world on its head, the company appeals to both consumers and merchants with a simple, attractive proposition. His vision for the company is to be as “ubiquitous, secure, and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest, and both consumer- and merchant-centric.”

The company is the online lender on the consumer front, and brings clarity on the amount owed and when it is due. A major portion of its business is helping merchants provide 0% financing, and it has signed up major companies like Priceline, Gucci, Dyson, and Expedia. The consumer-centric approach means the company doesn’t charge late fees and interest is not compounded. That is, it is simple interest. The company profits by treating its customers fairly, rather than by gouging them with high interest and unreasonable fees. Profitability is based on growing consumer acceptance, which in turn, makes it more valuable for merchants to offer. For merchants, the company is focused on helping them improve their brand, gain more customers, and increase sales. Affirm earns revenue from this source when it facilitates a sale and payment.

Affirm and Shopify struck an agreement in July through which Shopify would list Affirm as a payment option, giving the company exposure to Shopify's vast base of merchants. Affirm will pay Shopify a fee for each sale processed through its platform, and the company will be Shopify's exclusive partner for such payment options over the course of the arrangement, which lasts three years initially and then subsequently renews for additional one-year terms unless one party decides to discontinue the arrangement.

The company is past the proof-of-concept stage. There are over 6.2 million (!) consumers that have signed up, having completed over 17 million transactions, and the company works with over 6,500 merchants. Gross Merchandise Value\* (GMV) was $10.7 billion over the last three years. Last year, about 64% of its loans were made to repeat customers.

The company went public on January 13th at $49, pricing 25 million shares above the $41 to $44 range. There was strong demand for the IPO. Opening at $91, it reached $103 on the first day of trading. The following day, it went to $138.  Now the stock in trading in the 80s meaning you can get it for less than the IPO.

There is a long runway for continued strong revenue growth that will drive earnings improvement. This will continue fueling the stock.

Founder and CEO Max Levchin controls 20% of the company. Counting him, directors and officers control 31% of the shares. There are very well-known investors that continue to hold major interests. The Founders Fund (a venture capital firm with $3 billion under management, which includes Brian Singerman, Peter Thiel, and Keith Rabois,) has 7%. Khosla Ventures (5%), Lightspeed Ventures (7%), Jasmine Ventures (9%), and Shopify (8%) all have significant ownership. With strong leadership and a unique business model that continues to prove itself, Affirm will continue attracting younger consumers and merchants.

Better development tools, which attracts more developers that make better games, which attracts more players, and gives us a positive feedback loop to jack off in our money pit.

Bam, look at that. **Solid guys doin solid shit.** That's the definition of a company to invest in.


These guys are also businessy AF, they do all sorts of stuff to get money from 8 year olds. They have a pre-made letter you can show your parents to get them to buy you a membership(or they did in 2014 anyways), they have taxes on platform-currency whenever anyone makes a profit, and best of all, they have LIMITED AVATAR ITEMS which you can trade. Limited item day trading back in school is what got me into being an ""investor"" today.

80,m3n7n4,"My only regret is not getting in sooner. I have been looking into GPRO for a while now, and it seems like they are picking up the pace with their current upward trend. I won't pretend to know as much as the pros here, but I can at least speculate on why the stock is rising.  Here is my two cents.

&amp;#x200B;

With their subscription service taking off (up 145% from last year) as the year goes on, it seems the company's shift to a more subscription based model is seeing results, slow results, but still within their expectations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I like seeing companies that attempt to innovate and adapt in order to keep their heads above the water. GPRO's subscription is frankly brilliant. It is aimed directly at their target audience and offers cloud based uploading, a 50% discount on accessories, and a no questions asked camera replacement policy. To me, it looks like GoPro's attempt to stay in the game during and after the pandemic. When the pandemic ends and travel increases, the subscription will remain relevant with current and future consumers. I believe it is a very good change for the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've only eaten enough crayons to understand basic market trends, the current pattern shows a bullish cup-handle pattern and we are currently on the rise. I have no idea what relevant analysis is necessary to predict when it will stop, but my hunch is that we could see the stock rise back up to $12 and possibly $14 if it continues to grow, but that's just me wanting a good life for the wife and her boyfriend.

Not financial advice, just my half-assed DD. I welcome any further insight from smarter degenerates.
