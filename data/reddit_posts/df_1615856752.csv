48,m5xgxp,"First off.....

GOOD JOB YOU FUCKING APES!

$14.04 close on the day and I see a new price target of $2008.01 for many like minded investors. I'll be subscribing to that school of thought myself. Before we continue!

This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Any price targets discussed are those of my own choosing and the decisions to continue to invest are entirely my own and I would not suggest you do anything farther than you're own comfort allows.

We opened at $12.18 after closing at ($11.14 I believe?) On Friday....and then went on to a MONSTEROUS day today closing at $14.04! Awesome. But why?

1. News. 3:00 p.m Friday an article circulated of a short interview with the CEO of $AMC. It was a small glimmer for Apes to come but didn't come to fruition until AH (After Hours). The announcement was the hard line drawn in the sand by the CEO that the LA Market (Largest Market they have) would, 100%, open by this Friday.

2. Volume. 287 million in Volume today. About 200 million Friday. (Probably more, I don't remember). For reference...$GME was only at 24 million....yep. People see where the short is now. Volume will always drive buying activity, even if just for scalping, which always leads to Options, which leads to Gamma (more later).

3. ""Unusual Options activity"". This notice goes out when mad volume of Options are going out. In this particular case....Puts. about 5800 of them for a $9 price target. That's right, more money going AGAINST $AMC. What did you Apes do? That's right. YOU BOUGHT MORE!!!! Not only did this not hurt us, it simply showcased how the stock is being shorted...as if we needed more of that. But the more the merrier.

4. Gamma Build Up (Calls expiring ITM). No, we are not yet In a Gamma Squeeze. This has all been organic growth, which is far better in the long term. HOWEVER. 2 Weeks ago we landed the much needed $8.01. This lead to calls expiring ITM. (This doesn't always guarantee bought shares, more later)

-The Following week we close at $11. Once again...more ITM option calls, which leads to today. Pre-Market took us above $12 putting more calls ITM, which lead to $13 quickly doing the same. And the we found a new support base around $14. This is all chasing the $15 Option Mark where we have TONS of support waiting. 

5. The Witching Hour. Quadruple Witching on the EXACT SAME DAY $AMC Launches it's largest Market. Very frightening for Short positions that have been consistently losing millions.

Options Explained, FAQ
 Because there is A LOT of confusion on this.

- Do Options expiring ITM guarantee bought shares? Not necessarily. 

-Why? Because when your Option goes ITM and you ""Sell-To-Close"" you are selling the option contract back to the Exchange, not another human being.

-If the Exchange is buying it, don't they still need to buy Shares? Kinda. If they already have the shares, which they do, most of the time, then no, but they have to constantly purchase and sell shares through the exchange so as the Gamma builds up and raises the prices then the exchanges are paying more money for the shares which nets the outcome we are all looking for, which is BOUGHT SHARES. The more Options expiring ITM, also inspires massive Buying activity (always) whoch results in more people buy Shares (including other hedgies and whales who also want the price to go up) which leads to a constant feed back loop.

TL;DR: Options drive Buying Power and help raise the stock price even though they do not directly influence share price when bought or sold. $AMC has big things coming. Buy &amp; Hold, Rinse &amp; Repeat!

Then when my wife’s boyfriend asked if we could get one, it really made me think that maybe there was more to this brand then those commercials of beds folding up grandma. It was hard to get into a mattress store in 2020 and lay down on a mattress to test it out but they were still able to double 2019 EPS. 2021 earnings is forecasted to be 25% higher than last, implying a forward PE of less than 16.

Earlier today we saw a crazy amount of interest in RKT call options, not to mention the fact that TDA is restricting the shorting of GME and RKT. 

Personally, seeing that GME dropped so much today made me realize that people were getting bored with it and hopping into AMC. We cannot let that happen, hedge funds open new shorting positions any time they see an all time high and they take their profits when we lose interest. A squeeze won’t be achievable if we let them buy back in for cheaper than they got them.

85,m5xod2,"I've seen some people put all their chips on one color, and then quickly see their hard-earned (or not) cash go down the drain. Here is a better way to create a position:

1. No one knows the top or bottom. If you want 10, 100, or 250 shares/option contracts, break your orders into smaller parts (or multiples of 100 shares). Buy some now, watch the ticker, then buy some more, perhaps wait for the next day(s) to complete your position. This way you'll get a better average entry price and if the stock tanks before you are done buying and the reasons for getting in don't change, you can get in at a better point. If the stock spikes before you are done, oh well, just remember how many times the price has jumped after you buy. Right.

**If you are looking to own shares:**

2a. If you can't afford to buy multiples of 100 shares, make sure to place limit orders, never market orders.

2b. If you are buying shares in multiples of 100, specially for stocks with high volatility, instead of placing an order for shares, sell to open a put contract at the money. ""But, pretentious internet stranger, WTF does that mean?"" I am glad you asked:

Let's say you have $22,000 to gamble. Instead of placing a limit order for 100 shares at $220, place an order to Sell to Open 1 put contract with 3/19 expiration at $220 strike, with a limit price premium of $41 (or $4,100 per contract). Your $22,000 will become collateral for that trade and you would not be able to dispose of it. The $4,100 will be added to your account.

**Two outcomes:**

1. If by 3/19 the stock is below $220, you will be assigned 100 shares purchased at $220 each and you will get to keep the $4,100 premium from the short put. So if the price is above $179, you would've made more money than if you had purchased the stock outright. If it's below $179, well, you are still the owner of the shares that you were willing to own anyway.

2. If by 3/19 the stock is above $220, your $22,000 will be released and you will get to keep the $4,100 premium. Money magically added to your account (a poor 🌈🐻 lost by buying that put tho). You won't have the stock, but you'll be a little richer and ready to do the same next week until you get the shares assigned. There is an opportunity cost if the stock skyrockets and you miss the upside. If that concerns you, then you can short a more ITM put to ensure you get assigned. The premium for 1 short 3/19 $230p would be at $4,700, so your breakeven goes up to $183.

Don't forget to sell covered calls if you are planning to hold on to those shares for a while. but that's another story)

WSB TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀$IRWD🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc is a strong buy out candidate due to their flagship drug Linzess and its current partnerships, a otherwise very limited pipeline, recent unexpected CEO exit, and (most importantly) large insider share purchase from activist investor Alex Denner of Sarissa Capital whose focus is on increasing shareholder value usually through forced acquisition

**The Thesis**

**Product**
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals ($IRWD) is a biotech company that focuses on gastrointestinal drugs. They currently have one major drug, Linzess (linactolide), which is a novel action drug used to treat IBS which was approved in 2012. Since that time, it has been an excellent drug and has steadily been making consistent revenue for Ironwood (~$400M revenue in 2020, $106M GAAP income). They are partnered with AbbVie for US brand and commercialization collaboration, this is key as they could be a potential suitor. In Japan they are partnered with Astellas, and in China with AstraZeneca.  Ironwood's other pipeline products have either been unsuccessful over the past 5 years or are pre-clinical (ie so early they don't yet provide much value and in fact cost a lot of money in valuation). This has been destroying shareholder value as all the money made by Linzess is not being reflected in the share price and the company is not doing well on developing another blockbuster drug.

**Sarissa Capital and Alex Denner**
In case you aren't involved much in biotech, Alex Denner is the big swinging dick no board member wants in their company. Mainly because his MO is to infiltrate your board, buy up a bunch of the company, and then leverage it to increase shareholder value (his own mostly, but also he says yours). Usually this means sale of the company. He started out under Carl Icahn at Icahn Partners but then spun off and started his own company Sarissa Capital. Here are the last three company's he has been involved with: Ariad (Takeda purchased for $5.2 billion), Bioverativ (Sanofi purchased for $11.6 billion), and The Medicines Company (Novartis acquiring for $9.7 billion). All of these were at premiums around 50-75% of current traded share price. 

**Alex Denner and Ironwood history**
Sarissa approached Ironwood in 2018 about Denner joining their board. From a news article at the time, ""But after three meetings with Denner to better understand his intentions for the company, Ironwood’s executives decided they weren’t thrilled with the prospect of him on their board. In a statement, the company said Sarissa hadn’t made a strong enough case to appoint Denner, considering the boards existing diversity."" Here was Denner's response after the share price jumped 10+% at news of his interest: “To the extent that they state in their press release that they’re concerned with what investors want, I’ve been told that more value has been created for Ironwood shareholders today than in any single day in their history.” Fucking legend. [Full press release here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sarissa-capital-issues-statement-on-ironwood-pharmaceuticals-300657237.html) centered on how Ironwood should be improving shareholder value. 

While Ironwood initially rebuffed him joining their board in 2018, they did implement many of his recommendations from the press release above. Namely, separating their R&amp;D division into its own separate company instead of funneling all of the great revenue their flagship and established drug was producing into failing pipeline drugs. 

Then in late 2019, they all the sudden let him join the board. His comment at the time, “I look forward to working with my fellow board members to create value at Ironwood.” 4 month later in 2/2021, the CEO of only 2 years steps down rather unexpectedly and an interim CEO is implemented. 1 month later, Denner starts buying up shares. 

**Insider buying**
So I noticed that Denner bought about $13M in shares on 3/02 which was shortly after the announcement of the CEO leaving, this brought up his ownership to over the SEC rule of 5% meaning he now needed to file a Form 4 every time he made another purchase. This seemed pretty fucking suspicious timing wise with the CEO leaving so I've spent the last few days looking into Denner's history and prior involvements with other biotech companies, particularly those that were bought out. While I was doing this, the motherfucker bought $10M more shares in large batch orders (one on 3/05 and 3/10). I strongly suspect he has actually bought much more than this because there have been several large block purchases over the past few days as well. But the forms for &gt;20% owners SEC reporting are different than if you are say a ~10% owner and I suspect these take longer to come through (10 day allowance per the SEC). So I will be on the lookout for if a Form 13-G from Denner comes through the SEC. I am not the most knowledgable about the SEC form requirements so I could be off base here.

With the recent purchases, IRWD has become Sarissa Capitals largest portion of their portfolio (total value around $1 billion) at 16.32%, [see here](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/sarissa-capital-management-lp)

**How I am playing this**
The timeline is difficult to assess on this. At earliest, the purchase would not likely be for 6 months given SEC rules on insider buying. Thats even if he plans to create a buyout at all. I belive given Denner's history, the lack of pipeline, the pre-existing commercial partnerships, and need for more global footprint of this drug the best option is to sell to AbbVie or some other large partner. I do not see Denner attempting to buy all of these shares just to install a more shareholder friendly CEO.

Given that the timeline is variable and possibly mid to long term. I bought shares and calls in August and leaps for Jan 2021 at $15 and $20 strike. I think a bear case buyout would be $15 and best case would be $25 but I expect somewhere around $20 given his previous history. The leaps were just added today so the premiums are inflated but I will be looking to buy more of these over the next few weeks to months. The August calls were cheap as dirt. I will be following the options prices closely and adding a bunch more as the buying power of options is much higher than straight shares and I have strong conviction this sale will happen in 2021.
