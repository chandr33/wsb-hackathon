As you may already know there was an article produced by @wmwitkowski for Market Watch about the 'GME Roller-coaster' that saw the price drop dramatically today. Please find below the proof that this article was not only RELEASED PRIOR TO THE DROP... But even written AT LEAST 14 hours beforehand. How long has this been scheduled??? 

Yes this little rat has sold his soul. But who is giving the orders? He went private on his twitter and deleted his posting of the article.

Its INSANE how disgustingly negligent they have been here. How can they play us like absolute fools, right before our eyes. With conclusive proof of a rigged media, it just makes me even more hellbent on winning this fight.

Hold strong you fucking apes. This only invigorates further outrage. 

Huge credit to @MrDavidNio for his detective work. I am just the ape hoping this message gets to you retards. 

TLDR: Market Watch has been exposed in producing news about the GME drop today. They released the article 14 hours before hand as shown through a Google search of the article. It was even published prior to the drop. Insane negligence.

54,m2dl0y,"My first post and I wanted to share my crayon drawings with the class. 

All were going to look at today are fibonacci levels on long-medium-short timeframes. 

I was out of the country without cell phone during the last pump, and after total disbelief of what you animals did I starting reading all the good work you've done and cant even begin to describe how happy I am I did so. Thank you for the comraderies mateys.

**TL;DR GME loves the fibs and I do too.** The stock held above a key level today after the bounce and they show further upside to the next levels.

This does not constitute financial advice. I like the stock. Im holding shares to 100k because then I can say ""I save businesses"" ~~in my resume.~~  Wont need one. 

&amp;#x200B;

**FIB #1**

Overall Fib of entirety of GME, from its 2008 high to its 2020 lows. 

\- I can go into more detail on previous fib action but really - it holds its levels between 63.77 previous ATH and 2.57 very very well. Old data who cares. 

\- Look how, right after close on 1/28, it hit the 8.2 fib ALMOST EXACTLY. Then following fell to the .618 exactly where we began this second run we all care more about. note: this includes after hours data, which is only for demo purposes on this chart and not normally used.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/6z1kIDM8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6z1kIDM8/)

Now if I zoom in to the most recent price action using overall fib (not looking at AH anymore, zoomed in to what matters to us now)

\- Look how well the daily price open/close adhere to this fib

\- All these crayon scribbles are trying to point to fib levels being respected (they love it)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WHa2TCEV/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WHa2TCEV/)

\- Today we flipped and held the 4.236. Honestly I like the 6.85 as next level but lets take a look at the next retracement to see if that holds true

&amp;#x200B;

**FIB #2**

From ATH to DFV post-SEC ""I like the stock"" double down at \~$40 in Feb (right when I was getting back and didnt know who this guy was or what was going on)

If we overlay these fibs, we get a lot of confluences from the overall fibs. I left my crayon drawings here for you to see how well they align - even better so. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WLXo5v4W/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WLXo5v4W/)

ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I understand there are fractals blah blah blah, but I literally drew lines from 2008/2013 and they match up perfectly with what has happened over the past month and a half. 

Heres without the crayons...do your own analysis

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/5ePPW0xm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5ePPW0xm/)

Consolidation under the .236 lead to ape rockets we've enjoyed this week. Clear break and hold of the .5 which is usually a tough level. This is good as usually .5 rejects, and I see upside tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIB #3**

Zooming in to the most recent price action all of which occurred on Feb 26 - check this out - 

Crayon drawings: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/T9nDqsOH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/T9nDqsOH/)

Like Ronald im lovin it...why?

\- Consolidation at 1 lead to pop to 1.6

\- Consolidation at 1.6 lead to pop to 2.6

\- 2.6 came back to 1, rebounded and held the 1.6

\- Naturally form here expecting it to ride up to the 3.4-3.618 level *in the short term.* Probably bobble there before continue to 4.236 which just so happens to coincide with....thanks for paying attention... ATH. Exactly. Whoa.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIB #4** (ok I only said three but this small one is for funsies)

This one was created today, and is just to demonstrate how some arbitrary line coinciding with some magical sequence of numbers found in nature can help predict price action, maybe. 

5 minute chart from high to low today

Ill hold the crayolas just to reduce distraction:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/z7QmPLbd/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/z7QmPLbd/)

\- Note the drop frontran the the 8 daily ema/tapped the 15 min 200s (not pictured). also think of this as a retest of the first breakout - confirming as now support.

&amp;#x200B;

**SO WHATS NEXT?**

Fibs can be used in trends to help give targets. So from Fib #3 our target would be 1.6 and 2.4 for example near term. And next I told you 3.4-3.6 then I believe 4.2 which coincides magically with the ATH. Its a ladder....Price moves up, consolidates, maybe comes back down to test its footing, then can take two steps ahead. Maybe one step back for two steps forward, IDK. 

Todays big flush from a technical perspective was a good step back and we held the line perfectly, with a solid rebound and consolidation above the natural fib levels. Some idiot market sold a couple million shares, cascading im sure stop losses other idiots have, while apes gobbled them back up like banana. Expect some FUD like what happened today along with rumors, etc. to get us apes to paper hands.

This is the kind of fuckery they will do to try and shake ape from tree. Ape dont fall. Ape climb higher.

On Fib #1 (green) we have levels at roughly $320, $420 (nice), $520, and $730 (note: IDK what comes after 12, so its 100k)

On Fib #2 (orange) we have levels at roughly $315, $390, $505 (previous ATH in AH), $600, $750, $1200

On fib #3 (blue) we have levels at roughly $345 where we hit this AM, $420 hehehe to $445, $505, $600, and $765, $900, $1274

On fib #4 (although not weighted highly) we get  $280, $310, $350 todays high, $400, $450, $635, $775-810, $920

There are too many lines on one chart to really get a decent idea, but lets look for confluence of above

1) Needs to get back to todays high $350, break up

2) Then push to ATH in the $500 range. I expect a slight selloff at previous ATH, then break up where the fun really begins

3) Next we have a lot of confluence in the $730 - $760 range 

4) Then moon if this isnt it. I cant count any higher anyways, but plan to hold on until this hit the planet....wait for it...of the apes. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Note the similarity to the movie. Humans think they hot stuff. They fuel rocket. Rocket goes to outer space. When rocket comes back, world is changed. This is what we are all doing. One share at a time, we are changing the world.* ^(Dont read too hard in to this analogy its taken me two hours to get to this point and its time for banana.)

Between the price and the volume, there's not too much that pops out to me, although it's interesting to see we had almost equal volume at the first half way down the dip as we did coming back up.

[Shorts available from IborrowDesk: https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/gme ](https://preview.redd.it/raoaj56kiam61.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d178522e25d6eac6653cea50eb8a959cab488166)

What's interesting to see with the available shorts there's something interesting going on:

Quick note, XRT &amp; GAMR have GME in their ETF baskets, so it's been used as a proxy to short GME. Obviously shorting a single share of XRT and GAMR is equivalent to shorting a partial share of GME. GAMR is kind of irrelevant, give it's low volume, but can still play a minor role.

So here's the picturing I'm seeing:

3/4: life is good (short borrow rates for XRT = 3.1%, GME = 1.9%)

3/5: life is good, but let's back off our shorts a little bit for some ammo next week. Short positions for GME &amp; XRT slightly decrease for Monday's assault (short borrow rates for XRT = 3.1%, GME = 1.7%)

3/8: We've seen worse, but let's get ahead of this before we get into trouble. We'll use half the GME shorts so we can kill momentum (short borrow rates for XRT = 3.1%, GME = 1.7%)

3/9: Oh shit, we're in damage control mode. let's back off GME and go all in with XRT so we have some GME ammo for tomorrow. This is also where other GME shorts at $200+ probably took big L's and had to cover (short borrow rates for XRT = 3.1%, GME = 1.7 - 2.6%)

3/9: Today looked interesting to me. First off, GME short swooped back in at $270-ish? But the XRT positions from yesterday seemed to have been squeezed out over night. I'm expecting new shorts on XRT for tomorrow.

**If we look at the available short shares and price movements, the big nosedive we took today was likely a paper hand institution taking money off the table or transferring shares from one big player to another.** I would have expected to see people going ham on XRT and GME shorts around the dip, but this really didn't happen. Also, take a moment think about how you would exit a position with 10,000 shares without causing a massive selloff. You have to drive prices up, in the price book so enough buy orders will fill in beneath you, then you sell a bunch on the market. 

However there's great news! First, **WE STILL HERE**. Second, these new shorts will be easy to pop at the 270 - 300 level. Third, if the whales caused a 50% drop with a large sale, it means the **FLOAT IS GETTING BONE DRY. Buckle my dudes &amp; dudets.**

So what does it all mean? keep hodling:

1)  Shorter windows are great!  98% of the revenue for a theatrical release window is in the first 30 days.  99% in the first 45 days.  

2) Studios want 60 day theatrical windows.  No Problem

3) There is no place you can get that LARGE FORMAT entertainment experience.  Even those lucky enough to have a home theater, don't have 100 foot screens!

7:50 pm ET March 10, 2021 (CFRA) PrintGME is up over 50% since March 8, when GME announced the formation of a committee that will be led by Ryan Cohen and is focused on accelerating GME's tech transformation. Given no material changes to its business model were conveyed, we believe rapid rise up in shares is unwarranted, less about future prospects, and more of a statement about social &amp; economic inequality. We draw parallels to 2011's Occupy Wall Street Movement, which splintered off into other movements, albeit reemerging in smaller 'Reoccupy' formats in 2013 and 2015. In our view, we're witnessing a 'Reoccupy GME' movement, following Feb.'s splintering off into silver, doggie-coin and other financial instruments. We lift our 12-month target by $7 to $16, a price-to-FY 22 (Jan.) sales multiple of 0.2x, above 3-year historic average, reflecting GME's ability to more readily tap markets for cash.  Bearish catalysts include developments in regulatory probe opposing investors, and earnings on March 23, noting our sales/EPS estimates are below Street.",CFRA MAINTAINS SELL OPINION ON SHARES OF GAMESTOP CORP.,1.0,1615423417,X_fuggedaboudid

Comparing IVR to other REITs such as NYMT, MFA, and MITT,  I can't help but think that it's just lying dormant and about to explode any day now. Here's why:

\- Prior to COVID it was sitting comfortably between $11 and $23 for the past 15 years!- If you look back at 2008 you will see a very similar waterfall to what you saw in March when COVID hit, and it took less then a year for an almost complete bounce-back.  If history repeats itself, you're looking at an over 500% growth potential in a year (probably more though.)

\- It traditionally had a dividend yield of around 10-15%; They are currently at 8.5% (and rising)- They had some issues paying off their margin, but according to their last earnings report, they've managed to pay off all their debt, and they also exceeded earnings estimates.  They did need to sell off a few properties; not the end of the world though.

\- Are lower mortgage rates detrimental to a REIT??I honestly don't know.  Please let me know what you think.  I do know that property values have dropped; that seems like a positive to me.

\- and finally; just overall stability.  I think that $1.95 low right after COVID  was rock bottom. They are a business, they are adapting and making good decisions that are keeping them in the green and continuing to grow.  They only saw a 10% dip during last weeks down market and are currently continuing to hold their upward trend line very nicely. With the market currently going nuts, they have excellent market resistance.

If a $4 share with an 8.5% dividend becomes a $15 share with a 12% dividend; You're going from $0.34 to $1.80 per share, per year, basically for the rest of your life in the form of dividends.

That's almost a 50% ANNUAL return on investment!
