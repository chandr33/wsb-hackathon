10,m27nx6,"Hi,

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I just don't understand it.

I'm using Fidelity, which has no commissions.

I buy a stock for, let's say $10 per share.  Fidelity shows a notification with the number of shares I bought, plus the exact price per share, which matches ($10).

I then put the stock into my stock tracking app with the number of shares and price per share.

But let's say a week later I check on the stock.

My tracking app shows the correct info and shows that the stock has gone up to $11 and I'm up $100 (10 shares).

However, when I go into the Fidelity app and look at that stock, it shows my ""Total Cost Per Share"" as $12 and shows my ""Total Gain/Loss"" to be a $100 loss.

Obviously I'm just using easy numbers here, but they do accurately represent what's happening.  I know that the price I get the stock for is a little higher than Fidelity gets it for, so they can make money.  That's fine.  But.....

* This is a big difference.
* What does ""Total Cost Per Share"" even mean?
* I thought that whatever price they gave me in the ""Order Completed"" notification should accurately reflect what I paid for the stock, no?

Can anyone help me understand this please?

24,m27ow9,"TL;DR The time stamp and numbers on my $800 market buy don’t add up. They filled my order DURING my second attempt to cancel and AFTER 146 seconds of waiting for the cancel. I had placed the order at $262.46 but they filled it at $270 instead, and 15 seconds after it was filled it was going for $23-$27 lower on its way back up. I have a screen recording of this but don’t know how to post it.

Explanation: 

When the stock fell to 198$ I wasn’t aware until it was on its way back up. At 12:55 I **instantly** transferred $800 for a market order and was able to **instantly** place the $800 market order at $262.46 (12:55).

Once I realized they threw the switch again I started screen recording (12:55) but I don’t think I can share videos on this sub. (If you know how I could do that, please tell me and I’ll post it if it’s significant; or not bother if it was just ordinary RH bullshit)

At 12:56 I pressed cancel and it started loading to cancel my order. I waited exactly 61 seconds (now 12:57) before abandoning that screen to see if it would work after reloading the tab. I went through a couple tabs on the app (share price was still at $262.46) and at 12:57 I tried cancelling again and just waited. This time I waited 85 seconds exactly until shortly after 12:59 when the cancel icon disappeared.

I was watching the “cancel” loading screen the second time around from **12:57-12:59**. At **12:59** my order partially filled with 2.5 shares @270, with the cancel loading icon still spinning, and then moments later the rest of my $800 order was filled at the same price with a receipt time of **12:58** and the cancel icon disappeared.

This last part could be my fault for not using a limit order but at 12:55 the price peaked at $269 (even though when I placed the order *and* checked at 12:55 &amp; 12:57 it said $262.46). 15 seconds after the rest of my order filled (12:59), I checked the going price and when the screen loaded it instantly went UP from $242.78 to $246.73. I spent those 15 seconds stunned in disbelief at how fucking retarded this whole thing was, so it *could’ve* been $270.00 exactly 15-18 seconds before, **but I fucking doubt it.**

Is this a thing that should fucking happen? I feel like I got fucked. The only reason I use RobinHood still is because I started an account before their fuckery as a novice and didn’t want to transfer my portfolio to another app in case it would fuck me up. How serendipitous.

Anyway, still bought the dip 💎🙌🚀🍀",Did RobinHood intentionally fuck me when they threw the second breaker?,1.0,1615408349,DJ_Clitoris

When I went to execute the warrants TD told me that they couldn't because they never received the terms. After going back and forth for a week or so, I found the company managing the warrants, got in touch with the manager, and she gave me the terms. I passed those and the managers contact info on to TD who had been telling me that they were reaching out and getting no response. 

Then they told me that they couldn't accept them from me and could provide no further info other than they were reaching out and not getting a response. I continued to check in with the manager who confirms no one from TD has reached out. I've been following up with TD for weeks and every week the story changes - first the terms didn't exist, then they do but we have to formally receive them from AYR, then they were telling me it's a conflict with the custodian in the Canadian Branch of TD and they have no control over that, then it was something with their depository... it's gotten insane. I can't tell if TD is just being lazy, if they're incompetent, or what in the hell is going on here. They're client service people just read off a screen and have no idea what they're saying and just reference their ""back office"" and ""custodians"" who you can't talk to.

80,m27si4,"I joined this FB group roughly the same time I joined WSB and GME threads. Back when I was just learning about the situation with short interest and market manipulation. This investment group is a traditional investment community, and it is simply mindblowing to me that people on the institutional side of this are either turning a blind eye in ignorance, or are actually stupid enough to believe the HF and MM will be on the right side of this GME saga leaving retail bag holding. 

Don't get me wrong, I think OP was more so just illustrating that some of retail will inevitably be hurt in the long run - especially if they have no exit strategy and just continue to hold. But the fact that he is citing CNBC as a credible source regarding any information on GME is astounding.

This really illustrates and cements why WSB and GME communities are so valuable right now. The only legitimate information I've sourced over the last 2 months has by and large come from Reddit. WHICH IS INSANE. An online community with diversity and retail interest at heart, is MORE factual and accurate than every single media outlet, all gov't bodies, regulators, banks. 

It's fucking ridiculous how much purposeful misinformation has been spread to create FUD by these institutions.

They do not want to lose wealth. They do not want to lose power. And they certainly do not want the common man/woman to be wealthy and free from corporate slavery. What happens to all these corporations if people don't NEED to work to pay bills? If they don't have slaves to ""employ"" they can't achieve their monopoly goals. This is the entire capitalist market as it stands, it has been created this way on purpose. Keep the 99% poor and on the verge of financial ruin, debt, up to their fucking eyeballs, so they have to spend their entire lives working for us, the 1%.

They keep us down, so they can be built up with our work, our sweat and blood.

Obviously this goes without saying, you'd have to be brain damaged to assume any of the movement on GME has been organic. It's the most manipulated stock on Earth.

All you need to do is buy more and hold. 

We haven't even approached Gamma or Short squeeze yet.  
When it happens be safe, and cash out. Be realistic about how high you think this stock will go.

There are tons of people online saying 1k, 10k, 100k, but please limit your expectations. For the vast majority of retail if this stock actually hits 1k they will have made enough money to clear their debt. 

Don't downvote this just because I'm saying to cash out. It's important for retail to keep a realistic expectation so that there aren't bag holders losing their life savings. 

Having said that, given all the information we know, this squeeze is a matter of time, and this stock will skyrocket sooner or later. Holding and buying more is the best thing we can do to put the pressure on HF and MM so they are forced to close their positions for huge losses.

***The goal has always been a transfer of wealth. You get to decide how much.***

TLDR; GME buy, hold, repeat, wait for it to skyrocket, dump it, clear your debt, start retirement savings, start a business. Take the power away from the 1%

I pulled the raw data from the candlesticks, so it's not perfect, there is some variance.

There was a coordinated sell off, obviously, in my opinion.

I ran the raw numbers and 5,284,930 shares were sold in the 8 data candlesticks.  I discounted the last 737,090 shares sold as investors jumping ship.

That means 4,557,740 shares sold, avg value $290 a share, or $1,322,187,351. Yes, that's Billion.

8.44 % of all GME stocks (54M available to the public) were sold in 63 seconds over 6 halts.

If I include the 737,090, its $1.584 Billion sold, from 5.284M shares, or 9.79% of publicly available gamestop shares.

I feel it was a coordinated strike. It was well timed to catch investors calm and collected during a great ride up.

This is the unfortunate situation due to low volume trading, back in February a 1M sell was common, just a simple attack.  But because the trading volume being low, 10k units here, 16k there, 1M pounds down just as much as it increases.
