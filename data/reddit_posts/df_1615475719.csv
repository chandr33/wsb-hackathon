It is the momentum that drives not only us but all phenomena both seen and unseen. GME is the movement, movement pushes forward. Movement is change and change is inevitable. The hedgies are not changing, they are not movement, their time has come and gone. They are the anti-movement. They are the dam artificially constructed to stop the natural flow.

Well, about GME, I read some posts and comments about people Who believe in GME... 
I would like clear explication because some of you still believe GME could reach 500 or 800 or 1000 per share. 
I don’t understand how could You still believe that ? Especially, since what happenned yesterday.
For me yesterday it wasnt normal ! It wasnt fair ! They dont let GME reach 360dollars, they tried to broke us (and they broke some of us). So How could you believe they will do nothing of GME go higher ???

In january they did the same. And after GME never reach the same level of price/share. 2 days after GME Reach a certain price but Never the same.

SomeTimes, i sadly think that they will « play » with us everytime... So that mean that GME Max it should be around 350 dollars and min around 50 dollars.

Yesterday, i read à comment. Before opening. Someone talk about this dip. He wrote about GME who would reached 350/400 and then big dip...
I know that every people speculate, as me, but sometimes when someone speculate not like we would love, we don’t pay attention. I don’t find this comment now...",Futur of gme,1.0,1615476008,thianah
