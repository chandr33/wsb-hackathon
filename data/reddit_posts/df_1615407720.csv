1. Ford MACH-E (EV SUV) turned out to be a EV hit, stealing market share primarily from $TSLA, $TSLA reduction in market share was almost 100% a loss to Ford.
2. The stock is still discounted compared to the sector - it has forward P/E of \~12 vs \~16 for the sector, a %33 discount in price
3. Technically, it looks like it's mooning

PERKS: James Farley (new Ford's CEO since last year) really likes your wife and want to be her BF.

As far as I understand it is either an issue with Fidelity Trader Pro's ability to keep up with trading... orrr it's sell limits that have been set around $340 that are being hit by market buys? Which, again.. am retarded, but if the latter is accurate then would that mean there is a massive amount of volume on low liquidity, as in there are no few shares available but everyone is trying to trade? 

Is that at all reasonable to assume? Is anyone else seeing these ridiculous candle wick spikes? I saw them in reverese back when GME tanked early Feb.

High Frequency Trading (HFTs) is basically algorithms trading with each other all day long. Famously, they caused what’s known as “The Flash Crash,” feel free to google it. 

Essentially one of the algos goes haywire and triggers the other algos to start selling against each other. The entire way down they hit your stop losses (I can’t believe you paper handed bitches set stop losses) and continues down. Then when they run into a big buy order they freeze and look around. (I would talk about liquidity here but you’re too retarded). Then they reevaluate and return to the average of the mean price. If you recall, this happened when Elon tweeted “Price too high IMO.” They trade the news, tweets, etc.

Fundamentally nothing has changed. Shorts are still fuk. GME still moon. Don’t panic and blow up your account.

The time frame I’m looking at it’s alt lease several years, its not a short time position … jus the development of different treatment will take years
