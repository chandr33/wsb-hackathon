It is excellent to see the community HODLing together and giving back in their own ways, over $300Ks were raised in couple of days for Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.. Wow!!

I also wanted to do my bit and so I thought of contributing to support this platform (Reddit) and community by buying Reddit premium. I know that there are several other options but I believe that the platform and community that HODLs us together also deserve giving back. Besides supporting the platform, the monthly coins that you get can be used to glide/award the posts/users, which is a great form of encouragement on Reddit. 

Wherever you chose to Give Back, Do SHARE those ideas. Apes together strong and make a huge impact.

Here are some other ideas that I forked out from another thread:

Embracer   Group is noted on the Swedish First North  exchange which is not as  regulated as ""normal"" exhanges are. There is  also not the same ruleset  for tax in most countries so be aware of this.  It is also said to be  more risky investments.

They operate in the game development and publishing business and I don't really need to dive into the prospect of this sector.

Embracer Group ([EMBRAC-B.ST](https://embrac-b.st/))   is the parent company of several development and publishing business   within the gaming industry and throughout most platforms including   mobile, console and PC.

To name a couple of well known items in their IP inventory:

* Valheim (if you don't know yet this is going to be a catalyst)
* Saints Row
* Goat Simulator

**The company**

They  operate Koch Media, Cofee Stain, Amplifier, Saber, Deca and a group  containing banned chars (similar to a ticker) as operative groups.

They hold 220+ IP's, 59 development studios, the 6 above operative groups with 5500+ people in 40+ countries.

*Strategic plans*

Grabbing from the 2019/2020 annual report page 6 highlights:

* Investment for long-term growth
* Growth through M&amp;A
* Empowerment through decentralization (reference to several dev. and pub. branches)
* Reinvesting profit to increase growth

*Let's see what they've done about it* with referencing their press releases ([https://embracer.com/news-media/](https://embracer.com/news-media/)):

* 2021-02-03: Merge with Easybrain (Mobile games as Sudoku and so on)
* 2021-02-03: Acquires Aspyr Media (Star Wars, Sid Meier's Civilization etc.)
* 2021-02-03: Merge with Gearbox Entertainment Company (Borderlands)
* 2020-11-18: Acquires Flying Wild Hog (Shadow Warrior series)

...

Seems like they took M&amp;A serious.. If you're interested, theres a presentation of the M&amp;A actions here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update\_Feb\_3\_2021-ny.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update_Feb_3_2021-ny.pdf)

We   can't go about without mentioning Valheim. The viking survival game   that is currently running early access on Steam and had over 4 million   buys came February. The game has taken the industry with storm. As of   writing there's 18k viewers on twitch which is close to Overwatch and   Hearthstone.

It was release the 2nd of February through Steam with a 96% positive feedback.

**Financials (*****sort of*****)**

First   looking at the gaming market which has been reported from 2018 to 139   billion USD to 2019 ranging in 152 billions. Estimates for 2022 is  close  to 200 billion.

Second,  insider  holdings. The insiders account for 52.7% of the shares with  35.5% being  on institutional hands. The remainder for trade is 11.8%.

The Q4 report arrrives the 20th of May.

The report is a bit difficult for my smooth brain to compare since the previous year is for 15 months so bear with me.

Net sales grew from \~4603m SEK to \~5249m SEK.

Operational EBIT grew from \~717m SEK to \~1033m SEK.

I'm not yet that experiences in reading the financial reports so I won't bore you with my mistakes. It can be found here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf)

From   my limited knowledge I see increases on almost all areas worth noting   which is also impressive considering that the previous period is a 15   month period (I don't know why).

Then the Wirecard thriller started and the 35.500€ unfortunately quickly became 20.000€ again :D. After that I took a creative break and licked my wounds. 

From August I dared again (but with less risk) and earned 5.000€ until the beginning of December. The DE30 was relatively high and I had the feeling that it would fall again. I then speculated with short KO on the DE30 and what happened the next day? The German Health Minister announced at a press conference that vaccination will begin earlier than planned. 

The DE30 went up and up and came closer and closer to my KO threshold and so slowly I started to get a little nervous. I bought 10,000 shares at a price of 1.52€, so 15,200€ invested (I know not exemplary but I was aware of the risk). At **0,72** I set a stop loss and the price came closer and closer to the stop loss. Suddenly it was so far, the stop loss was triggered and the KO sold with a loss of 8,000€. However, the price only fell to **0.71€**, i.e. **one cent** below my stop loss, before it rose to **3.21€** on the same day. So instead of making 16,900€ profit on two days I made 8,000€ minus because of this one cent.

74,m6fgy7,"No advice will be found here just one apes thoughts.

Now imma tell this as I understand it, please do correct me if I'm wrong. Also explaining this also helps me to understand it.

Imagine one GME share is equal to one 🍌, we can understand that. Now, the 🐻🌈 see those Gamestop shares as mouldy 🍌, so they think that they will be worthless and decided to say to Gamestop, ""We'll buy those 🍌 now"" back in 2020 when this all started, with an agreement that they would sell those exact 🍌back to Gamestop in the future for a lower value. (That's how a short works).

Now the man, myth and not cat [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) comes in and sees that actually its just a mouldy skin on the 🍌and the inside is pure gold. He decides he wants to buy lots of the mouldy 🍌because he sees their deep fucking value. He posts some of his findings on the 🍌 forums and people are excited and want to buy gold 🍌.

Now it's January and lots of apes are buying many 🍌 that hopefully will be gold inside, but they're not sure. The deadline for the 🐻🌈 to return those mouldy 🍌 for less, is fast approaching, but they already sold their mouldy 🍌 to make their gains when they first bought them. But with all the potential of these being gold 🍌 , there are no 🍌 left in the gamestop shop. 🐻🌈 are now scared.

Apes started to peel open their 🍌 around Jan w/c 25th. Apes would've made big tendies if apes opened 🍌 then. 🐻🌈 would have been able to buy them all back but at a significant loss which 🐻🌈 get angry about because 🐻🌈 are very fragile inside.

Angry 🐻🌈 decide to shut all the shops where apes can buy 🍌. This stops the apes from opening their 🍌and the belief that they are *actually* gold inside fades away. Meanwhile, 🐻🌈 go to another shop and start buying normal 🍌 which are not definitely not gold inside but look like the mouldy 🍌all the apes want. (This is why the float % is above 100%, because there are fake gold 🍌 in the market.)

Now this gives some time for the 🐻🌈 to be able to buy back the original 🍌 as the belief and price of all the 🍌falls. Some of the chimps sell their potential gold 🍌because they are scared that they might not actually be real gold inside, lowering the price even more.

Meanwhile, king ape [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) is being threatened with ape jail because he made 🐻🌈 angry. King ape has big balls and still believes they are gold inside and doubles the amount of 🍌 he has. Apes go mad and start to buy more 🍌 whether they are gold or not. 🍌are good for apes, even if they are not gold inside.

Whilst 🐻🌈 are trying to find the real gold 🍌that they promised to give back in their first trade they keep promising more and more and more to buy themselves some time. Well the people who regulate the shops we buy 🍌from are started to get pissed of by 🐻🌈 being angry and breaking stuff. So they propose to change the rules so that the 🐻🌈 MUST give back the original 🍌within a much shorter period (previously 21 days, potentially 2 days if upcoming changes pass).

🐻🌈 have many tricks in their fur, they can roar at ape like ' 🍌ARE BAD', 'DONT BUY 🍌', 'WE ALREADY CLOSED (covered) OUR ORIGINAL TRADE'. Well, ape is dumb but no moron, why would 🐻🌈still be angry and shouting if they had fixed their problem? Ape smells bearshit.

A culmination of king big balls [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/), 🐻🌈 getting more angry, many fake ape bots saying 🍌are not good, the regulators of 🍌shop changing the rules, ape president giving money to 80% of apes so they could buy more 🍌, papa Cohen hired into 🍌 growing company, all point towards this not being over and there are still gold 🍌 in the market that the 🐻🌈 really really need.

Apes start to hear rumour that papa Cohen might lead the 🍌 growing company, and that 🍌growing company is about to release its earnings over the Christmas holidays (Remember how all those next gen consoles got sold out), and that 🍌growing company might recall all of those original bananas to hold an ape meeting. If original 🍌 are recalled then 🐻🌈 MUST find them, and will involve them buying many 🍌 to get them to their ape owners.

🐻🌈 Are getting very angry and running out of tactics to make apes let go of 🍌. But guess what? Ape loves 🍌 more than ever. Ape enjoys 🐻🌈being angry, because 🐻🌈 fucked many ape families years ago.

Some smooth brained apes think they could sell their 🍌for a good price now to buy MORE 🍌later. Well what if ape sold some of those gold 🍌? and instead bought mouldy ones later?

If any of these situations arose where 🐻🌈 need to find the original 🍌, then 🐻🌈 is fuk because there are potentially up to 900% more 🍌than when this all started, and ape can demand what ape wants to sell their 🍌 for. Many apes want $1,000,000 for their 🍌, but the longer 🐻🌈take, then ape can ask for more.

**What if 🐻🌈 hasn't got that much money to buy all 🍌for a milli each?**

Well then the shop regulators will sell all of the 🐻🌈 apples and oranges and pears to make sure they have enough for the 🍌.

**What if they still don't have enough money?**

Then those regulators have a money printing machine and ape government has reserves for this.

**TLDR: Ape loves 🍌. 🍌may be gold inside, so ape never letting go of 🍌he already has, only buying more. 🐻🌈 are angry are apes for winning.**

Please correct me if I made some mistakes or could add to my analogy. There are MANY smart apes in this treehouse, and I have learnt a lot from them in only a couple months. Be grateful.

78,m6fhs0,"I’ve been following $UBA and feel it has some solid upside potential if the vaccine continues to be rolled out successfully. It posted quarterly results recently, beating analyst estimates. 


It has a small market cap, under 1 billion USD, and it suffered a massive sell off earlier in 2020 due to Covid-related lockdown.


The dividend cut likely took some shareholders by surprise. Ultimately I believe management will reinstate the dividend once the outlook for the covid pandemic clears. They have hinted at that in their regulatory filings, saying they will likely need to raise their distribution to higher levels. 


The assets are high quality (exposed to suburban New York), and the tenant mix is solid, with significant exposure to pharma and grocery stories.


Also in their [disclosure](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/uba#link_fullReport) they say they will probably hike dividends.
