I only made daytrading with technical analysis and it‘s okay.
Here I learned alot about the fundamentals and how much ... is going on behind the scenes.

So its am complete new world and I invested in GME because of the hard facts based on the great Ressources I found. So This is just my opinion and Not any financial advise:

- shorts are not covered yet, they have to buy every fucking share
- I‘m not in hurry and will hold to the moon
- one million per share is not a meme
- the possible gains are 1000xxxmore than the possible loss, I‘m not dependent on this investment

Just ohne thing must not Happen: the GME goes bankrupt. Then the Shorts would win.
But with the news from Gamestop with new business changes I see a great future for this company.
In my opinion the „analog“ stores will be an enourmus advantage!

And now let the stimulus jump into this Story...

It doesnt matter if I buy at 200, 300, 400 etc. 

I trust 1000% in this stonk after I‘ve read all the DD.

57,m52xtv,"Hindenburg Research – and if you don’t hate them yet, you will soon when they attack one of your holdings.

**Who is Hindenburg Research?**

“Hindenburg Research” is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.

They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.

Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).

Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM, $IDEX, $CODX – to name a few.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where do they get their research?**

This is the million-dollar question.

They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.

In their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.

Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.

That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**

Let’s be clear. This is no Nikola.

Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle. 

Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a “quiet-period” right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.

Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [“thorough” statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will “absolutely” be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.

&amp;#x200B;

**In summary:**

I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.

In addition, I’ll let you be the judge – should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?

What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged. 

I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?** 

A 5-man “research firm” ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious. 

Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn’t close out their short positions get burned this week – and it begins tomorrow.

88,m533s1,"First of all yes, 💎🙌. I will not sell till the squeeze is squozing. Currently I have about $10,000 in GME at an average of $140 a share and it is money that I’m willing to lose but I’d rather not. I’m hoping for my gains to help pay for my college tuition. My question is, when do I actually know when to sell? The other day when it was trending up and got to $350 I didn’t really consider because I knew it was still growing, but when tf do I know that it’s done growing. Like how can I tell that the squeeze happened and it’s peaked and dunzo? I know this is probably really dumb, but as a newer investor I would like some advice. I’m also very welcome to a ton of comments saying I don’t know, just hodl and people saying they don’t know. But if you do have any legitimate advice that would be great if you would share! Thanks in advance fellow 🦍s.",When do I actually sell my GME?,1.0,1615752724,PoggleTheAverage

90,m534ip," Artificial Intelligence (AI) chess gamers and poker players have already proven they could beat human masters. What’s to stop AI from doing the same with financial markets? What happens when AI becomes a portfolio player?

To some extent, it already has, even though investment success relies strongly on human interactions. In fact, very few industries depend on employees’ decisions as much as the financial markets. With AI, are these human decisions being overwritten by machine learning?
