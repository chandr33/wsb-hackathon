32,m72gsb,"This wouldn't affect or prevent the short squeeze from happening, as they still need to exit their short positions, but I think it's theoretically possible they might actually have put so many long call options and purchased a few million shares in the last 6 weeks since they crashed the price on January 28th, that the hedge funds now have a neutral or only a minimally negative impact from the short squeeze occurring, isn't it?

Similar to what Goldman Sachs did to Michael Burry in reality (and played by Christian Bale / Batman in the movie The Big Short), when the hedge funds endlessly delayed his payout of Michael Burry's short position on their mortgage-backed securities (MBS). When Goldman Sachs finally called him and said they can make good on the payment, Michael Burry calls them out, saying (paraphrasing), ""I think what you mean to say is you now have sold enough of your trash mortgage-backed securities and now have a net short position."" (Which would benefit them in that circumstance since the housing mortgage market was about to collapse).

I think it may be possible that the hedge funds have been attempting to do the same so they can survive the nuclear fallout of the short squeeze. The nuke is still going to drop, and their house will still be destroyed by the squeeze, but they fought back the invading army of apes long enough that they have built themselves a fallout shelter below the barn.

I'm kind of autistic so ofc I FOMOd in at the top (first buy at 380 - like a retard) but managed to average down. Man I would've pumped all I had into it but by the time we reached 40.- my buying power was pretty much already gone, taught me a lesson in averaging down at least. Still holding a few shares but not 100% of my portfolio.

It was a fun experience but I wouldn't want to repeat it to be honest - I say that now while throwing  almost everything I have at PLTR.

I may be a fool but 14 billion coins (that will be burned down to 10 billion on the 29th of march) at the price of 0.0017$ each seems like a bargain. Definetly worth a look.

47,m72jt7,"I have no positions in $VIAC, but here is what I will share about what's going on.   


$VIAC is up:

500% over the past 12 months  
143% over the past 3 months  
39% over the past 1 months  
and down 9% on the week....

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, $GME has a short interest of around \~20%. Viacom is at 17% right now, but it was higher in the past few weeks. $VIAC hit a high of $101 but there was virtually no coverage of this stock being shorted, $GME dominates everything, despite $GME dropping from 150% short to 20%, I think the only thing I ever saw on VIAC short interest was over a month ago on CNBC.   


Now you can 💎🤲🏿 whatever the eff you want, but don't let a singular focus prevent you from having massive gains elsewhere.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Viacom still has a pretty large short interest and not everyone has covered:

&amp;#x200B;

Expect the short interest to grow as more ""reports"" like this come out claiming it could see a sharp decline.

Word of advice, I recommend using google chrome; got some weird caching happening in Firefox. If you keep getting cached versions of the scatter plot, use incognito, that 100% refreshes it. 

[https://optionsentiment.live/](https://optionsentiment.live/)

Added the meme stocks to the first page as links for easy navigating, but you can search for any ticker by using the search bar. 

Some explanation of what's there; 

For example, let's take: [https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme](https://optionsentiment.live/option?symbol=gme)

For every ticker, you get a Scatter Plot and a Sankey; Puts are red, calls are green.   


[Easier to see the broad picture in the scatter plot](https://preview.redd.it/p6nkiyi7xkn61.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9112ae3f7002ed42f93f4e795790573df9d50d01)

&amp;#x200B;

[you can hover on the Sankey to get exact number of contracts while also seeing the broad picture](https://preview.redd.it/iiecsdodxkn61.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0246d9d42724b5959ee29193b3357fa930b52c)

Since this is using yahoo finance to get all its numbers from, I had to think of a way to not make a call every time someone wants to look at these. The solution I came up with was to cache each image for 5 mins. 

So if the last snapshot was taken less than 5 minutes ago, you get the cached image. If not, you get a brand-spanking new one and it will replace any existing cached images.

I'm not a web developer by trade, so the site itself is pretty basic. But I can improve it if I can get it to a) pay for its own hosting and b) earn some income on the side to merit working on it.

\--------

First off, hello and kudos for doing what you do. I'm observing Reddit, specifically WSB, for quite some time now. Followed the $GME saga with big interest, and vouching for you since end of February when I caught the actual story behind it. It's absolutely refreshing, and I hope the movie will catch it all.

I did invest a big load into $GME, but got ass-kicked with the recent free fall and lost my earnings from a whole month. Not something to worry about, because I never invest more than I can afford to lose. Still annoying to lose money, especially to hedgies and other people who play unfair.

I'd really like to throw another, actually much bigger load on $GME. Not essentially to make quick gains (for sure this is a factor), but I'm intending to keep at least half of the shares, because I like gaming.

However, I never do the same mistake in life twice. So, before I do it - which I really, REALLY would like to do - I need to understand options, how they work, weather and how they impact price and volume.

I've read a bunch of articles about it, and while Investopedia is a great source and generally provides the best informations, I'm still unable to catch the whole thing. There's always a lot of Jibbering, FOMO and FUD in it. I get that options are complicated and risky, and even professionals have their issues understanding them.

I'm not interested in things like risk factors and ""tips for my well-being"". I'm ONLY interested in the rules, the rest is upon me. I like numbers and facts, and I like when they're covered by good sources.

Please, my little ape friends, give me a good reason to be stupid again on $GME. Please, just provide me the rules, and just the rules.
