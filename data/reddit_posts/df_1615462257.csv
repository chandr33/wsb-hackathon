25,m2oblv,"I was in a dark place in early January. The company where I had been working for the the past 12 years decided to do a “strategic restructure” at the end of last year, and I lost my job right before Christmas. 

On top of that, right around New Year’s I got into a accident. I made a full recovery (at least physically), but, because I lost my health benefits just a couple of weeks prior, I was left with a devastating hospital bill. 

I only had $3000 in my bank account with no new income coming in. I wasn’t sure how much longer I would be able to pay my rent for and faced the very real possibility of having to live out of my car for awhile. I became more and more desperate, so I spent entire days from morning to night spamming my resume to every company I came across on LinkedIn and researching ways to make money quickly. It was during this time that I discovered r/wsb — I’m sure you can see where this is heading. 

FOMO is hell of a drug. With the GameStop hype in full force, I decided to go with the equivalent of a fourth quarter Hail Mary. I set aside $500 for food and in case of emergencies and then threw the remaining $2500 entirely in GameStop stock. I knew I only had a few days before I needed to pay rent for the next month, so the date when I made this do-or-die decision was deeply imprinted into my mind — January 27th. 

I didn’t buy exactly at the top of the peak, but I was close enough to it. I haven’t told anyone this (not even my family), but on February 1st, the day the stock plummeted and closed at $90, I cried for the first time in 20 years. 

By the time the stock bottomed out around $40, there were days when I seriously questioned whether life was worth continuing to live. Joy felt more and more like a distant memory and I started battling with serious bouts of depression, but thankfully there were two things that greatly helped me get through this period. 

The first was the kindness of people around me — my buddy who let me crash on his couch, the owner of a local restaurant who would save leftovers for me so that I didn’t have to make the choice between spending money or going hungry the next day, an ex-colleague who set me up with a job interview. I cannot properly express the level of gratitude that I feel for these people. For them, it might have just been a simple act of generosity, but for me it made a world of difference. 

The second was this community. Even though you are all retards, you convinced me that there was no point to sell at 15% of the price I bought in at. I definitely could have used those $200-300 to help me through those rough times, but you inspired me to hodl throughout the so-short-but-so-long month of February. It was truly Lambo or food stamps, and unfortunately it looked like food stamps were going to win. 

Then it all changed. I started a new job last Monday with a 30% pay increase over what I was getting before. Apparently, the longer you work at a company, the longer they can get away with underpaying you. And then yesterday, even after all the short attacks, it finally happened — the stock closed just above the price I had paid back in January. 

Things are looking up and now that I’m “safe,” have I learned my lesson? Hell no! I want Melvin and Citadel to pay for what they’ve done, not just to me but to all of the people out there whose livelihoods they’ve destroyed and whose dreams they’ve crushed with their shady underhanded tactics. 

They’ve been playing by their own rules for too long, and now that we are finally beating them at their own game, they are shaking in their boots. We have them on the ropes now, boys. Don’t succumb to the FUD now! 

WE AIN’T SELLING UNTIL WE GET TO THE MOON 💎🤲🚀💎🤲🚀💎🤲🚀

Last but certainly not least, if there is anything to take away from my story at all, it should be to never put in more money than you can afford to lose. My story has made a serendipitous turn but it just as likely could have ended a lot differently. YOLO all you want but don’t be idiotic like I was. 

I just like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24sfh26hzdm61.jpg?width=1476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b779b2cce231fb632f3f321a79d4aea3d274a94

&amp;#x200B;

Ticker symbol GTEC.V for Canadian market, for OTC market: GGTTF trading under a 1$ currently.

GTEC Holdings is a licensed cannabis company focusing on premium cannabis based in Canada. What sets this company apart is their approach to quality product, which can be sold for higher prices.

**Company overview**

GTEC is in the process of building out top tier cultivation assets, which when complete, will supply upwards of 10,000 kg of ultra-premium flower annually. High-end market will be undersupplied both in the short and long term, and companies who can consistently deliver quality product, such as GTEC, will command sustained pricing power and strong demand. With GTEC, the key differentiator in achieving these ambitions comes from its experienced management team, state-of-the-art facility design and a strict focus on quality.

# GGTTF PERFORMANCE

To evaluate Gtec Holdings OTC Stock as a possible investment, you need to clearly understand its upside potential, downside risk, and overall **future performance** outlook. You may be satisfied when Gtec Holdings generates a 15% return over the last few months, but what if the market is generating 25% over the same period? In this case, it makes sense to compare GGTTF's stock performance with different **market indexes**, such as the Dow or NASDAQ Composite. These indexes can act as benchmarks that will help you to understand Gtec Holdings stock market performance in a much more refined way. So growth rate is ridiculous!

# Risk and Return

If you would invest  **12.00**  in Gtec Holdings on **March 11, 2021** and sell it today you would **earn a total of**  **67.00**  from holding Gtec Holdings or generate **558.33%** return on investment over **30** days. Gtec Holdings is currently producing 4.3593% returns and takes up 18.1386% volatility of returns over 30 trading days. Put another way, most equities are less risky on the basis of their return distribution than GGTTF, and majority of traded equity instruments are likely to generate higher returns over the next 30 trading days.

Based on monthly moving average Gtec Holdings is performing at about 17% of its full potential. If added to a well diversified portfolio the total return can be enhanced and market risk can be reduced. You can increase risk-adjusted return of **Gtec Holdings** by adding it to a well-diversified portfolio.

Cuz if not then I’m in the wrong place I guess. Lol. Like I can’t even comment any where on here because I don’t have enough karma or whatever that is. I don’t understand it. But it’s stupid. But seriously CPNG starts trading today. Took this from CNBC.


“Coupang is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""CPNG"" later in the day when U.S. markets open.

The company said it had priced 130 million shares at $35 apiece, raising $4.55 billion and valuing the company around $60 billion. That makes Coupang the largest IPO in the U.S. this year and one of the top 25 biggest listings of all time stateside, by deal size.

The price is also above the company's most recent expected range of between $32 and $34 a share.


the valuation and IPO price likely rose because Coupang is the only e-commerce company in South Korea that showed a sizeable gain in market share last year. He said its market size rose from 18.1% in 2019 to about 24.6% last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

The fact is that (Coupang is) becoming the biggest e-commerce business within Korea and 24% market share, I think, it might actually even rise further,"" Yoo said. ""It is possible that they can actually gain as much as 30%+ over the next few years."" That, he explained, would justify why the company's IPO price has increased.”",CPNG IPO starts trading today.,1.0,1615463340,Beginning-Bit-6206

39,m2oe88,"Honestly, this is long af, but it is needed. It could've saved me. So stfu there is no TL;DR learn to read retards. 

I am a longtime lurker and semi-rare commenter on WSB. I had never posted, so I didn't know the process and how truly cancer it is to get past the gates of gaymod. 

Today, after the absolute tank fest attack of GME, I was messaging with my dad letting him know what happened and he said some fire 🔥🔥🔥. I knew instantly that it would give me fat stacks of karma and awards. It was a screenshot of our text message thread. Title was “Even Dad’s are part of the movement. Truest definition of diamond hands. 💎🙌🏾 GME to the mooooon 🚀🚀🚀” cuz i know you retards love rocket ships.

So I posted it. And was like yup here comes my karma...bout to be loaded. But the upvote symbol was greyed out so I was like wtf... So I waited refreshing for like 10 min and nothing. Not one upvote or comment. This can't be bruh this is straight FIRE. So then I was like prob a bug and deleted and reposted. Same thing. Weird. So then I deleted and reposted again. Same thing. Aight... I'm starting to get upset. Quick side note, I had taken adderall for the first time ever that morning so I was hyper-focused.

Then I spent like 20 min scrolling through the meme section sorted by new and seeing how people were posting memes and if they were all actual video memes or if there were pictures too. Most were videos but very few were pics. So it's definitely possible. Then I started getting triggered af. Why tf is mine not showing up?!?! 

So I thought maybe these smooth brains are posting as text and embedding the image to get it to sneak past the gates of gaymod. So I looked up and researched how to do that for like 15 min then figured it out and tried. Immediately deleted by auto mod with a note saying post the actual picture. Fucking fuming at this point. How are all these retards getting their memes through?!!?

Keep in mind... this is all on mobile. I have never browsed or been on reddit desktop version in my life. I post again. Still doesn't work. I open incognito on my computer and go to my post and click it. At the top it says ""this post has been removed by mods blah blah blah"". WTF!!! Why does mobile not tell me this?! All this time of me thinking I'm wildly unpopular and that I don't have fire memes and it was being auto removed by automods and I HAD NO IDEA. What a relief. My post is still fire.

I scroll threw the new meme section again and see a post where someone posted two pics where you can scroll over in the same post and caption them n shit... and was like hmm maybe I can do it that way. So I find a low budget GME moon photo on the internet to put in second pic spot. Post. 🤞🏾

It fucking works!!!

I instantly get 27 likes. 3 comments. INSTANTLY. I'm talking 40 seconds tops. People are raving. Literally on 🚀 to karma moon. I'm going to need to build a trophy case to put all my awards I'm about to get. I knew this shit was fire bruh it wasn't me!!!

But then...right in the middle of my climb to WSB 15 minutes of fame...IT GETS FUCKING REMOVED AGAIN!!! No more comments are allowed and no more upvotes!!!! I get notifications for a few comments (that were funny af by the way, good job you quick little retards) but when I clicked them they disappeared. And my upvote arrow is greyed out again. I'm like WHAT THE FUCK. Literally at this point I am beside myself. 

I go back to my incognito browser to find that same thing -  ""tHiS pOsT hAs bEeN ReMoVed bY mOds blah blah blah"". Omfg.

So I delete...discouraged af. You will find out soon this was a mistake...

I give up for prob like 20 min and do some work but can't stop thinking about what could have been, kinda like if I listened to my boy u/deepfuckingvalue and all inned when we dropped to $40. So then I'm like I haven't tried it on the computer yet.... So I airdrop the screenshot to myself and go to post it from a normal browser - for the first time ever logged in on pc by the way. 

At the top of the page when I click new post in the browser I get this message:

“There is a very high chance that you will be immediately banned for a couple of days by a bot if you don't read the rules on the sidebar before posting a submission. NOTE: If you delete your image-based post because AutoMod caught it you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPOST IT. DO NOT DELETE IT. Contact a mod and ask for an approval.”

Bruh.

I have never been more livid in my life.

WHY TF DOES IT NOT SHOW ME THIS ON MOBILE!!!! NEVER HAVE I EVER EVEN SNIFFED SUCH A MESSAGE BEFORE. 

So then I repost it of course just to see if it flies. Knowing damn well I deleted about 17 posts already at this point. Same thing. Greyed out. Incognito says removed. Unfuckingbelieveable. So then I hyper focus on the “contact a mod and ask for an approval.”

If you made it this far, this is where I can hopefully help out a posting noob like me...

For the life of me I cannot find where tf to find the list of the fucking mods of this fucking stupid ass piece of shit subreddit!!!!!!!!!! Bro I'm so hot at this point I can't see straight. At this point I just have to figure this shit out. I have to win. So I start going to all the pinned threads and just clicking the mod who posted and stickied them and send them a dm saying:

""excuse me, can you please approve my post? I'm not sure why it keeps getting deleted. I've been a member for a long time. (link to post)""

So I send that message to about 5 mods. I'm still clicking around feverishly trying to find a ""contact mods"" through the FAQs and everything and everywhere. Can't fucking find it. This whole process from the first post started at about 1:40 CST. At 2:45ish I took my second Adderall cuz I wasnt feeling the first one I took at 9AM. (so I thought... but looking back on it I was hyper focused on this and not the work I needed to be doing and the second pill was a mistake). According to my time stamps, it is now 3:34PM CST and the second Adderall was starting to kick in.

I waited and waited and kept messaging mods because I had to figure this shit out. I had invested too much. At this point it honestly didn't even fucking matter anymore because my most recent post attempt was now 38 minutes old and it would no longer be new and all the retards would miss it because of the next shiny thing coming by. It was personal.

I keep scrolling and clicking around the sub on pc trying to find something for mods. FUCKING FINALLY I found the section where there is a message mods button. For noobs, this is on the right side of the main page but you have to scroll down far af. If you're looking for it you won't find it. I found it by accident when I got distracted and actually scrolled down the sub to drown my sorrows and failures in memes. 

I click the ""message mods"" button and I write the same message and click send...simmer down for a few minutes awaiting response. Like 3 minutes passed and still nothing so I started freaking out. In my defense it felt like 30 minutes. So I saw when I was stalking the mods that people would comment on their removed posts and tag a mod so I was like oh shit lemme try that. I type the same message in a comment on my post and tag some mods asking them to approve.

Mods Response: ""Sorry, this is too low quality for WSB. It's not particularly interesting or novel.""

............

Bruh... when he responded with that shit I punched so much air to compose myself before my response I look like the Rock now. 

In his defense, he had no idea what I had went through to get to that point. I had touched the mountaintop for 45 seconds, and it was stripped away. I hope this story can help the next autist who finally musters up enough courage to post on the infamous WSB, Thanks for keeping WSB clean and tidy mods, there's a lot of retards in here to wrangle up! 🚀🚀🚀

48,m2ofmv,"**Alright, smooth brains, this has been on my mind for a while and I think I’m finally seeing how this plays out long term.**

So down a shot of hedgie tears and be entertained by my weird thought process. 

For decades the avid retail investor has looked to an authority for trading advice, whether it be the News or a ‘financial advisor’. They took shelter under their DD thinking they knew what they were talking about only to end up in the red or make a 5% gain which they called a win.

But in recent years as social media rose to be king there has been a shift in who investors have deemed the authority. News lost its audience and they started taking sides offering airtime to greedy folk who saw an opportunity to trick investors into thinking they were there for the little guy. \[Be careful of rich celebs who take our sides as they could be playing both sides\]

Why am I bringing this up? Well look around, here we are on a subreddit reading DD by anonymous investors and taking their word over those we can see on the television.

What does that tell me? The avid retail investor has little to no trust the MSM are talking in their best interests. They’ve taken on their authoritarian position and assumed they were the Gods of stocks and could move money better than the hedgies could. How wrong they were.

They’ve come to the realisation they are losing and now out to make an example of those pesky retail investors who ignored their calls to sell but instead bought the dip and/or held. They want them to lose so bad to prove they were just gamblers who are trying to manipulate the market. \[Total bullshit - we like the stock\]

I won’t go into detail here cause we’ve seen it being plastered all over the subreddits. - The MSM lying.

So where am I going with this? 

People today are the new model of stock trading, the behaviours are not the same as boomers. They hold when told to sell \[by the MSM\]. The DD is comprehensive and detailed beyond basic understanding. Reasons are explained and any stock boomer lingo like shorting, buying calls or puts is explained for any simple ape to understand. So not only is the average retail investor learning how the market works at a rapid pace but now knows what signs to look for when they’re looking into a stock. 

GME has taught many how to react when the market is rigged. The talk of Diamond hands has not only been taught but is now in the process of forming how the retail investor behaves in a declining market when the boomers would paper hand and cut their loses. 

We’re entering a new era where retail investors are far more educated, the stock market lingo is broken to simple explanations making it easier for new investors to get up to speed. We find humour in an otherwise boring world filled with green, red and numbers. Not only is the retail market growing but it’ll become the strongest backbone. When red comes there won’t be big sell orders. They’ll simply buy the dip and ride it out. The money made won’t be out of greed, it’s made out of the want for a better more comfortable life. The taxes will \[hopefully\] go towards improving their society and fuel the economy for decades to come.

Change is coming and it’s for the good. 

TLDR: Hedgies and the MSM are going to lose to a bunch of retail investors called apes who can just about read, eat bananas and snort crayons for entertainment and can’t find the sell button.",The world of trading is changing because of you apes. 💎🙌🚀,1.0,1615463530,lukephotoinc

53,m2oha5,"Ticker symbol: $GGTTF trading under a 1$ currently.

GGTTF Holdings is a licensed cannabis company focusing on premium cannabis based in Canada. What sets this company apart is their approach to quality product, which can be sold for higher prices.

**Company overview**

GGTTF is in the process of building out top tier cultivation assets, which when complete, will supply upwards of 10,000 kg of ultra-premium flower annually. High-end market will be undersupplied both in the short and long term, and companies who can consistently deliver quality product, such as GGTTF, will command sustained pricing power and strong demand. With GGTTF, the key differentiator in achieving these ambitions comes from its experienced management team, state-of-the-art facility design and a strict focus on quality.

GGTTF PERFORMANCE

To evaluate $GGTTF Holdings OTC Stock as a possible investment, you need to clearly understand its upside potential, downside risk, and overall **future performance** outlook. You may be satisfied when $GGTTF Holdings generates a 15% return over the last few months, but what if the market is generating 25% over the same period? In this case, it makes sense to compare GGTTF's stock performance with different **market indexes**, such as the Dow or NASDAQ Composite. These indexes can act as benchmarks that will help you to understand Greentec Holdings stock market performance in a much more refined way. So growth rate is ridiculous!

Risk and Return

If you would invest  **12.00**  in $GGTTFHoldings on **March 11, 2021** and sell it today you would **earn a total of**  **67.00**  from holding $GGTTF Holdings or generate **558.33%** return on investment over **30** days. Greentec Holdings is currently producing 4.3593% returns and takes up 18.1386% volatility of returns over 30 trading days. Put another way, most equities are less risky on the basis of their return distribution than $GGTTF, and majority of traded equity instruments are likely to generate higher returns over the next 30 trading days.

Based on monthly moving average GGTTF Holdings is performing at about 17% of its full potential. If added to a well diversified portfolio the total return can be enhanced and market risk can be reduced. You can increase risk-adjusted return of $GGTTF **Holdings** by adding it to a well-diversified portfolio.

54,m2ohpb,"I was in a dark place in early January. The company where I had been working for the past 12 years decided to do a “strategic restructure” at the end of last year, and I lost my job right before Christmas. 

On top of that, right around New Year’s I got into a accident. I made a full recovery (at least physically), but, because I lost my health benefits just a couple of weeks prior, I was left with a devastating hospital bill. 

I only had $3000 in my bank account with no new income coming in. I wasn’t sure how much longer I would be able to pay my rent for and faced the very real possibility of having to live out of my car for awhile. I became more and more desperate, so I spent entire days from morning to night spamming my resume to every company I came across on LinkedIn and researching ways to make money quickly. It was during this time that I discovered this subreddit — I’m sure you can see where this is heading. 

FOMO is hell of a drug. With the GameStop hype in full force, I decided to go with the equivalent of a fourth quarter Hail Mary. I set aside $500 for food and in case of emergencies and then threw the remaining $2500 entirely into the stock. I knew I only had a few days before I needed to pay rent for the next month, so the date when I made this do-or-die decision was deeply imprinted into my mind — January 27th. 

I didn’t buy exactly at the top of the peak, but I was close enough to it. I haven’t told anyone this (not even my family), but on February 1st, the day the stock plummeted and closed at $90, I cried for the first time in 20 years. 

By the time the stock bottomed out around $40, there were days when I seriously questioned whether life was worth continuing to live. Joy felt more and more like a distant memory and I started battling with serious bouts of depression, but thankfully there were two things that greatly helped me get through this period. 

The first was the kindness of people around me — my buddy who let me crash on his couch, the owner of a local restaurant who would save leftovers for me so that I didn’t have to make the choice between spending money or going hungry the next day, an ex-colleague who set me up with a job interview. I cannot properly express the level of gratitude that I feel for these people. For them, it might have just been a simple act of generosity, but for me it made a world of difference. 

The second was this community. Even though you are all retards, you convinced me that there was no point in selling at 15% of the price I bought in at. I definitely could have used those $200-300 to help me through those rough times, but you inspired me to HODL throughout the so-short-but-so-long month of February. It was truly Lambo or food stamps, and unfortunately it looked like food stamps were going to win. 

Then it all changed. I started a new job last Monday with a 30% pay increase over what I was getting before. Apparently, the longer you work at a company, the longer they can get away with underpaying you. And then yesterday, even after all the short attacks, it finally happened — the stock closed just above the price I had paid back in January. 

Things are looking up and now that I’m “safe,” have I learned my lesson? Hell no! I want Melvin and Citadel to pay for what they’ve done, not just to me but to all of the people out there whose livelihoods they’ve destroyed and whose dreams they’ve crushed with their shady underhanded tactics. 

They’ve been playing by their own rules for too long, and now that we are finally beating them at their own game, they are shaking in their boots. We have them on the ropes now, boys. Don’t succumb to the FUD now!

Someone made a shit ton of money from the drop.

Basically most of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying and subsequent MM delta hedging.

Someone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock. They then sold their puts off at the bottom.  The put volume spikes are identical.

This is my own position and not advice of any kind, I'm going to HODL, and flip ATM calls.

[FORBES:](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=73bfa7ae4225)

""I have come to see that there is enormous leverage inherent in two new factors, which are interrelated: 

* the use of call options to drive quasi-forced buying – the “Gamma” formula means that each dollar spent on buying an option can under the right circumstances drive 10 or 20 or 50 dollars of share purchases through the hedging operations of the option-sellers 
* the “swarm” factor – the old market networks operated (legally or otherwise) with perhaps a few dozens of participants; the Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets is said to have **9.4 million members.** If even a fraction of them coordinate their efforts, **they can overrun the market**

This leverage has changed the game. It will be “interesting” to watch as traders probe the market with **this new instrument, to find out what it can really do. I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have.**

\[I have not tried to formally quantify this leverage. But consider an example – with data that is time-stamped at the close of the market on Tuesday, March 9. Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12. The March 9 cost of the option is $24. *If* all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices. 

*Would* they hedge? GME closed March 9 at $246. It was up $118 in the previous 3 days. If it ran another $100 in the following 3 days, each option seller would lose $52 on each option. I suspect they would consider hedging.""",FORBES: (WSB) I’m not sure they even know yet what power they have,1.0,1615464554,DreadViking1

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ford MACH-E (EV SUV) turned out to be a EV hit, the reviews are great and also the sales 
2. The stock is still discounted compared to the sector, it has forward P/E of \~12 vs. \~16 for the sector, for all you apes, the math turns out to be a %33 discount in price
3. Technically the stock looks like it's mooning

PERKS: James Farley (new Ford's CEO since last year) really likes your wife and want to be her BF.

Start a robin hood account and buy a little bit of GME if you have a few bucks to throw at it. Others, hold fast like apes and monkeyfuck the shit out of the hedgies by putting your dough down on GME. Simply stated, nothing like this has happened to so openly defy the ‘market elites’. This is a new level of activism to put it more eloquently.
