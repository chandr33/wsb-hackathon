45,mfzu47," 

There's a ton of DD on these already, so I don't need to say more. I want to analyze this from the position of political science and economics.

Let's start saying that I agree Ocugen is a very risky play because even if the data out there already suggests that it will be a cheap and effective vaccine, covaxin is ENTIRELY depending on getting approval in the US. There are several reasons to be bullish:

1. Biden is relying heavily on technocrats. That's why he doesn't say anything public - he does backdoor deals to try to get policies through, taking the load of Manchin and other centrists. Remember, Biden was in the Senate for decades and was vice-president, that's just him.
2. The technocrats are former Obama folks. Their BIG push right now is the Quad, which is a quasi alliance designed to contain China. South Korea and Japan are the weak legs - they hate each other due to history issues. India is the absolute key to the quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy
3. Covaxin is India's big Pharma play and they will push it with the other quad members if they want India to help balance China.
4. India is also one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines (generics). This is important for Modi's economic development model to get his vaccines in the West. OCGN will be able to produce a lot of vaccine for cheap. The problem is PURELY a bottleneck issue, will the US give authorization? I think yes since the Biden people desperately need India in the quad and Indo (Indian Ocean) Pacific (Pacific Ocean) strategy. Those Biden/Obama folks also have a bone to pick with Trump, and are all in on the science/vaccine train. They see no problem with increasing US supply. They don't give a shit about who makes the vaccine.
5. The US and China just had an AWFUL meeting in Alaska where China was basically talking shit for 13 minutes. US basically said, don't best against us - a threat to China. Of course, we still need phase 3 data. Until that's out, we just got to wait. But ALL of the geopolitics point to obvious reasons why there will be approval.",IS TIME TO BUY OCUGEN?,1.0,1617052699,Marddix

52,mfzvzz,"I've been told that my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maxt80/gme_poker_cannibalism_and_why_the_apes_are_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) was some financial fan-fiction fuckery, so here's something a bit more down to the moon for you apes:

**Why I'm not going to attempt to sell any portion of my GME positions in an effort to cover my initial investment, and why you should fear selling too early far more than selling too late.**

(1) I believe that the long term value of GME, let's say within two to three years, is at least three to five times its current price, e.g. at least $600-$900 per share.  Why?  In short, I believe in Cohen's transformation thesis.  So literally doing nothing but holding until then will be profitable, which is why I'm not planning to sell any portion of my positions just to cover my initial investment.

(2) I believe that while retail almost certainly cannot initiate the squeeze, due to real-time buying volume requirements, retail owns enough shares to effectively determine how high the price goes.  Why? Simple supply &amp; demand dynamics.  The intrinsic value of the shares at this point is not relevant.  All that matters is what retail wants to charge.

(3) I believe that most retail investors are not in this for a small profit, but instead for a life changing amount of money and sending a message to the street.

So if during the squeeze the max price is in retail's hands, how high can the price go?  This now becomes a question of human behavior as opposed to anything strictly financial or technical.  In this context, I believe that the single most important factor is fear.

What does retail fear more?  
(1) Selling too early, or  
(2) Selling too late.

Typically ""dumb money""--that's what the street calls us--fears selling too late, because instead of trying to maximize gains, they want to minimize the downside of what could happen if they wait to close out their positions.  Minimizing losses certainly makes sense if you're on a short term play with a well defined risk to return ratio or when you have a hypothesis that get invalidated; however, when it comes to being long, especially when you decide the fucking price, greed is good.

If you believe in Ryan Cohen and the transformation of Gamestop, you should fear selling too early far more than selling too late.  You will still profit.  Okay, great, but now the fear of selling too late shifts from not covering one's initial investment to the potential opportunity cost of missing the peak, thereby getting less of a return.  No one knows what the peak will be, which is precisely why you should wait and see and sell after the peak.  Patience is key.  Time is your friend.  


**TL;DR**

Any shareholder at this point will make money in the long run, even if they ""miss"" the squeeze, so this is why I'm not going to sell any portion of my positions early on in an attempt to cover my initial investment.

You should fear selling too early instead of selling too late.  No one knows what the peak will be, which is precisely why you should wait and see and sell after the peak.

&amp;#x200B;

**Back on March 5th I posted my potential bullish setup for WKHS**. For the most part, I was dismissed and ignored. It was trading at $12.60, and had been red for nearly 2 full weeks. In the next trading week, **WKHS saw a 43% increase** up to $18. Needless to say, I was able to cash a quick buck off of easy out of the money hedge options.

&amp;#x200B;

WKHS is having another extremely easy, 2 week, bullish setup. Back almost to it's 12.6 price target as before. For the most part, my analysis is driven by financials, technical, fundamentals, unusual option activity, and trends. When I first posted my bullish setup, I didn't go into much detail and I think that's where I lost a lot of people. Today, I will delve into the details of WKHS, the pros and cons, and the potential of **100% INCREASE**

&amp;#x200B;

**Technicals**

For technicals, I wanted to focus on the main technicals that correlate with the ones from last spike-

RSI - 33.98 -OVERSOLD. Back when WKHS hit $12.6 on march 5th, the RSI was at roughly 33-35. Right now, we have WKHS in the same range but with even higher growth potential

MACD (12,16) Crossing over once again at same price target, looking for another potential upswing.

Fast RSI - 10.12, even lower than when it was on March 5th, proving for an even higher strike

Delta/Derivative Bull/Bear oscillator is extremely positive, with Bull/Bear oscillator only a few points away from Bulls taking the lead. This time, delta is even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials and Fundamentals**

&amp;#x200B;

Is this even something to consider? While WKHS saw a huge plummet in sales from 2017 to 2018, we see WKHS is regaining it's momentum. WKHS saw a 250% increase in sales from 2019 to 2020. Don't even get me started on it's EPS spike, going from -.58 to .75 in under a year. While it's DEBT/EQ ratio is not great, it has been steadily decreasing. We have insiders selling because of stop losses and a relatively low insider owning in the first part. Many analysts keep seeing this as a huge downside to the stock, but when insiders own less than 2% of the shares, I don't think this should be something so heavily weighed down on. Despite it's bad DEBT/EQ, its quick ratio is promising and return on equity and assets are extremely high. Bears aren't shorting this stock much, proving to be a reason why bears are afraid of it's long term and short term potential. Fib retracement analysis and trend analysis proves that we are entering a much more bullish setup than before. We are entering a downwards wedge with a standard bull mountain and shoulders.

95,mg0gyv,"Ok so this is some Korean drama level shit but bear with me. So today Morgan Stanley privately sold a 20m share block of RKT, one of the highest short interest tickers. We all know it's probably Bill Hwang's holding, hidden in different entity's holdings through equity swaps. I was surprised to find out that he was able to accumulate such a big position relative to the float and hide it. Who knows what else he was hiding other than the ones already publicly sold off, maybe he also had stakes in GME/AMC. 

Anyways, maybe he was just super cocky and diamond handed all the way to margin call. But what if he had some enemies? He was convicted for insider trading before and probably engaged in all kinds of shady trading tactics. Now if you lost a lot of money to Bill Hwang before and you hear about him leveraging himself 500%, you might decide to go against his positions to bust him. Remember, if Bill Hwang was at such a high leverage, he only have to be down a small fraction of his overall position to be margin called. Maybe the numbers in RKT aren't enough to bust Bill, but perhaps there are several other high interest tickers involved that we haven't found out about yet.

If this is the case, maybe the shorts will ramp down? I'd love to hear other people's thoughts and analysis, or if someone has more information on this.","Theory on Archegos, RKT, and other high SI tickers",1.0,1617054478,CMScientist

In my research into other SPACS I have found that most holding companies run along about 10/share until a big merger then go up to about 25.

Was it that everyone's mind was on other things today like the block trades? Ajax was 4% up today despite all the red in the market.
