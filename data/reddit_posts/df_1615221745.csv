49,m0jyu3,"I believe that Doordash will fall significantly upon the share lockup ending on March 9th (tomorrow). Insiders tomorrow will be able to sell 40% of their shares which represents 29.23% of the total float!

[https://fintel.io/so/us/dash](https://fintel.io/so/us/dash)

&amp;#x200B;

With this many more shares being able to be sold off these insiders are going to dropping their shares like a 🦍 when he finds his rotten 🍌 

&amp;#x200B;

Dash stock is completely overvalued and the insiders know this, as they pushed their IPO to the end of 2020 where all IPO's were getting insane evaluations as shown by the IPO etf: [https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Investing/US-IPO-ETF](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Investing/US-IPO-ETF)

&amp;#x200B;

Many will be trying to lock in as much of the profit as they can, before the IPO bubble pops and shit hits the fan. For a proof of concept, when $PLTR lockup ended, the stock dropped \~32% over the course of 8 trading days. These insiders most of the time just want to lock up their profits and move on to another venture. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I have no thoughts on Doordash long term, I do believe that in the short term with insider share lockup ending this stock will plummet, and then the 📝 🖐 🦍  will panic sell as well making it drop even further.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Doordash price is overvalued and known by inside investors. They will sell off tomorrow when they can drop 40% of their shares.

Spectrum Global Solutions INC (SGSI)

**Spectrum Global Solutions INC (SGSI)**

Another awesome penny stock I came across today that is getting very little attention. These penny stock GEMS are great finds for those who find them early. The more I read about this company the more I’m getting excited for what’s to come. This stock is going places and they are taking their share price up with them. If there's a stock out there where you can put Rockets next to the ticker, this is definitely one of those stocks.

Currently has about 2k watchers on StockTwits. The stock is currently trading at 0.48c and I believe it has the potential to grow substantially from this price. Everyone loves a low float stock because once they get the volume they fly high, and this stock is definitely one of those low float stock and has only 15.4 million shares outstanding.

Spectrum Global Solutions is the holding company for next-generation technology companies specialising in telecommunications across the globe. They currently have 5 holdings and are looking to add another company after announcing a definitive agreement to merge with High Wire Networks. This is huge news! And hardly anyone knows about it. I believe this stock is very under-valued and once it gets the attention it deserves the price of the stock will move quickly.

The merger will be accomplished through an exchange of stock and cash. Spectrum intends to file for a name change to High Wire Networks, as it continues to work towards its goal of up-listing to the NASDAQ, subject to satisfaction of the listing qualifications.

**Revenue**

Their revenue currently is the only downside, however, they have been busy spending money in places that benefit the company’s growth. I suspect this will see much more positivity in the near future especially with the merger of HighWire Networks as Spectrum intends to rebrand itself with the High Wire Network name, and High Wire’s management team will assume a leadership role in the rebranded organization and its subsidiaries.

**Board &amp; Management Team**

**Conclusion**

**Spectrum Global Solutions** is an excellent company with a great subsidiaries portfolio. Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold. Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients. Their potential for growth is limitless. Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float. With volume, this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion. Although their revenue is something that needs improvement, as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved. This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets.

**High Wire Networks** is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2.8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue. The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company. As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business, cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size, thus giving the company a lot of room to grow.

**Final Thoughts**, this company has highlighted that they want to list on the NASDAQ. In order for them to list on the NASDAQ they have to reach a minimum of a $3 bid price. With how strong these companies look, and with the merger, this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal, **with ease**. Therefore, I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0.35 and I believe my PT’s (low: $3, Medium $4.50, High $6) are justified from all of the above mentioned.

Rewind two weeks Ryan Cohen, the new CEO of GameStop, tweeted a picture of an ice cream cone with a frog emoji.

Is it possible that they are in contact? and even co-ordinating their tweets? leading up to some kind of announcement that Keith Gill a.k.a u/deepfuckingvalue a.k.a the Roaring Kitty may join the GameStop board? I don't know, just an idea but anythings possible I guess...
