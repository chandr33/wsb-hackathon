1,m4zw0c,"$GME okay boys and girls, here is an update for tomorrow:

1. Last Thursday &amp; Friday were very healthy consolidation days for us. On wednesday we experienced some volatility, and I'm not even talking about the sudden drop to $170. We rocketed to $348 very quickly which was unsustainable and lead to an inevitable sudden drop. 

If you look at the previous week before that sudden rocket + drop, you'll see that we were steadily gaining from $100 - $250, we want this steady gain, we don't want a sudden rocket UNTIL the hedgefunds are forced to buy back the oversold shares (which will cause an inevitable rocket). 

High volitality and sudden price changes scare people, especially big smart money investor institutes, so we don't want this during the run-up process. 


2. The stability that we have seen last Thursday and Friday is incredibly good news. Remember: if the hedgefunds were dominating this scenario, the share price would be $4. ANYTHING over $4 is a win. A friendly reminder that the price of GME shares was $120 little more than a week ago, and was $40 a little more than two weeks ago. Just hold and keep watching the price increase.


3. The stimulus checks will be a very helpful boost to the health of GME shares, the price may not go up purely because of this stimulus package, but it will definitely help to prevent the price from going down this week.


4. Do not put all your faith in predicted dates. As I am sure you have seen, we have collectively made a move not to promote specific dates. Sure, we are hoping to have big movement *around* Friday March 19th,  but it may be earlier, may be later, may even be a month later - who knows? No one. We can only predict and give as much help as we realistically can. We can not know the future.


5. Hedgefunds who shorted the stock a month ago are STILL in the same shitty position, barely anything has ls changed in that respect. They are trying everything they can to give themselves some time in hopes that we will release the pressure, give up and go home, but what can we do to avoid that from happening? HOLD.

6. And finally, a word of caution. None of this is guaranteed. There are, and will always be, certain factors which are totally out of control, and facts which we can never get confirmed. Welcome to Wallstreet - where lies and cheats get you rich. Do not invest money which you cannot afford to lose. This. Is. Not. Guaranteed.  


And also, just to mention - the closer to Friday 19th, or perhaps Friday 26th, the more volatile this stock will become. Use your best judgement and research and hold for as long as YOU feel comfortable. Don't do it for anyone else, this is your own money that you are investing with. YOU are the only one responsible for it. 

Goodluck to everyone on Monday 15th and remember that every dollar above $4 is a win for us.",Update for Monday...,1.0,1615743872,Krigsgaldr2012

3,m4zwgl,"Yes! If some or most of you didn't know, GameStop also has corporate social responsibility. Look at [this.](https://news.gamestop.com/social-responsibility)

For those lazy apes:

At GameStop, the communities we serve worldwide are the backbone of our business. For this reason, we extend support beyond the four walls of our stores to improve the lives of families of our customers and associates.

It‚Äôs our vision to use gaming and pop culture for ‚ÄúThe Power of Good‚Äù by supporting national and local nonprofit partners that passionately improve youth wellbeing, support military veterans, and promote inclusive and responsible communities through fund raising, ongoing volunteerism and sustainability efforts.

Our global family of brands primarily support the¬†Make-A-Wish Foundation,¬†Children's Miracle Network,¬†Call of Duty Endowment, and the¬†Starlight Foundation¬†in Australia¬†through various in-store donation campaigns and associate volunteerism. Our global team of associates continue to give back in the communities in which we live, work and play, and we also make sure we take care of our own GameStop family through the Gamer Fund Employee Assistance Program.

Power to the Planet Green Initiatives

Beyond our giving power, we also concentrate on reducing our impact to the environment through our Power to the Planet green initiatives. We have a very unique and robust refurbishment and recycling program that results in significant amounts of e-waste being kept out of landfills. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs) and electronic devices and accessories that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish or recycle them. In 2018 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, GameStop refurbished over 5 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 3 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 2.7 million pounds of e-waste that could not be refurbished by cleaning, repairing or reselling the refurbished products in our different retail channels.

In addition to our significant refurbishment and recycling efforts, GameStop has also undertaken and intends to continue to undertake sustainability efforts that will reduce our carbon footprint. Since 2009, we have partnered with Engie Insight (formerly Ecova) to measure our scope 1 and 2 emissions for our domestic videogame stores and our administrative and logistics facilities. In 2017, our total emissions (MT CO2e) were 82,157 and our emissions intensity (MT CO2e by store) was 20.14. From our baseline year of 2009 to 2017, our total emissions dropped approximately 35% and, more importantly, our emissions intensity dropped more than 24%. While some of the total emissions reduction is due to a fluid real estate portfolio, the emissions intensity reduction has been driven by intentional changes in GameStop‚Äôs energy strategy.

We currently have an energy manager that serves as a dedicated resource for our energy management and emissions reduction initiatives and continue to look for ways to further reduce our carbon footprint. Recent initiatives include:

‚Ä¢ Launching a store facing sustainability program, Power to the Planet that has driven significant changes to store consumption behavior and promoted awareness of GameStop‚Äôs sustainability goals;

‚Ä¢ Offering our customers the option of receiving digital rather than paper receipts;

‚Ä¢ Implementing a paper reduction program to reduce unnecessary printing in stores;

‚Ä¢ Retrofitting fluorescent lighting with LEDs in over 2,100 stores, which has reduced energy consumption in those stores by as much as 30%;

‚Ä¢ Instituting a program to purchase Renewable Energy Credits in some markets ‚Äì a program we expect to expand as part of our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint. ¬†


Our expectation is that centralized oversight and administration of our energy management and emissions reduction efforts and our recent green initiatives will yield additional gains in this area. Our progress to date in this area has given us the confidence to explore the possibility of whether, in line with the global shift to a low carbon economy, GameStop could be a carbon neutral company by the mid-century.

2020 Sustainability Metrics

We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2020 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, we refurbished over 2.7 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 2.2 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 0.5 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over our baseline year of 2009, as well as a 20% reduction in year over year carbon emissions achieved through both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. See the Social Responsibility section of our corporate website (http://news.gamestop.com/social-responsibility) for further information on our sustainability efforts. We are not incorporating by reference into this Form 10-K information or materials contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website.

23,m50186,"*DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice, this is just common sense.*

I‚Äôve been having some concerns over the concept that was floating around to short Robinhood on its IPO. And to be frank, I think it to be incredibly dangerous, for these two reasons:

1) Using the same methods as the HFs to siphon away funds will be a disaster for outsiders‚Äô perceptions of this, especially when news agencies get wind of it.

2) You‚Äôve showcased just how powerful your new weapon can be to the financial world. Why give them the opportunity to use that exact weapon on you, with a devastating potential for consequences?

Personally, I think we shouldn‚Äôt be seeing trading apps be listed on the stock exchanges, as that creates a conflict of interest. But the HFs know this too, which means they‚Äôre already likely to want to snap up a good portion of the company. This would immediately put them in a prime position to squeeze any shorters if they so wished. And the last thing you guys need are reports of people trying their hand at small-scale shorting, only to find themselves bankrupted by a massive, more calculated squeeze.

Now you may be asking, why is this an issue right now? I haven‚Äôt seen anyone press this idea lately, hasn‚Äôt it been dead and buried?

My concern is that, starting Monday morning, we might see droves of shill bots trying to drive that narrative into the regular conversation as we approach the IPO. If that happens **DO NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP**. Instead, highlight what messages you suspect are from shill bots, and report them to the mods. Make sure others don‚Äôt fall for it and do your part to steer the discussions somewhere else. Because if I‚Äôm right, it risks jeopardising everything that you‚Äôve worked on.

40,m505x5," Hey everyone,

I recently switched from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade (for the time being, at least). On Robinhood, I was very used to trading iron condors and credit spreads, being part of the theta gang. I told TD Ameritrade that I had extensive experience trading those types of options strategies (around 4 years), and they were my bread and butter.

However, when I applied for that level of options, I was denied and sent back to Level 1: covered calls. With some griping and a massive amount of phone calls, I was pushed up to Level 2: long calls, but not to my original position.

After calling them many times, and waiting an average of an hour and a half for each call, they told me there is nothing I can do since I applied so many times, and better luck next time. I am furious, but grateful that I can at least trade options still.

That being said, long options strategies recently have been tough for me, because I can no longer rely on theta, and the delta trades on many of my options have been going against me. In addition, the odds of long options actually recovering their money back is rare, so I feel like I am just destined to pour my savings in without growing my account.

What can I do to avoid losing my account value? What kind of stats should I look for that can make these trading strategies work under my risk profile? If I had $2,000, where could I switch to where they can give me full options coverage?

47,m507x1,"There have been a good number of other posts about how GME's valuation is not crazy, and this will be much the same - I just want to raise more awareness about this. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I simply have a wife with several boyfriends. 

So, most people think that GME is overvalued because of how quickly it has risen, fallen, and risen again. Today, at this very moment, yes GME is overvalued at this price, but I believe that its current price could go much higher on fundamentals and future growth, and here's why: 

**Price and Market cap:** So, yes, the $250 + price seems super high but I think that's because most people only consider the literal share price and not the market cap. Most new retail trades see this price and think that it's crazy because GME's stock price is higher than AAPL and many other bluechip stocks, but the stock price is not what matters, market cap is. GME's current market cap is about 18B. For comparison, AAPL and AMZN market caps are 2.3 and 1.5 trillion respectively. So for new traders, look at the market cap for valuation, not the actual stock price. Most companies that rise significantly in stock price usually split shares and once GME's price stabilizes, I believe that they will too but that's not what we're talking about right now. 

**Potential**: Before the squeeze, GME's market cap was hovering in the very low billions (between 1-4 billion). Since then, it has obviously exploded because of the crazy short interest and the famous squeeze. However, since then, I believe that GME is becoming a legitimate value play. Ryan Cohen is a fucking genius and he is intent on shifting GME to a gaming e-commerce GIANT. I think that the reason GME is going up so much right now (it's increasingly healthily not parabolically) is because Wallstreet is starting to see it as a value play as well. If GME can capture the gaming market, part of the gambling market, and parts of the e-commerce market (related to gaming), there's no reason why its valuation couldn't increase significantly above what it is today. Again, Ryan Cohen is an absolute genius when it comes to e-commerce, and I think that people are starting to see that he could turn this company around. Let's say that in a few years, he turns GME around and it gets a market cap of $100 billion, which would put the stock at roughly $1500 (assuming no splits happen). This is why I'm saying that a $1000 + price target is not insane by any means. Now, the only way for that to happen in the short term is for more squeeze activity to occur, but I'm talking long term. I truly believe that with the leadership of Ryan Cohen, this stock could move in a similar way to TSLA (sustained, rapid growth over a long period of time) (and I am not saying that it will have the same market cap as TSLA, it won't, I'm saying the way the stock moves could be similar). That's why I don't consider Hodl to be a meme anymore. I think that GME is truly a good long-term hodl because of its imminent transformation, potential markets, and future fundamentals. 

**DFV**: I also want to address DFV. I personally think that when DFV first got into GME he did it for 2 reasons: 1. he saw that it was grossly undervalued (this was before Ryan Cohen) and 2. he saw the disgustingly high short interest and thought there could be a squeeze. Well, he was right on both of those things. Michael Burry also saw similar potential when he invested before the squeeze. As we all know, DFV has consistently increased his position in GME and has hodled through all of the ups and downs. He even doubled down after the senate hearing. Do you really think that someone would put millions of dollars into a stock that just got beat down just to stick it to the senators or to make a joke? NO! DFV truly likes the stock as a value play and sees the long-term potential in GME - he's not just in it for the short squeeze or the memes, otherwise, he would've been out last month and wouldn't have doubled down. 

**Numbers**: I'm guessing many of you are saying to yourselves ""but uncle Hank, my smooth brain can't comprehend GME going up to $100B without some numbers."" Well, here you go retard. First, I just want to say that $100B is an arbitrary number that I'm just using to say it can go multiples higher. 

Here are some big e-commerce stocks: AMZN, SHOP, BABA, WMT, EBAY, PYPL, CHWY. Here are some popular gaming/gambling stocks: ATVI, PENN, DKNG, BYD. So, all of these stocks have market caps in the 10's or 100's of billions. The e-commerce stocks are particularly appealing to GME because that's where Cohen will likely shift GME to. E-commerce continues to grow exponentially and has only increased because of covid. Gaming as its own industry is also rising dramatically with most of the growth being from digital sales. Finally, as everyone knows, gambling is one of the up-and-coming industries that will only continue to grow with increased legalization (especially sports gambling and other online types of gambling). In 2020, US consumers spent over $800B in e-commerce merchants alone. Global e-commerce sales in 2020 were over 4T and are expected to grow over 500B each year. The video game market is estimated to be over 60B in the US and the global gaming market is estimated to be around 150B. Finally, the global online gambling market is estimated to be about 50B and will only rise more with increased legalization. So what does all of this mean? The potential markets that GME can tap into are worth many, many trillions of dollars. Obviously, GME is not going to capture a large portion of these markets, but what this shows is that GME is attempting to go into several industries that already have HUGE markets and are growing fast, and that if GME can get even a fraction of these markets, it will increase its revenue and thus its valuation by multiples. This means that GME is tapping into markets with HUGE potential customer bases and revenue sources. This is not even to mention the fact that GME is already the go-to brick-and-mortar gaming destination (not a very big factor but it obviously helps some). 

**Chewey**: This is my most important point. I believe that Ryan Cohen wants to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce. What did Ryan Cohen do with Chewey? He made Chewey into the go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. Before Chewey, there wasn't a go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. He essentially e-commerceified the pet food industry. I believe that his goal is to do the same with GME and that GME has wayyyyyyy more potential than Chewey. As shown above, gaming, online gambling, and e-commerce are much, much larger markets than pet food. GME is also already an established brand, so Cohen doesn't have to start it from nothing. There is also not an established go-to for gaming e-commerce. So, I believe that Ryan Cohen is going to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce, which is a far bigger industry than pet food, and the fact that he is starting with an already established brand and isn't starting from nothing makes this even bigger.  

**Conclusion:** Yeah bitch I like the stock. $1500 is not a joke. I want to emphasize that the only way for GME to get to $1500 in the short term is with more squeeze activity, which I am obviously rooting for. But long-term, I believe that GME will be well above the current price of $260ish. Do I still think the squeeze will happen and do I want it to happen? You bet (check my post history for proof). Though I am rooting for another squeeze, however, I also see the long-term potential in GME as a value investment as I think DFV and many others now do as well.

So I am celebrating $1.3M in gains with three cups of morning coffees instead of my usual two. I felt a lot of rules we set on ourselves limit returns we can get. The strategies I use for this account would be shitted on by investment professionals and most people lurking on value investing forums. This account was dedicated for fun trading using strategies that I don't implement on the other accounts I manage. I have been sharing my DDs here with the community.

Background information on the company:

Tui is a German travel agency. In fact, they're the largest travel agency in the world, with 27 million customers, 48000 employees and ten billion dollars of revenue in 2020. They have 350 hotels, 18 cruise ships and 150 airplanes.

Their business model is mostly operating as a travel agency, that operates either through their website or physical locations, although they earn higher revenues by owning some of the airlines they use, as well as hotels or cruise ships.

Since 2012 the Tui stock has been on a fairly consecutive rallye, breaking out and shortly spiking at over 20‚Ç¨ (24$) in the summer of 2018, before correcting down, settling around 8‚Ç¨ (9.5$) and rising back to 12‚Ç¨ (14.5$) shortly before the covid outbreak in early 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

As i stated, after this it rose to 12‚Ç¨ before dropping hard to slightly below 3‚Ç¨, where it spiked and fell a couple times, with a hard ceiling at 6.40‚Ç¨ (7.70$) and a floor of 2.90‚Ç¨. (3.5$)

&amp;#x200B;

[Clear floor during covid at slightly below 3‚Ç¨, or 3.60$](https://preview.redd.it/65pzfc3g21n61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c438ba12915dbae401302fb51b8db5641403814d)

&amp;#x200B;

# BEAR CASE:

Currently the stock is trading for 5‚Ç¨, which is a strong increase since its 2.90‚Ç¨ floor only a couple of months ago, and you need to ask yourself why? They had over 72.000 employees in 2019 but had to fire one third of them in the pandemic. Because of their low profit margin they are currently bleeding cash. They were the first company in Germany to ask for government aid, and the CEO said that the only other alternative was bankruptcy. Up until recently they had many airplanes in their Tuifly group that were not allowed to fly, and they lost a billion dollars in 2020. Germans are also only 10% vaccinated, so why is the stock up 40% in a month?

# BULL CASE:

The stock dropped hard from 20‚Ç¨ because their airline Tuifly ordered new airplanes. A bunch of 737 max's. As many of you might remember, a little more than two years ago, Boeings 737 max line experienced two tragic accidents, with them being grounded indefinitely. Recently (and i mean as little as two days ago ""recent"") airlines have been picking the plane back up and it is now flying again all over the US and Europe. 

Tui experienced a record breaking billion dollar loss in 2020, yet did not go bankrupt because of government support. This is the weak part of this analysis, but I do not think that *during* the vaccination procedures the government would let a travel agency go bankrupt, after having helped them once already. In early 2020 they had 1.4b in cash reserves, and many analysts are saying they are over the risk of being bankrupted by this pandemic.

Late 2019 Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy. One of their biggest competitors, which was a large component of why the stock sharply rose right after the 737's were grounded. I have little doubt, that without the pandemic, Tui would have grabbed a big portion of that market share, and now that the 737's can fly again, I don't see why Tui would not be able to be at least near their all time high. Of course we DO have a pandemic, and the company won't just bounce back to 20‚Ç¨, but if it does not go bankrupt.... how long do you think it will stay under 10‚Ç¨ when everyone starts making up for lost vacations, and they're by far the biggest travel agency?

**More speculative:** Many Germans are saving up for a vacation, because they couldn't go for so many months now. It will obviously be a long time before they feel safe with travelling to other countries and other continents again, so once the borders open again many will feel compelled to book pre-planned travels with existing and proven pandemic measures. Now who happens to be the biggest company supplying these? Right. Tui. It also just so happens that if i google ""reise buchen"" (book vacation) the first two generic search results are, conveniently, Tui.

&amp;#x200B;

# MY CONCLUSION:

I for one am very bullish on Tui as a long-term investment, and I think it would not be a bad idea to just buy shares now, but I'm a greedy fuck who wants those $$$, so here's my takeaway from this.

Germany is really slow with vaccinations. Like most of Europe, really slow. Look at this chart:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvlhbtse61n61.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c71c0aefcb040b4202c15777b29a4ccda4ce15

I don't know how Israel has 106% of its population vaccinated, but Germany is sitting below the European average at 10%, and our curve really does not look all that exponential. 

In my opinion the stock is currently moving up because people think the pandemic slows down over the summer and we will all be vaccinated by fall. I think they are forgetting about how slow we do business here in Germany! I'm personally going to wait until the inevitable happens and people realize that travel restrictions aren't even lifted in many parts INSIDE of the country, and that it will be a few months before enough people are vaccinated to actually travel to other countries. Tui made crazy rallys many times this year, for this exact reason, and it always dropped hard to between 2.9‚Ç¨ and 3.5‚Ç¨.

Which is why i'm thinking about investing half of my money into shares if/when it reaches 3.75‚Ç¨ again, and the other half into knockout call options with a knockout price of 2.80‚Ç¨, because I believe the floor is set, unless there is a mutated covid coming, in which case i have bigger worries than Tui. :)

&amp;#x200B;

And just in case some of you thought i'm not retarded enough for this; Last week i bought a knockout put option on Tui so i can ride this stock down, and then buy call options and hodl it on the way up when vaccinations are a little further on their way.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you say? Have I missed something in my assessment? I'd be happy about nothing more than someone to finally tell me why this is a dumb idea, or why 5‚Ç¨ is the actual current floor and i should get in now. I'm content with my analysis, but now i need your input. :)",DD: Tui and its future potential. Please prove me wrong.,1.0,1615745165,vlosh

Day everyday he breathes in the apocalypse
The doomed future, 
Caused by his parents, their lips
Are sealed, no apology, 
Just keep calm and carry on son,

Well, he defies this logic
The end is near,
That's written in stone
But he cannot read
So he keeps on and on

The journey to Mars,
Because this is the way.

The Gamestop launch starts
To begin the great raid,

The sound of the barchart breakaways soars
He buys, he holds, the fellow ape nods

And now he became

To press sell,
That what says everyone who wishes 
Him well

To listen to one's smooth brain
Or to be more

To be a millionth piece of a timechanging glory.

His hands, they're diamonds taking shape
He says he's not more than a simple ape

But who he is then, who saves his own fam,
In African forests through international funds
Who is no racist, no sexist, just bold
And naive to believe 
He can be a story that's told

How he stuck it those
Who, in a slow steady dose
Make the poor poorer
The money machine, the market ruler,
The Melvin analysts in ivory tower,
Fundamentalists, too drunk with their own power.
