But you are not allowed to talk about it in this community because SOS does not have over $1 billion market cap. Of course it did before Hindenburg and Culper hedgies published fake report calling it a scam, not having any rigs with multiple fake investigation law firms they colluded with. But after SOS provided video evidence, they admitted that SOS is real and mining is real but the company is Chinese hence it is still a shady company. Yes, hedgies made millions with fake lies over the weeks causing retail investors to lose millions and the market cap to drop under $1 billion but it still doesn't matter.

It will also crash the market.  Which means new laws to restrict retail trading.
