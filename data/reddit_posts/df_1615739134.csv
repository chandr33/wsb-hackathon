If you have made a charitable donation because of this sub to any organisation no matter how small,
DM me a receipt or screenshot or just general proof of how much you donated and I'll start putting together totals in this post and keeping track of the organisations your donations have helped across the world.

We are nearly ten million apes strong together and we have an opportunity to really help some causes and be the REAL robin hood. Take tendies from the rich and give to those in need.

45,m4yhun,"There are a lot of numbers thrown about these days. To help me get a better grasp at what a difference selling at 1 000 or hodling til serious numbers makes, I made a little spreadsheet. To not get blinded by the big numbers, I also converted the results to a monthly payout over 30 years, basically to help me understand what impact it would have on my need to earn an income. Maybe it is of use for others in getting mental strength to not sell at 1 000.

You enter the number of shares you hold, and the average price you paid for each. It fetches the current shareprice. It gives the option to sell a number of shares to recup your initial investment, thus giving you peace of mind for the further battles. Or YOLO all the way (i.e. enter 0), you decide.

There are two strategies I accounted for: Selling in stages or selling all your shares at once.

It will calculate the total gain for you, and also how much that would mean per month over a 30 year period. For me it made it very clear why there isn't really a point in selling at 1 000, if there is only the remotest chance of it going to much higher figures. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and hopefully this spreadsheet can add to our arsenal of anthropoid defense weaponery.

I have to talk about $CPNG (Coupang aka ""Amazon of Korea"" aka ""Chef Pang"" aka ""C Piddy"") because y'all need to put some respect on its name. It's one of the largest tech companies to IPO on the NYSE ever ($55B) and the largest tech IPO in South Korean history. This isn't just some company. It's THE company.

Some of its notable backers are Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Frankel.

Before trying to understand Coupang, you have to understand South Korea as a country.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APE MUST READ

South Korea is a first-world country with the 11th largest economy (i.e., GDP) in the world. That makes them bigger than Russia, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Poland, Taiwan, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand, Argentina, Nigeria, Iran... you get the point [https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp)

They also have the 7th largest e-commerce market in the world. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

It is also the ultimate turnaround story. Up until the mid-1900s, they were a third-world Japanese colony, but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world. And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment. Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, LG, KPop... (KPop is an international sensation right now - $564M export reported Aug 2020 last year and growing). [https://www.statista.com/topics/5098/music-industry-in-south-korea/#:\~:text=All%20in%20all%2C%20the%20South,to%20become%20a%20global%20phenomenon](https://www.statista.com/topics/5098/music-industry-in-south-korea/#:~:text=All%20in%20all%2C%20the%20South,to%20become%20a%20global%20phenomenon).

Also, just know how advanced they are technologically. They have had RFID chips a decade before us. They've had 5G for years. They have the best e-sports gamers in the world. They are no stranger to the worldwide web.

A big reason why they are so successful is because they are 2nd in the world in how much of their national GDP they spend on R&amp;D. [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01466-7#:\~:text=The%20high%20R%26D%20intensity%20that,of%20nation%20building%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20Tim](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01466-7#:~:text=The%20high%20R%26D%20intensity%20that,of%20nation%20building%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20Tim)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GETTING BACK TO COUPANG

$CPNG is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70% of South Korea's population (36 million / 51 million) within 7 miles of their distribution centers. They can only do this because 50% of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area. Yes, 50 fucking percent. 25 million people. That's like 3 New York Cities side-by-side. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul\_Capital\_Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Capital_Area)

South Korea's annual online sales is $37 billion and e-commerce sales of total retail sales 9.8%. [https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/](https://www.business.com/articles/10-of-the-largest-ecommerce-markets-in-the-world-b/)

$CPNG sales went from $6B in 2019 to $12B in 2020 (92% growth) [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/11/korean-e-commerce-giant-coupang-skyrockets-on-ipo/)

They also increased their market share from 18% in 2019 to 24% in 2020 (33% growth) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html)

.

.

.

So, if the South Korean e-commerce market grows at a 22.4%, it will be $142B by 2024. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/coupang-ipo-strategist-says-investors-should-consider-profit-outlook.html)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISKS &amp; REBUTTALS

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They sell mostly their own products - OK they've got strong customer loyalty. Can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future? Potential is there.

Low gross profit margin - Retail has always historically been a low profit margin business. Is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service? Absolutely.

Still cash flow negative - Did you see the revenue growth? $6B to $12B in one year. They're a growth company in its early stages. I also mentioned above how they're investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure (distribution centers within 7 miles of 70% of population).

They don't have AWS - It's not a literal copy of Amazon. They are also growing their e-commerce business before focusing on anything else. Sales went from $6B to $12B in one year. They need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else. It's highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years. Their founder is a Harvard drop out.

They dominate only in South Korea - What's wrong with that? Even with the South Korean e-commerce market alone, $CPNG can become a $500B company. They are focused on dominating their immediate market. I'm sure they'll create new services and create new sources of revenue. Once the Korean market is saturated, they'll figure out a way to expand. These South Koreans are smart and good at tech. Don't underestimate them.

VALUATION - PRICE TARGET

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If in 2024, $CPNG has a 40% market share, they will have $57B in sales (Amazon has 37% market share of US in 2020). With a conservative P/S of 4, that puts $CPNG FAIR VALUE at $133 PER SHARE ($57B sales x 4 = $228B valuation). If they are doing well and they have hype, with a P/S of 6 (BABA has 6, CPANG has 7), then $CPNG should be $200 PER SHARE ($57B x 6 = $342B valuation).

And this is if they DON'T CREATE ANY NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Think about that. No new products or services. Just purely their e-commerce business and it's still going to be worth $150-200 PER SHARE. If they launch an AWS-like thing or maybe another service that's just waiting to be discovered, they're going to do an additional $10B easy with the market share they have so add another $50 to the price targets.

As one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world, $CPNG is not here to stay. It's here. To takeover (South Korea).

CONCLUSION

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin products/services, but this is a bet I am willing to make (Harvard drop out, Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, etc.). I guarantee they will innovate.

Oh and even if it's not them developing something internally, they can always acquire a company. They're going to do billions in profits soon. That is a lot of money.
