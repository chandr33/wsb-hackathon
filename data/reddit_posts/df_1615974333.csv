1,m6wr8i,"I have read some crazy theories on this forum throughout the recent GME chaos and I fucking love it tbh. I never really used Reddit in the last (fucking dumb move on my part obviously) but my god this it is fun to read and lurk on. You are some wild fucks and I dig it. That being said, I figured I would be a complete leach if I didn‚Äôt at least try to add some of my crazy (as a hopeful thank you) just in case it actually works out as I see it in my Autistic Ape-like brain so here it is....

For quite a while now, like most of you fuckin losers, I‚Äôve found myself quite isolated and bored throughout the pandemic and tbh even before it and I went down the YouTube doc/lecture/random talks rabbit hole and from what I‚Äôve learned I legit think that this whole GME/AMC/BB/NOK game that we are all fucking around with may be just one small piece to a plan to break the stifling beaurocratic* processes throughout the established/outdated system that true innovators have struggled with for centuries.

Again, this is stretch fucking crazy BUT with the way the FED is printing money and playing with the bond yields throughout this extremely volatile stonk trading while also basically neglecting its implications makes me think that it is exactly what they want to happen (hopefully). IMHO the world is fucked in so many ways rn and our most effective tool to fix the problems we face is based in science and innovative technologies that complement each other in an exponential fashion (AI/Machine Learning).

I truly believe that the Meme stonk revolution was orchestrated by a benevolent group of people that saw how broken our current market system is and found an opportunity to destroy it and replace it with a system more aligned with being one of those complementing innovative technologies to be used for an overall improvement of current outdated systems and the world. 

Either I am way late to this idea and all of you guys are going to call me a newb (fair) or hopefully this note helps us move towards that direction even faster but either way I fuck with you idiots. Thanks for allowing me to lurk. 

Lastly, if these stonks do end up tearing down the current economic system I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad move to cop some more technologically advanced forms of payment with all those fuckin GAINZZZZZZ, just in case you Apes really do fuck everything up.

In  2008 Wall Street and companies  such as Goldman Sachs started betting  against the sub prime based  derivatives that they were selling to  unsuspecting companies like AIG

US   taxpayers had to bail out AIG to the tune of 150 billion so they could   pay back Goldman Sachs 15 billion because the government forced AIG to   pay back the Goldman short position at 100%

Henry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman, was US Treasury Secretary at the time.

Goldman recommended AIG buy the mortgage based derivatives marked with A ratings even though they knew they were shit

And when people protested the billions we were paying to bail out the banks and AIG, here was their response.

Astra Zeneca was the third company after moderna and pfizer to get an approved Covid vaccine to market and have allready vaccinated millions of people, great right? 

Only problem is that for some reason in the last week or so there have been a number of cases in Europe of healthy people developing deadly blood cloth‚Äôs (there have been several deaths) only thing they have in common is that they reccieved the Astra Zeneca vaccine... several european countrys have now stopped all vaccination using Azn for the time beeing. 

On top of this Azn are having huge delivery troubles while pfiezer, moderna and new boy J&amp;J are upping their forcasts.

Ive been told by so many and have seen the success of many that invest their money into brokerage accounts like charles schwab, vanguard, and fideltiy etc, and its guaranteed to earn some small passive income even when the market fluctuates.

so my question is:

1. how should i invest? which brokerage should i use?
2. how much should i invest?
3. how much can i make per month?
4. what are some precautions i should take?

Weed isn‚Äôt going anywhere, the political tide is turning in the US, and the weed money is running a slight lag behind the GME/AMC spikes.

ZYNE has seen outsized increases in the recent activity in the market ‚Äì jumps of up to 49% on March 15, and 51% Feb 10. Their MA have all turned bullish with the exception of 10D due to its recent peak. The long term averages are all showing buy.

The only weed stock which has performed similarly is TLRY, but there is some [ongoing legal activity](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/26/2006653/0/en/SHAREHOLDER-ALERT-Pomerantz-Law-Firm-Reminds-Shareholders-with-Losses-on-their-Investment-in-Tilray-Inc-of-Class-Action-Lawsuit-and-Upcoming-Deadline-TLRY.html) re their merger documents with APHA. I'm too dumb to know what that's about but it makes my bumhole pucker.

Further, if the merger went ahead one APHA share is worth 0.83 TLRY shares post merger. If you were to take the view that these legal issues are not an issue at all, APHA is still the better option. Current price APHA $20.22 equals 75% of TLRY at $26.97 making it of higher value post-merger.

&amp;#x200B;

**The business** 

ZYNE specialize in neuropsychiatric conditions, and at [least 91% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/)  think cannabis should be legal for medical reasons at least. This positions ZYNE to take advantage of the broadest spectrum of the population with respect to public acceptability. ZYNE uses a transdermal gel, ensuring more bioavailability and avoids any potential issues with the likes of an upset stomach.

**Downsides:** Non psychoactive, so you‚Äôll need to go elsewhere next time you‚Äôre having a night in playing Forknife with your wife's boyfriend.

**Political climate**

In total [five](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/cannabis-hemp/1046534/marijuana-legalization-update-early-2021-legislative-developments) states voted for progressive cannabis legislation in 2020

While the golden ticket is full federal legalization, it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight. The first big jump will come from the incoming [SAFE Act](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthoban/2021/03/15/democratic-senators-elevate-federal-cannabis-reform-to-high-priority/?sh=4a12c80b7ba9)  which will allow the cannabis sector access to the banking system. Alas apologies to the ex marines who may not have the job carrying [bags of cash](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/710076855/bags-of-cash-armed-guards-and-wary-banks-the-edgy-life-of-a-cannabis-company-cfo)  but ease of **doing business** makes a better business.

Internationally [Mexico](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/mexico-marijuana-legalization/) [New Zealand](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/most-new-zealanders-support-decriminalising-cannabis-poll-claims/YNVVZONSBTZFM7N6HBEBF2W4ZM/)  and [Europe](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-cannabis-testing-market-expected-135000684.html) are softening their stances on cannabis also

56,m6xeco,"SO I was reading fidelity news this morning and came across this :

Mar. 16‚ÄîReddit's guerrillas have come to the aid of gorillas, and that's been  a very good surprise for a small nonprofit based in Atlanta. Since Saturday, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, dedicated to  protecting gorillas, has received a groundswell of donations from an unlikely  source: investors on a Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, better known in national  news for boosting the stock price of GameStop(GME). They donated more than $330,000 to the Georgia nonprofit as of Tuesday  morning, with the tally still growing. ""We were surprised, thrilled and appreciative when we first heard that the  WallStreetBets community was investing in our work,"" Tara  Stoinski, the organization's chief executive and chief scientific  officer, wrote in an email to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""This  is a huge deal to our organization."" WallStreetBets became a central forum for investors taking on hedge funds  that had bet against video game retailer GameStop(GME) and other companies by shorting their  stock.

SO I was reading fidelity news this morning and came across this :

Mar. 16‚ÄîReddit's guerrillas have come to the aid of gorillas, and that's been a very good surprise for a small nonprofit based in Atlanta. Since Saturday, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, dedicated to protecting gorillas, has received a groundswell of donations from an unlikely source: investors on a Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, better known in national news for boosting the stock price of GameStop(GME). They donated more than $330,000 to the Georgia nonprofit as of Tuesday morning, with the tally still growing. ""We were surprised, thrilled and appreciative when we first heard that the WallStreetBets community was investing in our work,"" Tara Stoinski, the organization's chief executive and chief scientific officer, wrote in an email to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""This is a huge deal to our organization."" WallStreetBets became a central forum for investors taking on hedge funds that had bet against video game retailer GameStop(GME) and other companies by shorting their stock. The Reddit movement helped put GameStop's(GME) share price on a rollercoaster, with stunning peaks and sharp falls.

Hello, fellow apes,

This isn‚Äôt financial advice, I‚Äôm a dumb ape yada yada yada.

This isn‚Äôt DD either‚Ä¶

My hope with this post is to try and make the world a better place, for people that are either involved in the MOASS or not.

The world has been a dark place for a while, the gap between the rich and the working class has been getting bigger and bigger by the day, you don‚Äôt need to be a normal human with a wrinkly brain to see that.

The squeeze is pretty much inevitable at this point, provided we all buy and hold the stock. A lot of people stand to make a lot of money on this and I‚Äôm sure some of us, even if it is a small percentage, will turn into rich assholes. It's human nature given the number of people involved in this.

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of good things on this sub as of recently, #ApesAdoptingApes, and numerous other charitable donations. This is proving that money is going into the right hands, and that‚Äôs what the world needs.

When this squeezes and millions/billions are made, support charities, support local businesses, support start-ups that you believe in. Invest in businesses that you think can make a difference to the world *on top of what you think would make you some extra bananas.* üçåüçåüçå

I genuinely think that this could be a turning point for the economy as a whole. And the general ethics of people with the capital to make a difference. The 1% has been known to be trash for a while and pretty much all I‚Äôm saying is #BeABetterOnePercent.

Love you guys,

Take care, stay healthy, buy and hold

86,m6xta4,"For those of you who have been living under a rock, short sellers have been trying to push GME into the ground.  In late January during stage 1 of the squeeze, the hedgies raided a certain ETF, which lost 80% of its assets as outflows to the shorts that just wanted the GME shares tied up in ETF units.  This gave the hedgies enough GME to cover their positions without using up all the float and exacerbating the squeeze.  But as we all know by now, the story didn't end there.

Hedge funds that still have a lot on the line have continued to short GME, doubling down in desperation to keep the price low, to avoid margin calls, gamma squeeze, and ultimately the Mother of All Short Squeezes.  While trying to short every possible source of GME, the hedge funds continued shorting ETFs, that one ETF in particular, with every unit in the float shorted multiple times over.  One of the things we've been hoping for is that our special ETF is going to recall the units it loaned to short sellers before it rebalances this Friday.

You see, our special ETF is supposed to be evenly distributed among many different stocks.  But with the recent rise in GME's price, GME is now overrepresented.  When the ETF rebalances on Friday, it is going to sell most of its GME and buy more of everything else.  As far as I can tell, two things can happen:

1. The ETF does not recall its loaned units.  ETF sells GME, GME's price goes down.  Shorts close their positions using newly rebalanced ETF units that contain only a fraction of the GME they once held.
2. The ETF does recall its loaned units.  Shorts are forced to scramble for GME to reconstitute the ETF units they sold, starting a short squeeze, pushing all of our calls ITM, triggering a gamma squeeze, and the MOASS.  The ETF can then sell the GME itself, getting a much better price for it, and therefore it is able to buy more of the other stocks it holds.

I know what I want the ETF to do, but I wonder if the ETF has other motivations.  Also, I have no money and I don't know anything at all about the stock market, so maybe the two possibilities I listed above make no more sense than an ape grunting, and I'm just embarrassing myself.  Either way, I'd really like to hear what you think is going to happen ahead of the rebalancing on Friday.",Will the ETFs that contain GME recall units loaned to short sellers before rebalancing?,1.0,1615978634,NathanielA
