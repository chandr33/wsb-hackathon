2,menj6o,"I now own 200 shares, BUT my cash balance is NEGATIVE $2400+.

I was real dumb and didn't even check my TD this entire week until this morning. So yes, even though I made $143 profit on 200 Ford stock, I owe TD $2400.

In a good scenario, if I got $2400 lying around elsewhere, I'd just deposit on Monday and problem solved. Thing is I don't and I do want to sell all 200 shares this upcoming Monday, but I can't, since my cash balance (buying power) is negative $2400.

So what should I do? I can't sell any of my other holdings since it costs $9.99, and the shit thing is, I can't make any moves since due to my dumbass mistake, I can't even sell.","So I need some help. My Ford calls were ITM yesterday, and got assigned.",1.0,1616881763,Becksploder

28,meo2v0,"Hi all dear brothers, sisters and dear friends. I'm a lurker since January 2021. I have never purchased stock or shares in my entire life. I finally worked hard, made the decision and was able to afford a humble double digit amount which I have been holding through the entire ride of green and red. Humanity has suffered far too much, and is suffering right now. The world's rich can end hunger in about 1 hour if they all spared 1% of their wealth collectively and at least fed  clothed and sheltered the poor. But wealth is a trial for Mankind, and money does indeed corrupt the soul. All Saints of all Faiths chose poverty over wealth, to become closer to God and live a pure, simple and spiritual life of peace.

I work 7 days a week. Around 65+ hours. I provide for my kids, my Wife, my Parents and help some people I know. I am the sole earner. I have never desired wealth or riches, my wealth is my Belief, my Prayers and my contentment of the soul.

THE PLAN.

I will HODL until any reasonable figure between 1 Million and 10 Million, or otherwise I will never sell. But can I afford to lose my money? OH YES. This is bigger than money, this is about principle, about the unfair wretched gap between the truly poor and destitute and the overly ungrateful rich. If it does not squeeze anywhere near those figures, I will happily HODL for years, or the rest of my life. If I sell for between those numbers stated, here is my actual plan:

I will adopt Orphans, not 1, but many, and give them the best love, care and life they could ever have dreamt of. I will raise them as my own blood children until they are married and become self sustaining Adults.

I will give huge amounts to trustworthy Charities, for the broken, poor and needy, affected by disaster and war, help pay for Water Wells, Eyesight operations, donate money to help the poor make an earning and livelihood out of some form of work or trade. I will go on holidays to very poor areas and give mysterious packages of money to poor people living in tents, shacks, poor dwellings and ask for their Prayers as they cry in gratefulness. What does God love about the poor? They have nothing, yet they are the most generous. If you have not eaten, they will break their bread and give you the larger piece. If you go to their tent, they will put something in front of you on the table. This is Humanity, this is that true Faith means and teaches.

This is the only Community I have ever come across, where colour, race, religion, background, and any single difference whatsoever has no relevance, except our common goodwill. Each post I see of generous Apes donating to Children's Hospitals brings tears to my eyes. Our dear sister who worked so hard and bought 1 share with 3 months Salary for the cause brought tears to my eyes.

This is not a temporary phenomenon or awakening. This is a permanent family. We will continue to become ONE group of love, common goodwill, respect, manners, care and generosity well after any squeeze which will eventually squoze. This is why the billionaire rich cannot understand our resolve. This is why all their algorithms could not calculate our Diamond Hands.

My love, heart and care goes for you all, I am praying for the benefit of each and every one of you, but promise me one thing - DO NOT BECOME greedy, arrogant and boastful with your newly given wealth. Stay real, stay humble and stay GENEROUS. Help those in need and make a change in this World, because your life is only temporary, and the opportunity to do good is also a small window that is temporary. I will look for my Ape brothers and sisters in the Craters of the Moon, God bless.","This is an event like no other. We are a family and unity like no other.

Would the best way to beat these hedge funds and get closer to the squeaze is to double up when they short the price below your average? Only if you can afford it of course! Stop fighting them to push the price up when they are short laddering us!!

Think about it!! We own close to 90% of the float!!  If we keep  buying up the float every time they short the price down we would put more pressure on them for the squeeze!! 

Basically we are using their ladder attacks to better our positions and buying up more of the float to pressure the squeeze!! Thoughts??",Feedback!!,1.0,1616884388,DavidPrest2021

Important Account UpdateFrom:investornotification@isecurus.com

Date:Saturday, March 27, 2021, 02:02 PM PDT

📷

Dear ,

Apex Clearing Corporation (""Apex"") is notifying you about an upcoming amendment to the Apex Fully Paid Securities Lending Program (the ""Program"") in which you are currently enrolled. Pursuant to guidance published by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Apex is changing the method by which it maintains collateral in the program. Collateral for the fully-paid securities that you lend Apex will now be maintained in a custody account at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

By continuing your participation in the Program, you hereby agree to the amendments to Master Securities Lending Agreement between you and Apex. The updated Master Securities Lending Agreement and the Terms and Conditions to the Program are available for you to review [here ](https://www.apexclearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Apex-FPSL-MSLA-2021.pdf)and will become effective as of April 22, 2021 (""Change Date""). Your account statement will continue to reflect any income you may receive from participating in the Program in the same manner to which you are accustomed. 

The Program changes will occur automatically and the way you interact with your account is not changing. If you no longer wish to participate in the Program, you must notify your broker prior to the Change Date in writing.

Sincerely,  
Apex Clearing Corporation

**Frequently asked questions regarding this change:**   
**What does this mean for my investment account?**

Due to recent regulatory guidance, all broker-dealers who offer Fully Paid Securities Lending are making updates as needed to ensure compliance with the guidance. Accordingly, Apex will be changing how collateral is held when your securities are borrowed to better protect your interests. The way you interact with your account is not changing and there is no action required on your part.

**What is changing in the Master Securities Lending Agreement (MSLA)?**

Apex Clearing Corp will begin holding customer collateral in a collateral account at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Wilmington Trust will be the trustee for the account and charged with verifying collateral amounts posted to meet Apex obligations. End investors will see no changes to the program, eligibility, or income you may receive from lending securities.

**When does this change take effect?**

April 22nd, 2021

**As an investor, do I have an account I can directly access with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.?**

No, this account has been established for all investors enrolled in the FPSL program. While the funds from borrowed shares have been delivered to investors in compliance with the customer protection rule (Rule 15c3-3), this deposit is collateral held against securities on loan. The deposits from this account are only available in the event of a default or inability for Apex to return borrowed shares back to the investor.
