I made a quick mashup of the tendieman acapella and the 220 kid tiktok remix of Wellerman.

I really liked the tiktok remix but just couldn't handle that it had the wrong lyrics!

It's kinda shit though tbh, I'm terrible at editing, so if anyone can help me make this more on-beat and perhaps better mixed and mastered, please feel free to contact me (tried to just link the project but doesn't seem to be allowed).

18,mfn38h,"So was reading some of the Avanza stock news and saw that Citadel Europe has started shorting the Swedish stock ''Scandic Hotels Group'' alongside some other hedge fund companies and now already a total of 3,79% of the stock is shorted. Theres also some news about the company taking in 1,6 billion in convertibles next week which to be honest I do not know what a convertible is.  


Anyways just some news about dodgy hedgefunders doing shorting, do with the information as you please, just remember I am not a financial advisor and I don't know shit about stocks.  


heres the link to the Avanza article: [https://www.avanza.se/placera/telegram/2021/03/29/scandic-hotels-citadel-europe-ny-blankare-med-13-av-kap.html](https://www.avanza.se/placera/telegram/2021/03/29/scandic-hotels-citadel-europe-ny-blankare-med-13-av-kap.html)

TLDR: There are two posts which have received substantial upvotes in the range of 14-15k+ each over the last day. Though the more recent post provides a far better explanation of the massive volumes we have been seeing than the DD released before it ( it has SI &gt;2000% in its title, many of you have probably seen it already), 

I think it's still really important to take into consideration many of the other points made in the first of the two DD posts,  as they can help explain the concept of Wash Sales and how they're connected to the Massive Volume ""glitches"" explained by the more recent post.

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&amp;#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation &amp; Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&amp;#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&amp;#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
