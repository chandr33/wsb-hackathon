GME and RKT are restricted on TDA. Looking at RKT option chain they might need to buy 27 million shares this weekend **AND IT""S ONLY MONDAY 🚀🚀🚀**

**Some fun RKT stats:**

104 million share float

121 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders

BILLION $$$ Buy Back

Guided Q1 UUUPPPP 90%-99% YoY

&amp;#x200B;

Fintel  says 115 Million shares in the float, Finvis shows 113 milliom shr float

**AND here are the stats from someone who ran the options from the weekend post**

RKT - $25.01 - Mon Mar 15, 2021 09:30 EST

Weighted Avg IV: 105.02%, Shares: 2,000,000,000, **Float: 104,277,185**, SI: 43,091,520 (37.47%)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So this looks like RKT buy back is running

Also of note every time RKT got close to $28 last week shorts came in hvy which means 

1) They are 🧛‍♂️🦇🩸 

2) Instead of covering for a small lose they are wanting it again 🌈🐻 = 💀💀💀

&amp;#x200B;

BTW the CEO said intertest rates wont hurt RKT so when 🌈🐻🤡 cry that they are going up, I like to remind them that the difference between 1.5% and 1.6% (hahahaha, hey they are desperate)  wouldn't stop me from buying.",RKT FLOAT IS GETTING SMALLER 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 RKT &amp; GME ARE RESTRICTED ON TDA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,1.0,1615835795,YoLO-Mage-007

84,m5smdq,"Guys let’s be real, especially with the people who can’t afford to baghold. This is a volatile meme stock and it’s going down. 

I am not sure why y’all bother looking at iborrow. They always have shares to borrow and always will. The interest rate will remain low because big money has enough pull to get the interest rate lowered. SSR clearly doesn’t matter, they clearly have the power to drill the stock down anyway. 

This curve looks nearly identical to the one in Jan and that means GME is on its way to 40 again. The floor may be high because of the amount of shares purchased, but that won’t help  people 200+.

This may be something some of you may not want to hear. This time the stock may not come back up. So many big players have sold. You see the posts all the time. People paying off their houses, buying cars, gain porn, tattoos, etc. 

The people who scream “diamond hands”, “HODL”, “I like the stock”, and all that jazz, either are holding super good positions, or can afford to hold. If you’re $300+, struggling mentally, or financially you should be careful right now. The curve is going down again and the shorts may or may not have covered enough to keep it down for a long time. 

I don’t give financial advice and I just want everyone to succeed.
