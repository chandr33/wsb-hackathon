25,m224x7,"So, i started my trading career with the start of GME saga. I was trying to learn how to do stocks. Suddenly, GME was everywhere. I joined the reddit again(was in for technology around 10 years ago, account got deactivated caz of no activity) to ride the GME bandwagon. Was in to learn about stocks but ended up learning about STONKS and the fact that they only go up. 

I’m lossin my sleep over the fact that I’m gonna be millionaire. I only used to dream about it but now I’ll be caz of you fellow apes.

I entered when GME was coming down from peak, around $275, had $500 Canadians in my account. 

Learned so much about STONKS and being an APE 🦍. started putting more money into my account on every paycheque. Working on minimum wage and meeting bills at the end of the months made it little hard to invest money.

You 🦍 apes taught me to average down so i bought some more STONKS each paycheque and managed to average down to $145. 

Now, in these couple of months I learned a lot, not just about the STONKS but about the INJUSTICE in the system which is rigid and made to benefit the rich.
I almost put my entire life saving into it, which is about $8000 Canadians. 

First, i was in to make money but now I’ll ride till it hits the HEDGIES in their nuts.

Firstly, i was happy with the dream of $1000 but now you apes and DFV showed me the potential of STONKS. 
It’s $500000+ or peanuts 🥜 now.

I have 18 STONKS, will sell my forst at $100000 and then will wait for the peak and will sell accordingly.

Thanks for listening to me for all this time.
I’ll stay with you apes after this all over and we sit woth our tendies.

I really respect you guys to teach me how to STONKS.

Now $500000+ or bust.

45,m225xd,"LUMN has been one of the value plays that's gotten a lot of money shifting out of high growth tech the past couple of weeks, and if that trend continues, it should have a lot more upside over the next few months.

Lumen is the old CenturyLink rebranded (the telecom that bought Level 3 which basically runs a lot of the internet backbone in the US).  The stock was punished due to indebtedness and reduced earnings from cord cutting by residential customers over the years, but it has basically pushed most of its debt out years as it focuses on the transition to fiber and 5G (only 30% of its debt matures the next half-decade and that's all easily manageable through free cash flow).

The stock has entered a long-term channel where it's found significant support/resistance over the past 5 years, and if it breaks above, I think it will basically be cleared for a big run.  It's picked up support from institutions due to the strong dividend and that also has helped it to attract buying flows as a value play.

It was one of the stocks that rocketed in January due to the GME fueled market-wide short squeeze, but has been a straggler this week as high growth tech has attempted to find its bottom.

Still, I think the mid-term outlook for value stocks is probably better than high growth stocks given valuation levels and the likelihood of a big uptick in inflation in the 2nd half of this year as vaccinations and pent-up demand release a huge amount of consumer-driven demand in the economy.

Here's the chart and how it could play out over the next few months:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/shob1z6kc8m61.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a817eefe660e0c5579c00eb4cdae5b8b1b642ca2

And this is look at the 4 year chart so you can see the channel it's entered (and why it's important as a place of support/resistance):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pa98scivc8m61.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2baa68e905d98688c276a0534a97e3d59b57ac3f

I expect short-term consolidation in the channel or maybe a bit below (which is a good place to buy for cheaper calls), but any breakout should be explosive and would be hard to play if it happens since calls would probably become expensive fast very quickly.

Easiest way to play it is to just buy long-dated calls out to July or October.  Something like July $17.50 calls or October $20 calls are pretty cheap right now because IV is surprisingly low on a stock that's experienced the past 3 months that it has.  If you want to play more aggressively, something like April 16 $15 or $16 calls are pretty cheap all things considered.

I own April/July/October calls, and I anticipate holding them at least the next couple of weeks to see whether there's more money flow going from growth to value.

This is also a decent hedge position to have alongside high growth tech if you do own that (as I do).",LUMN (Lumen Technologies) should have a lot more upside as the transition to value continues,1.0,1615395428,zg44
