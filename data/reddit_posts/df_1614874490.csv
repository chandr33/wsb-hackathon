After a long hiatus (banned for mentioning a SPAC that went from 10 to 60 back to 24, and AMC before it was 1 billion in value). I have returned for the next big opportunity. Honestly there are a few with the recent route in the market, but here is opportunity #1 in my opinion based on technical and internal financial information.

Alibaba ticker BABA: But OP, china risk, and regulation, and it’s down 26.25% from its high of $317.14! STFU and keep reading:

[Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (BABA : NYSE) Stock Price &amp; News - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BABA:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijpci4gZfvAhUaGVkFHT4EDsoQ3ecFMAB6BAgGEBo)

Yup that’s why I love the company. Alibaba posted better than expected earnings beating on top and bottom with growth YOY 36% yeah that’s amazing. Because fundamentally nothing has changed. It’s current P/e is an amazingly low 25.93x yes, a company growing 30% YOY is trading below its growth rate and further the sector average P/e is 49.18x Now I know we are fucking retarded here so based on basic math BABA is valued at half of its competitors. That’s a buy signal alone as if it can reach the same valuation; get ready: it doubles from this price.

But OP China is going to regulate big Chinese tech! No, China wants to be the leader in tech and can’t afford to cut the legs from its largest most profitable companies. The recent “NEWS” on the clamping down of its tech companies is in my opinion noise. Think of it this way: When FB was fined in the EU they fined FB $122 Million dollars. Ouch. (But not really because: day do be rich doh! FB is in a similar BABA spot in the USA I like it too) China’s fine to Alibaba? 76k [China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals) Yeah… that’s a serious reprimand… This is classic China manipulation of their publicly traded companies to reduce the price before they rocket higher. They do this very often in the penny stock area of the market. This time they just went bigger. ANT ipo? Still on, they just are requiring higher cash reserves for the lending arm. What does that mean? It means that the loans provided by ANT will have better backing and will be less likely for default. Further ANT deals with digital money and the people’s republic of china government has already said they are looking to Alibaba to help roll out with a digital yuan. See what’s going on here? China is publicly reprimanding a company that it is actively working with to bring in the future. [MYbank, backed by Alibaba's Ant Group, joins China's digital yuan pilot (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/mybank-backed-by-alibabas-ant-group-joins-chinas-digital-yuan-pilot.html)

Ignore the noise, ignore the “Smart Money” they have a time horizon of 2 weeks. We have the time horizon of DIAMONDS!!

My position is 6 BABA 280p sold short at $61 I also have 5 credit spreads 290/300p

TL:DR BABA could double based on its current valuation and the fact that it continues to grow, is picked by government to work on digital currency roll out and its low P/e","Alibaba DD Becuase, I'm sick of GME/AMC/PLTR..... (insert meme shit)",0.52,1614874728,Alien8w8

Yesterday I posted the P/C ratios for GME. The massive number of contracts seemed like a sure sign that Hedgies are betting Big that GMe will go down.. here is the link to that shitshow [Shitshow of a post sorry for title I like money I swear](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx3s5d/when_will_they_ever_learn_it_never_was_about_the/)

[MARCH 3rd 2021, 3:37pm](https://preview.redd.it/b21jb7uy61l61.png?width=1865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614c1e067e334f01b4c7078dc21f0249ea5e8c83)

I’ve been watching different companies on here to see the market sentiment/ in which way the institutional buyers are betting the stock will go in.. I dont really understand what most of this means since I only started eating crayons a month ago but according to retards its a good thing there is so many puts.. OR IS THERE??!?!?!?!!

[MARCH 4th, 2021 9:14am](https://preview.redd.it/e8ltw1ve71l61.png?width=1847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=321834221f809c548b81c7c27a9729bcc0f93f73)

These numbers barely changed from March 3rd before closing to March 5 pre market, only increased—-&gt; meaning driving the price of gme down because long term option contracts betting against gme, but gme is doing good now and LOOKS even better later so wtf?

The next screenshot will be from ONE HOUR INTO MARKET OPEN MARCH 4 EST TIME

[March 4th,2021, 10:30AM](https://preview.redd.it/bi2eagtk71l61.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adbf4034819f814fda793b59a31532aa862eac11)

**What the fuck? Where are all the hundreds of thousands of put options???**

My guess is that Hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down  during lunch hours, when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40% gains everyday due to SI...

These orders all stayed in, the first 10 even 20 minutes of market open..I thought they probably won’t change since I just started to actually use bren, but then I look and its way different...

Some of y’all are gonna hate but Ive been watching RKT alongside since this week.. Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?

Edit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??

 Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  “ dividend news”  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..

So they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby

Mind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1/3 of their float because there wasn’t a high demand, the news “oddly didnt cover or care about their debut” which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover?? Especially with such low amount of shares avail to short and such an insanely massive borrow rate???

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: GME NEW UPDATE, THE MASSIVE PUT OPTIONS ARE BACK!

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking at the RKT short interest and its insanely high??? I dont have the tools or smooth brain to actually know what 97% of this means but for some reason it tickles my pickle

[RKT SI](https://preview.redd.it/2wpxmsdkb1l61.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdca1d45559946f98da204d21baecb510fc3c725)

Is it normal for a stock to have 57% short interest borrow fee rate?? And only 75k shares to be available on a stock that has 100m shares outstanding???

It was posted on here [Shill Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lwdhbk/proof_that_rkt_is_yet_another_hf_pump_and_dump/)

This is the short interest on GME, compare it to RKT,

[GME SHORT INTEREST](https://preview.redd.it/gp4o686rc1l61.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ff4243db7ff4f724667bda4d84b818cdcfbf283)

TL;DR KEEP HODLING GME, ONLY BUY IF U CAN AT DIPS, ROCKET IS READY, REFUELING!

GME IS STILL GONNA ROCKET TO THE MOON BUT RKT COULD BE EZ MONEY GAINS OR QUITE HEAVY LOSS PORN  
( a lot of ppl already profited off it including myself, very high SI%, CEO hates shooters, low shares avail to borrow and borrow rate is 44% last I checked March 4th 2pm... I dont think its the end, I think more profits are possible because everyone keeps saying DONT BUY RKT and when ppl say dont buy It makes me want to buy because im retarded haha)

There is a lot of things I cant find because of my limited resources, or because im not smooth brained enough to understand. If anyone finds this useful ill be happy, I could be 100% wrong here, thats actually my specialty. I hope some
