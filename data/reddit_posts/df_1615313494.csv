Eden, their program they use to track produce was stolen from zest corporation. The trial was recently postponed back in June 2020 due to covid, but the new trial is set for March 29th 2021.
You can do you own due diligence on protrack website which shows the court documentation, but with text messages and the timing of everything, it seems like Walmart had its hand in the cookie jar and now a company is fighting back.
Basically when the settlement occurs, it gets spread between the stock holders into their share price, so a small $15 could be a retirement fund for someone looking for a home run. 

Please do your own due diligence, but I have done mine and have been in this for over a year now after hearing about it.

51,m1cmkd,"First of all, CONGRATULATIONS TO GME &lt;3!!! Since there are plenty of DD's on GME already, lets take a look at what might be possible factors that drive up the price as well as bearish sentiments on UWMC!

\*\* I expect some hate due to it not being GME, but its how it is lately\*\*

I would like to first state that for those APES that are wondering why the price was steady at $10\~, its because it was a SPAC. 

**First here are my positions:**

**Positions**: 500@8.35

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xdnd1pdkl1m61.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdbb4fe1494ee40038e4bcbfb3b8eeb2f00721f5

**Short Volume Ratio (UWMC):**

https://preview.redd.it/gp0z3amaj1m61.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c410bde31da47628bf58461a2e031a95c0ab48

**Short Volume:** Total number of short shares traded on the major US markets each day

**Short Volume Ratio:** Total number of short shares traded divided by the total shares traded each day    


Above is defined by fintel.

&amp;#x200B;

As of 09/03/2021 the short interest for:

**UWMC:** 31%

**GME:** 24%

&amp;#x200B;

**What does this mean? This means that there is a possibility of a short squeeze here.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the call options for 19/03/2021:**

https://preview.redd.it/008aw2gtl1m61.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=505df1c3c53170ca17b469f08a7b2898f68a06f8

**Take note of the option volumes at 9.00 and 10.00 in particular.**

Should the price of UWMC cause these options to be ITM at any time, it indicates potential for a gamma squeeze. 

In order for a gamma squeeze to happen, according to /u/swaggymedia certain conditions need to be met.  The example he used was with AMD, but applies to UWMC as well. 

 

&gt;Last 2 weeks AMD has been having very LARGE call buying in strikes all over the board (back when the stock was about $54). Heavy volume of call buying in all strikes: $57.50/$60/$62.50/etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;MM's hedge according to how big the position is and how far OTM it is. Basically hedging just enough to cover the probability of the stock rising. Typically they hedge with buying shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;As stock price increases and the large volume of calls become closer to being in-the-money, the MMs need to continue hedging with the upward momentum. They can either: buy more shares to remain delta neutral, or bring shares to the market (selling shares) to push the price back down.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are various conditions where they buy shares vs selling shares, and that depends on the borrow rate, share float, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Long-story short it creates an infinite loop of chasing the stock upwards from MM who continuously try and hedge by purchasing stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is a solid DD in the comments by** /u/DiZzyBonne **that deserves its own DD section tbh.**

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;UPDATE: The video I'm talking about is linked here: [https://fb.watch/46IwO4w5sC/](https://fb.watch/46IwO4w5sC/)  
&gt;  
&gt;\---  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm gonna chime in here, UWM is my specialty. I'm in the mortgage business, and my company sends most of our loans to UWM.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today the CEO made a ballsy move. I'm on mobile, so I'll keep it short. But you can look for UWM's Facebook page and watch the live video for more info.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, he cut his rate prices by about 100 basis points (1% for you apes who don't mortgage). What that means for the consumer is now it'll cost you 1% less to get that rate you wanted. This is great because this past Friday, mortgage rates went up at the federal level, so this helps bring them down again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since UWM is the industry-leader in wholesale business, all other lenders are going to follow suit and also lower their rates, so this is a win-win for everybody.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quick rundown, in order to get a mortgage you have to go to a loan officer. They work either for a broker or for a retail lender. If they work for a broker, they can shop around for you with lots of different lenders. If they work retail, they can only work with the lender they work with. Nothing wrong with either option. Rocket, however, has both a wholesale and retail channel. You can get a loan with Rocket direct from their website, or you can go to a broker.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following so far? No? Good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the most ballsy play is UWM fighting Rocket because Rocket is super shady. Rocket claims to be on the broker's side, yet they keep doing things to fuck over brokers. One of those things is Rocket is offering programs for real estate agents to get their loan officer license in 20 days, and in turn, the realtor just needs to send their business directly to Rocket, and they'll pay the realtor for their business. That's shady because if you claim to be helping out brokers, why would you go and do something like that to steal business from them? They also like to take the loans that you submit to them through wholesale, then turn around and steal the client and do a loan for them through their own retail channel, completely cutting out the broker.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now for those who don't know, UWM is strictly wholesale lending (meaning you need to go to a loan officer who works for a broker to get a loan with UWM), and Rocket has a wholesale and retail channel.  
&gt;  
&gt;See the conflict? Rocket has two channels, retail and wholesale. They have two ways to make money. They don't care if they screw over wholesale, because they'll always have another way to make money.  
&gt;  
&gt;So UWM is saying that brokers who continue to do business with Rocket will no longer be able to submit loans to UWM. Super ballsy, but tons of brokers are already signing addendums to their contract, so now UWM is going to generate even more business.  
&gt;  
&gt;My broker used to send about an equal number of loans to UWM and Rocket, but now we're ditching Rocket and sticking with UWM (but we still have plenty of other options if we don't pick UWM for whatever reason, maybe a certain loan program, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, the tl;dr, UWM lowered costs on rates and is about to generate a TON more business. On top of already being the #1 wholesale lender in the US, they're going to be the #1 wholesale lender on the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've owned UWM since GHIV, and I plan to hold for years. If this spikes to $20, I'm not selling. This is a long-term investment for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not financial advice, I like the stock. And I really do love UWM. I hate working with Rocket, their underwriters are clueless and their whole system is made for retail (wholesale was always a second idea for them, they even said so themselves.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Sorry for the shit editing and my thoughts being so sporadic, it's almost 1 AM and I'm on mobile, so I don't feel like going back to make my post more coherent. If you want clarification, let me know and I'll reply.

Trend Indicators:

1 Bollinger Bands - slight upwards trend

3 Parabola (daily) - bullish signal

2 Ichimoku Cloud (daily) - strong and accurate signal for hitting resistance line (which is the green line of the ichimoku cloud), bearish signals as well with a declining base line.

2 Stochastics (daily) - slightly bearish, I believe this will change after today's rally so keeping an eye on this.

2 Stochastics (weekly) - bullish signal

MACD - inaccurate slightly bullish signal

RSI - oversold

3 TSI - oversold and bullish trend

Volatility Indicators:

3) Average True Range - huge volatility ahead

1. Bollinger Bands - increasing volume

Conclusion:

Mixed signals, but overall mostly bullish signs from recent price action. Regardless of price, every indicator is signaling an upcoming storm of volatility. Of course this is bias as I am a shareholder, but I believe there is an upcoming short term up-trend.

86,m1cqod,"Because looking at the price action, it's $14,564 a share now and 2022 was a tough year for me. I had to build this time machine and it wasn't cheap so I have to cover my costs, I'm sorry.

I will take some of the proceeds and and donate it to the WallStreetBets Museum of Autism on 5th Avenue in Manhattan that opened last week; the original piss-drinking martini glass was amazing to see in person as was DFV's headband.

It's a bit lonely on earth now that the population has dropped by 9.4m but I will hopefully catch you on the next $TSLA moon flight next week. Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?

95,m1cria,"I grabbed them back at 10$ and I'm still holding.I don't see the movie theater concept ever fully going away as a business model. I understand it's certainly already peaked in terms of its hold on the entertainment market, but I see it maintaining, at the very least, a niche spot in consumer pleasure spending. I know many people love the experience of going to a theater to see a movie. A/V stimulation is still a huge drug for the masses, and a movie theater still hits the spot better than a laptop or TV can.
