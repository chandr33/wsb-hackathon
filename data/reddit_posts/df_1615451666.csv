73,m2m6xy," Info from the CEO on AMC outstanding shares is huge!

450mil-287mil= synthetic shares 163mil

Current short intrest is calculated in function of the outstanding shares, data shows 25.68% as of Feb 26, could be more if manipulated (shorting ETFs)

0.2568\*450mil=115.56mil shares short

(actual short intrest (possible higher is the 25% is manipulated): 115.56/287=40%

Shares that need to be bought at some point:

115.56+163.56+(Expiring call options)=278.56 mil

Expiring call options included, more than a 100% of existing shares need to be bought.

The Hedgies shifted the problem by diluting the outstanding shares and shorting ETFs(which does not show on the short intrest)

Why did the utilisation, number of shorts available and the fee go down:

They created fake shares and dropped it into the market (remember they are in survival mode). People bought those shares. Their broker can use those shared to lend them to be shorted (utilisation down). Price down and more shares available for shorting-&gt;less risk shorting -&gt;shorting fee went down. Keep hold, they manipulate the number to give the illusion that they are not screwed, but are only shifting the problem to a less visible spot","AMC to the moon fellow gorillas, correct me if I am too retarded for math",1.0,1615454042,Gogogogog123

I bet some of you didn't think pay up time would be coming so soon! You must have forgotten- stocks only go up.

For now, here's a little list I've amalgamated for your pleasure:

u/zeusthunder: [$500 butt tat, $700 pic of wife's boobs apres titty job bought by tendies](https://imgur.com/a/FKAB5Im)

[u/steelhead-addict](https://www.reddit.com/u/steelhead-addict/): [Woodstock on ass tattoo $500](https://imgur.com/a/nvousxS)

[u/italian20914](https://www.reddit.com/u/italian20914/): [WSB tattoo $500](https://imgur.com/a/KIcn5dp)

[u/Jduubu](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jduubu/): [""Power to the players"" tattoo if it hits $500](https://imgur.com/a/YNMOePC)

[u/buttmunch8](https://www.reddit.com/u/buttmunch8/): [Will donate $1000 to charity if it hits $1000](https://imgur.com/a/ocVKLTQ)

[u/quantumdrive95](https://www.reddit.com/u/quantumdrive95/): [Honey Nut Cheerios Bee tattoo on ass if $75 by end of year](https://imgur.com/a/piKHiRy) \- I'm paying attention still, don't worry! I think we'll be seeing you (and your ass) real soon!

One of my favourites because it's kind of inevitable:

[u/ingamemax](https://www.reddit.com/u/ingamemax/): [n.i.o. logo tattooed on his butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/m0tm1r/i_will_get_a_nio_logo_tattooed_on_my_butt_if/) if it hits $80.00 by EOY.

Special mention:

[u/yotta\_T100](https://www.reddit.com/u/yotta_T100/) You made your bet [January 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0hhqg/gme_thread_the_wreckoning/gjtheqk/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), that happened quite a while ago! What the heck have you been doing? One mod showed you grace and gave you until the 16 to get your tattoo- oh you bet your bottom dollar it's saved in my phone! Same date as my proctologist exam, apparently forcing poop out of your butt before noon so that you can buy a certain amount of a stock is NOT healthy for your bowels. Just remember- poop before noon, Ro8lox to the moon!

I read up.  I did my best to DD.  I suck at it, but I tried.  In the end, I trusted my limited knowledge and (mostly) the info in that post.  I threw what I had into 3/12 calls.

99,m2mcxv,"Have you seen iCarly and all these cartoons trending top 10 on Netflix this entire pandemic?

Netflix market cap is ~225B as of 3/11/2021.

Ask a kid how much they like Roblox compared to Netflix. I’d imagine many would say they like both equally, at least half as much. Maybe even 25% as much. (If you have little siblings or kids ask them and post what they say)

But if they like it half as much, RBLX market cap should theoretically be 112.5B. At 40B market cap, RBLX is undervalue. 

Also, Cathie bought the IPO so that signals RBLX might actually be severely undervalue.",Why RBLX is undervalue by at least 2.5X (Straightforward DD),1.0,1615454754,sqesla
