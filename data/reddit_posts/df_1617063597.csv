A tasty dividend yield and impressive fiscal data put UWMC stock far above ""meme"" status

By David Moadel, InvestorPlace Contributor Mar 26, 2021, 3:31 pm EDT

With the press coverage of Reddit group r/WallStreetBets, some traders are hunting for the next big meme stock. Moreover, there‚Äôs been speculation that the next Reddit run-up target could be real estate loan originator UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC). But, is this the only reason to own UWMC stock?

Wagering your hard-earned capital on a Reddit-fueled short squeeze isn‚Äôt my idea of a solid investing strategy. Instead, I would recommend focusing on the merits of the company you‚Äôd be investing in.

If you‚Äôd like to learn more about UWMC and its status as a Reddit stock, I invite you to check out InvestorPlace contributor Robert Lakin‚Äôs excellent article which covers that topic, as well as the insightful article written by contributor Brenden Rearick.

Now, we‚Äôll dive into the stock head-first, starting with a brief analysis its recent price action.

A Closer Look at UWMC Stock

Probably one of the main reasons UWMC stock might be viewed as a meme stock is because of its wild price movements.

7 Risky Stocks Ready to Roll on Reopening
Actually, the share price was fairly steady for a significant part of 2020. There were a number of months in which the stock stayed close to the $10 level.

That‚Äôs not unusual for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) stock. As Josh Enomoto pointed out, UWM Holdings went public through a reverse merger with a SPAC known as Gores Holdings.

UWMC broke out of the $10 area in late December of 2020, and even touched a 52-week high of $14.38. That would have been a great time to take profits as a swift decline ensued after that.

Shockingly, by the end of February 2021, the stock had plunged to around $7.50. There was a slight recovery following that drop, though, as the share price climbed back up to $8.50 in mid-March.

Before we move on to the basics on the company, there‚Äôs one more important detail about UWMC stock. Namely, it offers a forward annual dividend yield of about 4.45%, which ought to entice some income-focused investors.

Record-Setting Results

One of the best ways to convince prospective investors that this isn‚Äôt just a Reddit stock, would be to reveal UWM Holdings‚Äô recent fiscal data.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, UWM Holdings reported record originations totaling $54.7 billion in loan volume. That represents a 71% increase compared to the year-ago quarter.

With that, another record was shattered as UWM Holdings‚Äôs full-year 2020 originations production came to $182.5 billion. This number signified a 69% increase over the company‚Äôs prior record production for 2019 of $107.8 billion.

On top of all that, during 2020‚Äôs fourth quarter, UWM Holdings recorded net income of $1.37 billion. We must admit, that‚Äôs a huge improvement over the $148.9 million in net income posted during the fourth quarter of 2019.

UWM Holdings President and CEO Mat Ishbia called the quarter ‚Äúphenomenal‚Äù and frankly, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs earned the right to brag a little bit.

A Jumbo Product

Far from a ‚Äúmeme,‚Äù UWM Holdings could actually be considered an innovator in the real estate business.

The company‚Äôs recently announced product is known as Prime Jumbo. This is designed to make life easier for mortgage brokers as it provides them with a product that facilitates fast closing on loans of up to $2 million with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 89.99%.

The company underscored the flexibility of Prime Jumbo, stating that it‚Äôs ‚Äúavailable on purchases, rate/term refinances, and cash out as well as on primary, secondary residences and investment properties.‚Äù

As Ishbia explains, Prime Jumbo ‚Äúlevels the playing field for brokers to get their jumbo borrowers into their dream homes or refinance into a lower rate.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a highly competitive product that could make life easier for both independent mortgage brokers and borrowers.

The Bottom Line

UWMC stock is a fast mover ‚Äì there‚Äôs no denying that. Still, investors don‚Äôt need to view the stock as just a potential short-squeeze target.

Rather, they should take a close look at what UWM Holdings has to offer. The company appears to have solid fiscal stats and innovative product ideas.

Moreover, UWM Holdings offers a generous dividend yield. So, don‚Äôt focus on the ‚Äúmeme‚Äù ‚Äì just focus on what‚Äôs meaningful.",UWM Holdings Is a Worthy Investment in Innovative Real Estate,1.0,1617064066,CommunicationIll570

I am having difficulty understanding the basics of a long vs short position in trading foreign currencies. I know you should take a long position if you expect the currency to rise, and a short position if you expect the currency to fall. The problem is calculating the profit. For example, the British pound appreciated relative to US currency from January 19 to March 16. On January 19 the exchange rate was 1.3644 GBP/USD. On March 16, the exchange rate was 1.3901 GBP/USD. The Pound obviously got stronger. I have to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù $100,000 USD into GBP. This means I could buy 73,292.29 pounds on January 19 and sell for 71,937.27 on March 16. Does this mean I have a profit of 1,355.02 pounds? When I convert this back to USD, the profit should be $974.76 (1,355.02 pounds divided by the current exchange rate of 1.3901). Also, if I took a short position it would be a loss of $974.76? Any help would be appreciated.

9 Meters Biopharma (***NMTR****: Nasdaq*) has been of interest to me since 2019. At the time, I was following several dozen instruments, with research strongly indicating *~~OGI~~* and *~~HEXO~~* having the potential to increase in excess of 140%. For those who bought early, both exceeded predictions for return on initial investment by order of magnitudes.

NMTR is also on my radar for 2021. 

It's what I categorize as real investing, because it's a company that focuses on treatment of gastrointestinal illnesses, which are not disappearing on their own. So far, it has outperformed 64% of its sector and outpaced the *~~S&amp;P 500~~*. Analysts give it a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù to ‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù without any sell indicators. In other words, it‚Äôs very promising. Long term predictions suggest this investment could be worth $9/share in years to come. I see that as more of a 5 year investment based on current trends, and could be well worth the wait.

Recent market volume for NMTR is lower, but there was quite a bit of activity last week with 2 M sold and just less than 3 M bought in one day. In December, my initial predictions were a price drop during February and May with a floor of $1.26/share, but we're seeing this between both months as the dip occurs in March at $1.30. This time of year realizes some dropping prices and panic sellers, making instruments like this an economical buy for those with patience. 

It could be months, or even a year before this investment is realized. I just wanted to put a heads-up out there for those who have some extra cash sitting in their investment account collecting dust. The 12-month prediction is +100 to 400%. 

**TL:DR:** Patience in important. Analysts predictions are $3-$6/share, while current price is about $1.32. It's long term, unlike your wife's boyfriend.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Also, consider Frequency Therapeutics (***FREQ****: Nasdaq*) as a long-term hold; this is a company researching progenitors to target hearing loss and reverse the effects, which currently are mostly untreatable. This one is quite important to me. A couple years ago I started looking into some type of treatment, but Frequency Therapeutics' approach seems more advanced than the others I read about.

Frequency Therapeutics' studies claim that we could regrow the cells in our cochlea, a key organ in each ear responsible for our sense of hearing and balance. Currently, the genetic process to regrow these cells is there, but is turned off. As we age and the 15,000 cells in each ear are damaged or die, we develop tinnitus (ringing) and/or hearing loss. The repair and regrow process is not naturally activated in the human species. Frequency Therapeutics is isolating a precise method to activate the cells' progenitors to regrow and form new, healthy hearing cells without affecting other tissue nor adopting gene altering therapies. 

A sudden drop in price this month has put FREQ's price per share below half of the assessed fair market value. An investor could gain +100 to 680% in a year or so. 

**TL:DR:** Current price is about $8.15 with a one-year outlook of $37 ($20 low, $56 high). Worthwhile company agenda that can save your hearing and earn you some money.

On the contrary! Spin your speculative webs!

If you look at the last five years of Tesla‚Äôs history, their prices SKYROCKETED when covid hit, as did most. This was before the fear of inflation, as stimmy checks were not discussed or introduced yet and the lockdowns were believed to be only temporary. Then came the stimmy checks, allowing millions to gamble with free money, further uplifting the market. Then came the gme/robinhood frenzy which further stimulated the market, with personal cash and first time investors. All this hype and free money has led to what I believe to be the largest stock inflation in the past 5 years ie. nearly every stock across then board is heavily overpriced. I dot not believe this will last forever and I think if we look at the past 5 months we can see this hype/free-money-frenzy starting to die down. As the lockdowns begin to end we‚Äôre going to be seeing a lot of people spending their money on other things, clothes, movies, dinners, friends, etc. and putting their stocks into companies that offer these things, removing cash from other stocks. It‚Äôs for this reason that I believe Tesla is going to return to near pre-covid levels in the next three months and as I‚Äôve pointed out it has been in a steady decline for the past three months. I believe Tesla, as well as many others are going to continue falling in price as firms and big investors continue to cash in on first time investor bets, small investors pull out due to inflation fear and the wsb/gme hype dies down due to lack free stimmy money that a majority of its base relies on. If I had to guess, I believe Tesla will return to levels around the 150-300 mark in the next three to four months and stick. This could be a great opportunity for long term investors. We could wait for prices to drop from the inflated prices were seeing now but then again I may be wrong and right now might be the best time to buy Tesla. Its a gamble, buy now while it‚Äôs near its three month all time low, or wait for what I believe to be a pretty likely decline. But who knows i‚Äôm retarded.

However, I've not seen too many posts drawing attention to the price of the golden arches being used to gauge market confidence. America's favorite drive-thru restaurant is FUCKING HUGE, and world wide, and even if Hedgie's blow up the market with financial fuckery, investors can always trust in the ice-cream machines working! **THAT DOESNT MEAN BUY IT NOW!**!! It still falls like everything else, BUT let's see how it compares to the overall market...

Below I've provided a comparison to MickeyDee's against the S&amp;P 500 going back to 2015.

By the comparison you see that when MickeyDee's rises a significant amount, outside of it's given trend, we see the market dip pretty soon after, usually within 2-4 weeks. 

Some people that finished high school argue that it's because of investor's not being sure of the economy and wanting to hedge their bets. Think of it like investing in gold when shit hits the fan, only it's the Golden Arches. 

And something about investors finding cyclicals, but I still haven't found my wife's yet.

If you zoom into July you could also argue that it did/didn't predict a slide in stocks, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other 4 times so I left it out.

We all heard of Tulip mania, but lets step that shit up to Pok√©mon TCG mania level. Story time; not number time. Keep in mind, Pok√©mon = GME in this story.

Pok√©mon came out in 1999, folks went crazy over it, and become a commodity investment for many. Come a few years later, the craze dies down, and that huge value which was market wise for cards has died down. I‚Äôm sure many of y‚Äôall remember but the masses wrote off Pok√©mon; you go to any hobby store and try to sell your stuff, they offered pennies on the dollar or wont buy at all.¬†

Most folks toss the cards away, including me (fuck me, 1st edition raichu holo that would pay for my kids college, used as some hamster bedding). Then there were some who said fuck no, this has value. Either store it away, or keep collecting.

Fast forward a decade or so, add some Elliot wave theory, and here we are today. Have you see the value of that shit in the last months or years? A box of original factory sealed booster packs went for $150,000+ In recent times.¬†

TL;DR:¬†Don‚Äôt repeat history, the market markers aka hobby stores discounted Pok√©mon to oblivion to where it was dead; like GME. Here we are and its a fucking rebirth, prices skyrocketed, there is exponential demand, and little supply; prices moon.¬†","DD: Explanation of GME recently, using Pok√©mon TCG as a model",1.0,1617067226,A_KY_gardener

87,mg4p5t,"$JOAN is on sale right now and here's why I'm in:  
 
**Basics**  
Joann is a fabric and craft supplies store. They sell a wide range of fabric by the yard cut to order as well as sewing patterns and notions (thread, scissors, sewing machines, elastic, all the crap you need to sew something etc.) They also sell yarn, scrapbooking materials, beads, and craft paraphernalia like mason jar lids and cookie cutters. They have 865 brick and mortars and an excellent e-commerce site.     
When the pandemic hit and most of the their stores needed to close, Joann did a successful pivot to buy-online-with-curbside-pickup in half their stores. This allowed them to cement their status as the primary fabric source nationwide for sewing homemade masks.   
[This Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/joann-fabrics-pivots-e-commerce-224931627.html) breaks this down in more detail with quotes from the CIO on revamping distribution and supply chains.  

**Fundamentals**
Joann Fabrics has been around since the 1940's, first going public in 1969. They caught some charges  and got fined in 1997 for misleading investors about earnings re: securities and went private in 2011.   
Joann Fabric went public again on March 12th, 2021. It was anticipated to IPO at $15-17 but opened at $12.25 and is currently on sale for under $10.    
Their projected earnings for 2021 are $1.86B per Dun&amp;Bradstreet though Forbes lists their sales at $2.3B.     
Market cap is $405.7M

All SEC filings [here](https://investors.joann.com/financials/sec-filings)    

**Competition** 
There is no real competition of nation-wide fabric retailers. D&amp;B lists [their competitors on their profile page](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.jo-ann_stores_llc.ef69814ff0305986ebe85ac88fbd060a.html) which is mostly a joke.  
*Hancocks Fabrics -- went bankrupt and closed in 2016  
*A.C.Moore -- closed in Nov 2019 (and never sold fabric by the yard)     
*Michaels -- only possible competition, owns the IP from Hancocks and A.C. Moore but... *does not sell fabric* except pre-cut and packaged fat quarters    

The only other national competitors are:
*Hobby Lobby which is privately owned and has a small fabric section in their stores.   
*Walmart has a small section of fabric and notions in a small number of stores. Shitty selection and inconsistent quality.   

**Why I'm bullish**    
I love the stock.    
I love the store.   
If you sew or craft, being able to walk into a brick and mortar pre-pandemic and touch the fabric and yarn can be a big part of planning a project. If the fabric feels stiff or weird, you're not going to make a dress out of it.   
On the flip side, being able to go online and order more of the exact same same fabric or 25 skeins of the same yarn, shipped to your local Joann's for free curbside pickup is amazing.   
On a personal note, Joann's doing curbside during the pandemic allowed me to spend months last year sewing my ass off and giving away masks. Not to be too dramatic but that shit literally may have helped curb community spread and saved lives. There is growth potential in the number of crafters like me who learned to sew masks and are moving on to bigger sewing projects now.     

**Risks**
Since it opened at $12.25 the stock has fallen to $9.96 at it's lowest. I think it may be a slow growth stock but as the stock market money printer continues to go brrrrrrr I think there's real potential.   
The stock is so new there isn't an options market yet so I know some of you silverbacks are already out but I've bought in and will be diamondhanding this stock with my glue gun and glitter.   

Standard disclaimer: none of this is financial advice but you should really learn to sew.
