29,m1y8yh,"A few months ago my dad calls and checks if I’m doing alright, seeing my account is a little low. He’s been listed on my bank account since we created it together for me over 10 years ago when I was 16, just because.
I tell him yeah I had moved some stuff around because, well, GME was cooking and I liked the stock. He didn’t quite understand but told me to be careful and not to throw away anything I couldn’t afford to lose. He’s an ape at heart he just doesn’t know it.

Anyway, a month later and a few more paychecks and I average down while GME drops. I think I was at like, 20 averaged at 100 or so. Nothing incredible, but I had some faith. Talk to my dad again and he asks how it’s doing (he had since heard about the bad february and was curious what I had done) and I told him to have faith. In so many words I explained 💎 🙌. He laughs it off and says be careful.

One week ago, he calls again, and the conversation changes to GME once again rising. He says hey Yanno you were right, good job, how much did you make?
I explain there’s no exit plan and we’re in this until the moon (well, I told him the value in it could be much higher and it’d be foolish to let go now or anytime soon) and then he gets really serious.

""You’re telling me this is gonna keep going up?""
""Yeah dad, this is gonna keep going up.""

He then tells me he’s giving me $3,000 and to double it, but no pressure and he loves me either way. For a second over the phone Im blown away, that’s more than I’ve had to invest at any point in my life. It’s nothing huge, but that’s way more than I usually run around with Yanno?

""Dad you won’t regret this. I trust this stock.""
""I don’t trust that stock for shit. But I trust you.""

I got my dad in for 23 shares at around 130. He thinks he’s getting double, if anything. He doesn’t realize this is a moon ride.

Would the stock price just rocket up 10k&gt;20k&gt;50k&gt; 🚀💯? Would you then just sell at your threshold? If everyone starts selling at 50k, then can it actually go up to 100k?
OR;
If you set a limit sell of 25k, 50k, 100k... can they see your limit sells and because no one is selling just go and start buying up all the limit sells they see and can?

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m17a0w/uwmc\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m17a0w/uwmc_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing_and/)

Yesterday my DD On $UWMC gained a lot of traction and I've read most of the comments. I have to clarify an important thing so that retarded Apes 🦍 don't get injured on their journey to the promised Banana Island  🍌🏝️.

A lot of people have wrote in the comments yesterday that they are going to buy OTM 03/19 calls. You have to understand that there’s a likelihood that your money will burn and your calls will become worthless because (Hypothetically) some of the MM’s who sold you the calls have large institutional % and can always pull the price downwards by selling their stocks. They can do that (Hypothetical) to ensure that your calls expire worthless and they keep the money. 

(100% opinion) On the other hand, a person who buys stocks(not calls) is relatively safer(in my opinion) and will push the stock upwards(against MM’s) towards the +10$ where a gamma squeeze can potentially happen. In addition, bumping the stock up with buying shares could also potentially cause a short squeeze. So, a gamma squeeze on top of a short squeeze! (🚀🌕) The magic number is +10$! and it is unlikely to happen(in my opinion) with Call option buying.

Now you might ask, why is the magic number +10$ Look at Open interest bellow.

[I wouldn't buy anymore calls because it'd burn\(in my opinion\) without stocks pushing it upwards.](https://preview.redd.it/8ynss165l7m61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36ed6e5109c52b45aa4cb998fe9b515700456968)

In summary, the gamma squeeze and short squeeze both depend largely on buying stocks not calls in my opinion.
