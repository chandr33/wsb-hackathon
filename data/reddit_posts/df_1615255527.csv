Sup bros.

I say bros because that's what you guys are to me. My brothers in the trenches.

I bought 20 shares of GME on Wednesday 27th.

I read the DD.

I threw money I could afford to lose and then I got played.

We all got played. Vlad and Citadel fucked us.

We might never get to the end of that story, but we all know that we got greased up and used like some fuck toy. Some more than others. (You're still on RH? wtf are you doing you're actually retarded)

Now its been a minute since that fateful day in January. We have been tested and tried by our friends, our family, the media but we held strong. We sat through WEEKS of 40$ lows. Waiting. Patiently. A flicker of hope still shone in the dark. You think we're selling now you greedy fucks?

Some of us drank piss.

Some of us got divorced.

But we all held.

We held each other like Jack held Rose while the mother fucking titanic sank to the bottom of the god damn ocean. Today was just the tip of that glorious penis shaped iceberg that took the whole ship down.

And we're not fucking letting go.

I'm not only here for my tendies.

I'm here for my brothers tendies.

I'm here for my wife's boyfriends tendies.

I'm here for every Rolex watch on every Citadel execs. wrist.

I'm here to suck Wall Street fucking dry and rub their nose in the god damn shit stained swamp that they call the financial system.

And as the system burns to the fucking ground, I'll be blasting god damn sea shanties in my Lambo.

At this point telling you guys to hold is literally useless. You guys know what the fuck to do because you've been doing it so long your hands have turned to diamonds.

To all my brothers,

See you on the moon.

My background is IT as a job and using digital currency on exchanges for trading to earn money. I also mine, and stake.  So moving over to a traditional exchange wasn't to hard for simple trades. I'm learning options and spreads slowly without taking to much risk. I'm really liking doing traditional trading.

7 years ago I cashed out my IRAs and 401k went all in on digital currency and never looked back and made a money making hobby out of it.

Now you know my background, I hope that will help you help me.

I'm currently using Robinhood for trading and options. Of course using other research tools to make the right moves. It's a little easier than trading digital currency because, well it's tangible or retail and speculating it's a little easier. It's all numbers, digital is mostly by mumbles and whales. Ok I'm getting off track.

Ok, on the 10th Roblox is having it's IPO. I've never dealt with an IPO. In digital I've always stayed away from ICOs, because if you know anything about ICOs they are mostly scams or blow-up and go away.

I think Roblox will be good for long. My son is way into it and even helps develope a couple of games. I've seen the platform and what it can do and how well it helps developers monetize their games. Ok ok I'm getting off track again.

So what can I expect from the IPO?
I assume it starts at bell? 
How is it speculated share cost?
Should I stick with Robinhood or move to a better more advanced platform for this and the future?
Will this or other IPOs get crazy fast? I would think so.

 I think they are only offering 199 million in stock, but I see no mention of quantity of shares.

This will prepare me for when Skylink IPO.

TIA

I found WSB last year and although I‚Äôve been a lurker, I‚Äôve been inspired to get into the stock market and learn as much as I can while not working so I can stay afloat.

54,m0wfke,"Alright buckle up retards today we're going to answer a question that has managed to elude retards and algorithmic options traders who use Robinhood to exploit their free option trades for years.

Why the fuck is option order routing so bad? It always seems like I'm the last order to fill.

Well let me answer your question with another question What happens after you submit an order on Robinhood?

That we do know the answer to, and we shall go through it very quickly. Robinhood has their own order router, this does all the ""paperwork"" a trade needs for it to be able to be processed by a Market Maker, or by the execution venue.

So firstly, your order is sent to the RH order router, this first checks basic stuff, dividend risk, collateral req. checks, avail; funds checks, margin checks, and a PCO(position closing only) check. If any of that returns a false argument, the order is kicked back. If that's all good, the order is flashed onto the PFOF desk at Citadel Securities, they pay top dollar for the sweet, sweet dumb money pfof, that they will always adjust their books so that RH's order router routes to them first. Now Citadel has a set time to do with this order(because the exchanged price is still changing and of course its not public which is fucking fair right?). They can one: if the limit order on the marketbale option order is theo(theoretical price) + edge(which is hidden information due to game theory reasons), then the MM will fill you.

This can and does lead to something called price improvement. For example if the 69c for $ASS is trading at a spread of 0.69-0.86, with a theo of 0.74, the MM takes a 0.04 edge on the position, so any order above 0.78 will fill, which is technically better than paying 0.86 at the ask.

The problem with this however, is the rights to your order. Customer orders are supposed to have priority over MM orders on marketable option and equity tickers, BUT, MMs and Citadel rather take your order ""hostage"" with their own order placed on your behalf with flags set on the trade that a retail customer cannot set on their order.

I've been trading GOOGL intraday calls and puts, and discovered that orders that I was competing against would fill before me, even though I was supposedly the first one on the books(read exchange) on that price. So what? you might say, ""you got unlucky"", no I, you, or anyone else getting buttfucked by Robinhood is not ""unlucky"". The vast, vast majority of option and equity exchanges operate on FIFO w/contingencies. FIFO(First in First Out) means the first person to put up their sell, and first person who put up the bid side will be matched with each other, there is no luck to who gets an order, it who put in that order first. Now ""w/contingencies"" is supposed to be in the retail traders benefit, because that states that, even if a MM places an order before a customer, the customer will still be first. But clearly if you ever traded options on Robinhood, you'd realize **that's not the fucking case.**

So what the heck is goin' on?

I've done many hours of research to come to this conclusion, but all it is my best educated guess, with my knowledge of option order routing. Nothing about how Citadel routes orders, their edge threshold or how much time they hold the orders before moving it somewhere else(read different MM) is all private due to game theory reasons.

I am going to assume that once your order hits Citadels PFOF screens, and they don't want to fill your order at the current price. They will fire an identical order on their end, to the exchange, on your behalf(while nullifying the original order), this removes the CUST order specification, and allows them to get you the worst possible fill, while still giving you the BBO. Certain MM flags exist that actually allow last priority of an order, and it's very possible that they place that on your order. This will 100% of the time have your order be the last one on the books before the bid or ask changes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Last Priority MM Order Flag](https://preview.redd.it/ysbb0tefuwl61.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f82c2b29ec8bf7adb389dbe488748e4f25996b4c)

Why would they do this?

They edge themselves by positioning themselves a certain against your executed trade. You getting a shitty fill is Citadel getting an awesome fill. And that is vice versa, you getting an excellent fill is not as good(or shitty) for Citadel, or the MM who picks up your marketable option order. So Citadel wants good fills, and a good edge, so they have to fuck someone over to get that.

What can I do about it?

On other(read real) brokers, you can have your orders sent directly to your desired exchange, without sending directly to a market maker(a market maker can still fill the order on-the-screens), however your order will still have that holy CUST order specification. On Robinhood, there is nothing they can do unless they add execution options and options for specific order instructions, which they won't do.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - When buying options, Citadel likely puts your order on the screens on your behalf(instead of your original order from the app), doing this loses the CUST order specification, which gives your order priority over MMs, and customers trading on brokerages that can shoot orders directly on the exchange will have priority over you. That is the most probable reason as to why Robinhood's order routing is trash.

It was obvious to me that the Fed would withhold bond purchases so they would be able to purchase the $2T of stimulus bonds. And, I've profited.

At the time, everyone here was pushing GME ‚Äì nice work BTW ‚Äì¬†but come on! This would have been an OBVIOUS trade had memes &amp; discussion like this not been suppressed.

Turns out Papa Elon is making a 100MW battery center down the road from me. Idk what this means as far as the stock is concerned but the fact that he is down here shows he is honestly serious about moving into the energy sector as a true competitor. This is Dow‚Äôs back yard, literally their main offices are a 10 minute drive away in the next town over (Lake Jackson). We sit at an important location for the flow of energy in the state of Texas (and surrounding states as this area sells a tooooon of excess power) and Musk putting a center here is no accident.
