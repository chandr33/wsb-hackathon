\*\*SUMMARY: A conservative valuation of Molson-Coors reveals a potential appreciation of 38.57%, indicating that the stock is currently oversold and has room for appreciation. Target value between 57.06 (\*\****book-value/share)*** **and 62.38 (*****forecasted value)*****. With this target, I predict a variable appreciation between 26.74% to 38.57%.**

Summary Valuation

Methodology

\*Citations will be marked \[content\]\**EP* \*for materials in Earnings Presentation (EP), and \[content\]\**ECT* *for materials in Q4 Earnings Call Transcript.*

**REVENUE-EMERGING**

Take note of significant investments in revenue generation in emerging growth areas, including product lines ZOA, La Colombe, LA Libations, and Truss; of these, guidance forecasts $1 Billion revenue generation combined by 2023EP. Along with the capacity of manufacturing appx. 750m sleek cans, there is room for careful optimism in assessing future segments. Management states "" It will be a driving force behind our goal to build our emerging growth division into a $1 billion revenue business by 2023.""ECT

With this in mind, I put forward an upwards bias for revenue forecasts, including the effect of CBD-drinks in Canada, and their eventual legalization and spread into the US Market.

**REVENUE-ESTABLISHED**

Note continued market share growth despite coronavirus, with miller lite (disgusting) up +8.6%EP, and Coors Light (pisswater) up +6.1%EP both purely off-premise sales. With reopening likely, we can expect a sales normalization from Q3FY21 to Q2 FY22, where we can reach parity with 17-19 figures. Molson also doubled the US market share in Hard SeltzerEP and double-digit growth (17%) in regional crafts.ECT

With regards to tech-sales, TAP experienced a 230% increase in eCommerce sales in the US Market.ECT

**REVENUE-CONCLUSION**

With this information in mind, the company issues guidance for mid-single-digit sales revenue growth. Factoring pent-up demand from closing, we incorporate a higher-than-guidance growth of 5.5% for FY21. As full immunity is reached by late 2021-early 2022, as well as dedicated growth in marketing spending, revenue growth will spike to 9.5% throughout FY22 and FY23, before slowly trending downward towards 7.5% growth by FY26.

Incorporating analysis of their production line expansion, COGS will likely trend down from 60.97% of revenue this year, to 56.55% by FY26, choreographing a yearly 74 bps improvement in profit margins.

&amp;#x200B;

Top Line and CAGR

**Expenditures and Strategy**

Focusing on management remarks, the increased marketing spending(ECT) will go SG&amp;A, not only with an FY21 normalization to pre-covid levels but also sustained increases throughout FY23. Averaging 11.50% growth in SG&amp;A expenses, this will trend down towards 5.5% in FY26. As a % of Revenue metric, SG&amp;A expenses will peak through FY23-24 toward 27.48%, before moving towards a low-end historical share of 26.67%.

Similarly, throw out all extra, unusual, and abnormal items before applying a high-end tax estimate(ECT) of 23% throughout the forecasting period.

Therefore, while Gross Profit will grow at a CAGR of 9.36%, Operating Income will grow at 12.14%, reflecting margin improvements as revenues trend upward. Net Income will increase at a similar rate, but with a lower denominator, have a CAGR of 14.64%

&amp;#x200B;

MidLine Summary

**EPS and Dividends**

Including the prospect of stock repurchases, expect diluted shares to decrease by 50 bps every year incrementally. Adj. Diluted EPS excluding extras, unusual, and abnormalities will be used in order to accurately reflect the operating health of the company, sans any M&amp;A targets (which are unlikely considering the financing environment).

As the situation normalizes, I expect the company to be cautious with regards to dividends in FY21, before increasing to $1.64/share dividends in FY22. There will likely be no increases, as more spending will be needed for market share expansion.

EPS and Div

**Key Predictions**

Revenue to normalize by 2022, beat 17-19 performance by FY23.

Profit to normalize by 2022, beat 17-19 performance by FY23.

Operating Income to normalize by 2023, will not beat until FY24.

Net Income to normalize by 2024, will not beat until FY25.

EPS will normalize by 2022, beat FY17 performance by FY23.

**Methodology Summary:**

The method used is the EPS\*coefficient valuation method from ""Security Analysis"" by Grahm/Dodd, with a 6-year horizon and earnings extrapolation. The Forward P/E ratio used is 12, roughly higher than the current 11.25 and 11.78 of FY20.

There are a ton of great possibilities happening like Amazon buying one or both. GME and AMC could potentially merge together. DFV and retail investors support. I'm even fascinated by the idea of having private movie screenings or video game tournaments held by GME and happening in an AMC theater. Theres the business aspect also of Ryan Cohen becoming I believe...trillionaire . 69420 sounds really great also per share (now it's talk about 100k-1m per share for GME) why is AMC not worth more? It should be at least 10k per share. This is a once in a life time opportunity. Not sure if apes agree with me, but all the DD, discussions, business aspects etc point to AMC being valued much higher.

99,lwb79l,"hey, what do you guys use to generate reports, for, say top five day gainers? I found one on barcharts which was pretty good, but I would like to see the MARKET CAP for each company on the report. So, can anyone recommend a good analysis tool like this, where columns are somewhat customizable? (like I said, report with real time data but can add a column for each result in the report). thanks.",generate customizable report?,1.0,1614715552,soulful_xmas
