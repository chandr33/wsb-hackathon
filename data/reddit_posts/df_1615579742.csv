You’ve noticed **GME hasn’t moved much recently**, and that’s because there are a lot of call options that have been sold and will expire worthless at EOD if the stock price is below the strike price. That’s bad for us. 

**We could turn this into a bit move though.**

There are A LOT of contracts between $250-300. Institutional money will do everything it can to keep GME below that number. Here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/ywcXldc) of call options sold today. 

The thing is, if we can get it above $300 today at close, all these contracts will expire IN THE MONEY...and yes, they will have to buy up 100 shares of GME for every contract. And if they’re covered, they will have to sell the shares they are in control of, giving us more leverage and control of more shares. 

For example, just today, there are about 40,000 call options sold between strike price $260-300. 

**So if those close ITM, that’s an extra FOUR MILLION shares of GME that move in our direction.**

So, it’s time, right now. Load up all the extra dry powder to got to push this thing past $300 and keep it there today. 

If you currently own call options ITM you could also exercise them to have the same effect. It’s an important move today that will help us with the bigger squeeze squozing.

24,m3q2ew,"This is not political. Idc about Biden, Trump, Obama, Reagan, or whoever caused this massive bubble when it comes to making money.

TLDR; If you’re a student, invest in subsidized student loans for the chance that student debt forgiveness is passed during the Biden administration.

Student loans are currently at an all time high at $1.5 trillion in student debt and continuing to rise, but I’m sure most of you retards know that with how much debt you’ve taken on to satisfy your gambling addictions, you bunch of degenerates. But I’m sure some of you are still in school and considering taking out student loans. All I have to say is NOW IS THE BEST TIME! Invest in yourself and invest in your bank account. 

Now I know loans don’t really work like stocks do, but for the sake of this post I will treat them as such. Normally when a stock is over leveraged like this, one side declares bankruptcy and covers their debt, but in this case, the government has made it impossible to default on student loans. This has caused the financial industry to bet on academics with no exposure since it’s impossible to default. It also led to the insane increase in price for a college degree, leading to more debt or larger bets on students.  Government’s involvement is likely what caused this trillion dollar bubble, but it’s possible they’ll be the ones to pop it in the near future.

Biden promised to forgive up to $50,000 in student loan debt for every American, but has since lowered it to $10,000 since elected. If you are a student you have the chance to turn the tables on student loans. If you take out $10,000 in subsidized student loans, you will not accrue interest on it until 6 months after you graduate. For freshmen this means you will be able to hold onto this money through the Biden administration. 

If Biden eventually passes it, you have essentially bought put options on your education and exercised them in the money by holding. If it never gets passed, you don’t accrue interest, and you can return the money in full 6 months after graduation. It’s a risk free bet just like the financial industry has done to students forever.

Also I’m not sure if this is entirely legal, seems like a gray area. If you’re actually a student with the required hours to receive financial aid, I don’t see how it could be illegal.

Market Insider wrote a report citing a Bank of America survey that found that the majority of the upcoming $1400 stimulus check payments will go towards savings and investing, with only 36% saying they would be spending the money on necessities.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stimulus-checks-upcoming-1400-go-towards-savings-bofa-survey-2021-3-1030170204](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stimulus-checks-upcoming-1400-go-towards-savings-bofa-survey-2021-3-1030170204)

Don't read that article, it's too long and full of words.

Here's a picture from that article with powerful colors:

[ur wifes boyfriend has that large throbbing top bar](https://preview.redd.it/w6srsa1kknm61.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5aa9e8dd5bc2880a2014231130b87b7da3efd33)

*So why'd you include words if you don't want monkey read?* That's simple. I wanted to trick you, the dumb ape, into thinking I, a dumb ape, was a smart ape. Also it gave me the chance to make that fun joke about you being a ""lowest-income earner"" which I certainly enjoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what does this mean for me and the stock market?

It's simple. The first thing you need to do is break down the math... which I know can be hard. So I've done the leg work for you. I googled ""impossible math formula"" and I'll show you the top result of that now:

[scary right?](https://preview.redd.it/ugzfk2u3mnm61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a8ac6425b1875cd569c4ca2ca17779d6e8828fa)

If you work through that equation you'll find that for every $1 invested in the stock market there is 10\^2 cents invested. 

This is what's known as the 1:1 ratio. 

*Will this make me rich with tendies?* Possibly, you just have to figure out how to apply that logic to something that makes money.

# Is this investment advice?

93,m3qd16,"SWN: it hit $4.20 March 10th, and was $48 in Dec. 2009.  

This is both a fundamentals and explosive growth play.  

They produce natural gas; this is rapidly replacing coal and both temporarily satisfies the green crowd for its relative clean burning, and is actually the most cost effective RELIABLE energy source.  Solar and Wind combined with batteries cannot replace it with current technology, if that were to even occur its 10+ years out.  NG is how we get the electricity to power Teslas, NIOS, and other EVs, along with our homes.  If you think electricity generation demand is decreasing, you would be wrong.  It is actually increasing substantially, even without taking into account the EV market growth.  Look at Texas; when they had some frozen generators and wind due to lack of winterization, some people got energy bills for $17k to due disparity in demand/supply.  Imagine that shit.

SWN has no maturities until 2025 and proven positive free cash flow with proved reserves of 15 tcf and a total enterprise value of $5.5 Billion, which is only about 40 cents per mcf which translates to $2.40 per barrel of oil equivalent.  

It has been destroyed over the last 4 years by Wall Street shorts and all nat gas producers have been savaged by the Wall Street analysts for Morgan Stanley, etc. but especially Morgan Stanley (Names the boomers trust).

Nat. gas has been in a bear market since 2008, but with the destruction of the space last year there has been a collapse in drilling and there isn't even oil drilling which used to bring associated nat. gas with it as a by-product.  Gas demand is still surging both as a power plant fuel replacing coal and export of liquid natural gas (LNG) to places like China where it has been cold as shit.

Nat. gas was recently going for $30 per mcf in China LNG market while trading at $2.75 here.  This price difference cannot go on forever.  

Printing money just adds fuel to the fire, we know the fed will keep pumping money look at the 2T stimmys.  Inflation is like magic for NG, so it's also a hedge on that scenario when the overall market will underperform in hyper-inflation.  SWN would fly in that scenario.     

Buying a producer with massive reserves is better than buying Nat. Gas futures because there is no time limit.  You can HOLD until you are right.  Which you have to be eventually. 

Pure NG producers have trippled in 10 months so far, and are still dirt cheap.  This is a serious 10X play. SWN has already quadrupled from its low in March.

EVs and the economy going EV does not affect natural gas, it ADDS to it.. . It is the fuel for the electricity that will ever increasingly drive our economy.  The only threats to NG are widespread adoption of batteries for powering ENTIRE CITIES using renewables/Nuclear.  This is at least decades off, if even viable.  Bill Gates, the largest green energy investor in the world, only sees Nuclear as being economically viable long term and batteries being completely unviable for power grids due to their relatively short life-cycle and low capacity (even future projected capacity).  One guys opinion, but the energy space is speculative and full of political back and forth.  In the end, investment in renewable is low because the return is FAR out, and that is the fact of current offerings that compare to NG.  NG is here for decades as the main power source for the world economy as it shifts from coal, because Nuclear is too onerous, expensive, and ""scary"" to default to.

imo, Natural Gas is the speculative energy play for our generation.  It will explode as electricity demand increases and U.S. oil drilling dies off (from govt. policies or just supply/demand drop, competition with opec, etc.)

I started at SolarCity in 2015 as a roof-mounted solar installer. I was a highschool dropout with no future. I wageslaved for years and sacrificed my social life to climb the corporate ladder, until we were acquired by TSLA. I had been promoted 3 times by the end of 2016.

I transferred to the Engineering &amp; Design department at Tesla. I became a PV Designer II. I designed solar systems, Powerwall battery storage systems, solarglass roof systems, and even attended installations to audit how the new products were doing in the field. They gave me recognition for my speed and quality many times. All without a fucking degree or even a *diploma.*

My intention was to hold those employee restricted stock units and stay with the company forever. Drank the Kool-aid for years. *I liked the stock.*

They laid me off in January 2019. Seven percent of the company was downsized. The TSLA shares were executed at &lt; $400 prices. **I missed out on the +488% rush that happened in the following year. All of my former Tesla coworkers have houses.** I wasn't even left bags to hold. I busted my ass and cried myself to sleep for nothing. I worked my way up through merit alone, and a little is all it took to lose everything.

Fast forward to now: I've since been diagnosed with bipolar, OCD and ADHD. I've been through five jobs since TSLA. I have -$25k in debt, no career, no equity, and no future. My car has 100,000 miles. What little family I have left lives far, far away. My meds keep me asleep most days. I live off Doordash. I have hit bottom and kept digging.

Today I liquidated the last of my set-and-forget positions. I will ""Mr. Bean"" my way out of debt the exact way I goofed my way into an engineering career. Pure, unadulterated stubbornness.

**TL;DR:** **It's all GME now. Why?** ***I like the stock.***","Fellow autists, please hear me.",1.0,1615580992,golevka6489
97,m3qeaz,"Picture this: Old ass hedge fund investors and old boomer traders, you take their thoughts, prayers, soul, and bodily remains. You press it all down and turn it into a lump of coal. A massive fucking lump of coal. You take that coal, and over the past few months of the GME madness, it has been perfected into the most beautiful diamond rock. You polish the shit out of that resulting in a gorgeous diamond. You take that diamond and infuse it into my palm to the point of sheer pain. That pain, the blood be the sweat from that has all formed the most perfect diamond hand you have ever seen. Pristine conditions, polished to a T, and all around symmetrical. Here you have one diamond hand. Do that over and over again for ever ape and you have an army of diamond handed apes. We are among that army and will keep this going until they fold like puny and fragile twig.
