Hello fellow apes,

Been ruminating about creating this post for a while but thought it would be a good one to share with you wonderful r-tards before our rocket flies to Alpha Centauri.

So we are all patiently waiting for our well-earned tendies to come our way now. For many of us, this will most likely be the most money we have ever had, which is fantastic. I for one can't wait to see this massive wealth transfer happen.

Obligatory ""I am not a financial advisor, this is based on my own experience, knowledge etc"". I work with cash rich investors and find them property investment opportunities so I have HAD to learn about money and investments.

I would caution everyone here a few things when you have your dragon's hoard of tendies:

* **Take a deep breath.**

And resist the immediate urges that come with the notion of having a lot of money. Now read the rest of this post you smooth-brained ape.

* **Remember you might have to pay tax on this money.**

Chances are, you will have to pay tax on your earnings. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ASIDE MONEY FOR THIS. And speak to an accountant if you are unsure about any of this.

* **Don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know.**

Some people changes when it comes to money. The more people you tell, the more random friends you haven't talked to in years will come your way. Hell, even family members might come to you and start asking for monetary favours and chances are you will start running relationships into the ground because of it. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

* **Put money aside as saving to tide you over for 3-6 months.**

I don't care that you have a shit-ton of money. What are your living costs? Now make sure you have 3-6 months of that stashed for rainy days (hopefully we won't have any of those).

* **Re-invest most of your money.**

Seriously. Don't withdraw all of it and for fuck's sake do not let all that money sit in a bank. They are currently considering negative interest rates here in the UK, and currently interest rates sit at about 0.01% FUCK ALL. Re-invest it! There are a shit-zillion ways you can do that and I guarantee you all of them will be better than sticking it all in a bank account. I love property! 10-15% returns in the UK, easy peasy. Maybe that's your thing, maybe it isn't.

Also consider this, if you hold a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you are LIMITED to only put in ¬£20K per financial year. HOWEVER, all the GAINS you make in that account are free to use AND you don't pay taxes on withdrawals. If you took it all out however you would be limited by the 20K. So maybe you re-invest it in other stocks you like?

Maybe you stick it in a Lifetime-savers account where you benefit from compound interest (if you don't know how powerful this is, look it up!) You could be a millionaire in 30 years by just putting in a couple of thousand every year.

* **Do not upgrade your lifestyle (too much).**

Okay so you want your Lambo, I understand. We all do. We've been living off pot-noodles and crushed up paracetamol for so long now.

Did you know that ONE THIRD of lottery winners usually declare bankruptcy within three to five years? Do you have any idea how many professional athletes go BROKE? (Spoiler, it's a lot).

Why? Because these people have little-to-no financial education. We aren't taught this stuff in school. No one is going to take you hand, you have to teach yourself this stuff.

One of the biggest mistakes people who aren't used to money make, is to immediately buy a massive house, buy gifts for friends &amp; family, buy expensive cars, start hiring staff and so forth. See where I'm getting at?

Ask yourself, do you really need all these luxury goods? Absolutely treat yourself, but understand it can be a VERY slippery slope that you might not be able to sustain. Which is why it is so important to have ASSETS (see point above). That shit will pay you back. Your Lambos and gifts for friends &amp; family, however nice, won't.

* **Treat yourself!**

Read everything above? Good. You can treat yourself now. Otherwise, what's the point? Get that Lambo, you deserve it. After all, you've got money stashed now and you've put most of it into investments that will pay you back and keep you living the sweet life of never having to work again.

That's all for now folks.

Once again, this is NOT financial advice. Do your own research etc. Just be careful with them tendies.

IF you read my first DD and got in, congrats.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the\_rkt\_is\_fueled\_and\_ready\_for\_liftoff\_launches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/)

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

\[LINK 1\] \~ A Link to the RKT IR website, announcing that Jay Farner, the CEO is going on a call with Morgan Stanley during a Tech conference they're having tomorrow at 10:15.

&amp;#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert &amp; Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

\[LINK 2\]

&amp;#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&amp;#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45. 

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&amp;#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&amp;#x200B;

My PT is $73.5. NO üßªüëê

Not financial advice. I don't know anything.

Positions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.

AMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives. 

Now over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \[steadily\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.

Early last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low. 

So to sum up why it was low last year.

&amp;#x200B;

* Streaming services being used more
* Cinemas closed due to Covid.
* No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]
* Bankruptcy possibility
* Free reign hedge fund short selling 
* No one buying the stock

# Now this year is different

We all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.

# Overvalued or Undervalued?

For the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.

&amp;#x200B;

* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for person use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.
* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.
* ~~No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson &amp; Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.
* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.
* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \[if not most\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.
* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back no by hedge funds.

Now I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.

# Now Lets Talk About March

[\[ironically except last year due to Covid closures lol\]](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)

&amp;#x200B;

* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.

&amp;#x200B;

* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares

&amp;#x200B;

# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.

A lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different. 

&amp;#x200B;

* March 5th \[this Friday\] theaters will reopen in NY \[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)

&amp;#x200B;

* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \[my belief it is\] this will drive the price up farther.

*Processing img ecj12fvpjpk61...*

* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)

Not only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)

*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating about the Amazon buy but it is entirely possible AMC would come up with some thing for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*

* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \[March 5th\] to Short interest report \[March 9th\] and Earning report \[March 10th after hours into 11th\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.

If we do this, hedge funds will have no source of making money and CANNOT play the waiting game with us to COVER and we will ultimately reach $2,000 for GME &amp; $1,000 AMC if not more faster that you think. 

If we succeed in doing so, we will get rid of hedge funds for good and retailers will be in control.
