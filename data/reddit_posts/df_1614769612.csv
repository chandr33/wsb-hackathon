It's 6 30 A.M., AMC up 1% already in premarket setting up for a good day.I wonder what the FOOL will put out in their daily slam press release.

It's funny that in the Washington hearings they talked about the social media on redit running up the shares prices, but failed to discus the shorters tools like The Motley FOOL putting out bogus negative press releases daily and even several times a day when the stock is railying in a deliberate effort to scare investors from buying and to induce selling to make the short sellers the represent money at investors expense.

This company will benifit from the reopening sas people are dying to get out and going out to the Movies the most popular entertainment .It is actualy more popular than going to a NFL game.2019 moview ticket sales were 1,228,763,382 compared to the NFL ticket sales of 16.670,000.That is why the averafe ticket price has gone up every year for the past 30 years until Covid.
