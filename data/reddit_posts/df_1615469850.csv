So, I started learning about algorithmic trading (because I'm a data scientist who loves machine learning, so applying that stuff to the markets seems interesting), and this morning I came across a section in this textbook from '07 that brought tears to my hairy ape eyes...look how wonderfully reminiscent this is of our current situation. If only Shitadel &amp; Friends had read this book, maybe they wouldn't be holding short positions on GME for months on end despite clear signs that their tactic is about to fucking implode. 

**TLDR:** there are some unwritten rules that you shouldn't hold a short position for too long or you risk getting majorly fucked. The HFs on the wrong side of this war ignored that unwritten rule and are facing the consequences.

**TLDR (even simpler):** HFs take big risk, about to lose many tendies

Over the past week I've been thinking at which point I'm gonna sell, at times thinking to myself 10k, maybe even less just to be safe and take easy profits, all while calling myself ""diamond hands"" thinking that's the peak. 

But fear not! I am no longer a fraud and have since invested even more while also smoothing out the wrinkles in my brain and and unleashed the retard ape within me 🦍🦍🦍🦍

 However what I realize is that if I thought this, there's bound to be more shitheads out there with the same mindset. I know this has been said countless times but this is the opportunity of a lifetime. For all those that paperhand at 1k, 10k , 20k, fuck you. You may make enough money to be happy for a year, some of you may never even even have to work another day in your life, but if you ride this shit out, ALL of us will be set, you, your children, even your grandchildren. If you fucking paperhand you're doing exactly what the hedgies want, all you're doing is sucking on the balls of the people who fucked us in 08, the more you hold the more we are tugging the balls right out those cunts until they're left with nothing but pennies to their name and saggy lump of skin between their legs. 

You can be a bitch and paper hand this 4 or 5 digits, or you can stick to your word and ride this shit to the moon 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

42,m2qgwo,"Alright folks I've had this sitting in my mind for a bit and wanted to get it out there.

Let's start with disclosures:
* Position:  17 GME @ 148 avg.   Not a life changing amount, so take that how you want.
* I am not:
  * A financial advisor
  * You mother OR father
  * A cat
  * Your wife or her boyfriend
* **This.  Is.  Not.  Financial.  Advice.**

Okay this could get long.   **TLDR:  IF YOU WIN BIG DO NOT REINVEST IT INTO THE MARKET PLEASE.  BE BETTER THAN THE HFs.**

Okay that either piqued your interest or made you think ""fuck off"".  For those who stuck around let me explain this.

GME is, for lack of a better term, a Black Swan event (google it).  We have been comparing it to the VW squeeze, but that's not entirely accurate for one main reason:  The VW squeeze was planned, engineered, and executed over the course of **3 years** by **experienced professionals** in the main company (Porsche) that gained billions from it.  Did other people make money along the way?  Sure.  But they didn't cause shit.  The GME squeeze can arguably be stated as **caused by retail investors**. 

I know what some of you are thinking now:  ""Retail doesn't own shit compared to the whales that are helping out and making money too"".   True.  Absolutely.  But this entire event was catalyzed and is perpetuated by retail investors.  We are the focus of this.  We are the people talking about it, and bringing it to light.  We are, possibly, even the ones who will get **blamed** for this in the end.

So then let me get back to my main point,  **""Why the fuck shouldn't I reinvest my winnings?!""** Here's my thought on that:

If (**IF, not WHEN**) this squeeze happens, it could be massive.  It is shaping up to blow the January squeeze out of the water, and if all goes perfectly, maybe even blow the VW squeeze out of the water.  The common phrase being tossed around here is ""the single greatest wealth transfer between the rich and the poor ever"".   That may be true, it may not.  I'm not a fuckin' mathemetician.   But even if it isn't, it will still be HUGE.  That there is the key point of this rambling BS I'm typing.   I'll put this in big simple terms:

**IF YOU WIN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT THE CASINO AND BEAT THE ODDS, THEN TURN AROUND AND PUT THAT MONEY ON 42-BLACK, THE CASINO HAS BEATEN YOU.**

Hedge funds will still exist after this is done.  **Evil** hedge funds will still exist after this is done.   **Melvin and Citadel** might still exists even after this is done.  **They are not going to stop doing the exact shit we are uncovering.**  If you make a life-changing amount of money with the GME squeeze, and turn around and start buying options on meme stocks and shit again, then all of that money you won will go STRAIGHT BACK into the pocket of the HFs.  They are the casino.  They are the house.  They will ALWAYS win.  

Treat this money as lottery winnings, because that's what it is, because this is a casino out back behind a Wendy's.

Take that money that you EARNED by BEATING THE SYSTEM, and change your life with it.  Change other peoples' lives.  Donate to charity, pay off debts for people you love.  Do GOOD with that money, because if you put it back in the market, that money will go right back to the HFs, and we already know that **nothing good is done with that money**.

If you made it to the end, congrats.  Somehow you can read but are still on this sub.

Our captain is called DeepFuckingValue and here with me are other members of the flight crew HeyItsPixel and Possibly6.

Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to direct your attention to me for this moment.  We will be showing our safety demonstration and would like the next few minutes of your complete attention.

Above your heads you can find the oxygen masks which may be activated during the flight, those might come handy once you start to lose your breath from the amount of tendies heading your way. There are several emergency stoplosses - here, here and here. All of them are disabled during this flight. A life vest is located in a pouch under your seat or between the armrests. When instructed to do so, open the plastic pouch and remove the vest, you can then throw it away as you won't be needing one. Sudden losses of altitude may occur during this flight and I would like to assure you that those are perfectly normal behaviours during these gamma flights. During takeoff, all your portable electronic devices must be set to BUY mode in your broker application until an announcement is made upon arrival to the stratosphere.

In a few minutes, the flight attendants will be passing around the cabin to offer you hot or cold drinks, as well as crayons for breakfast. Only green and red color crayons are available.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the Fasten Seat Belt sign, we are ready for take-off.

Thank you for your attention and enjoy your flight.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's been a rough past few weeks since I did this original DD. I added more shares to cost average down further during the rough ride last week. We pumped yesterday on some good news about new services related to birthdays. 

&amp;#x200B;

My convictions about the stock haven't changed. What has changed is the current short interest. As of 2/26 (according to nasdaq) the short count was \~ 6 million shares, with approximately  28 million  shares floating. At the current daily volume of \~1 million shares, it would take short positions approximately 6 days to cover. That's six days to really fucked up some hedgies. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Nasdaq last reported short float](https://preview.redd.it/6zh5j02flem61.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496cb6059e07d0448cc626d3cc3acc9f6580f195)

According to some of the modeling available online (which can be WRONG!) the short interest has increased into the 40% range, which would mean about 10 million shorted shares shorted with the same float. I will wait for the Nasdaq data publication that comes tomorrow to confirm/deny this modeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still believe in this stock, and imagine that the April earnings catalyst will put us in the high 30s/low 40s. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always, my positions:

47,m2qi2f,"I'm going to try to keep this fairly short and simple as that is what I like to read in other DD posts and not a case file, even though props to that hardcore DD.

Over the past 6 weeks tech and growth have been slammed while ""value stocks"" like oil financials etc. have rallied. Congrats to those who made tendies off of that ride. I caught the tail end of it.

Now that the 10 year bond is yielding below 1.485, CNBC has finally given up on the fear mongering. I began looking at the short interest in 2 names in particular, AAPL and QQQ. Both of these names saw an increase in short interest to their highest levels in recent times. Essentially , because of their weighting, the yield story comes out and the 2 largest holdings in tech are shorted to the extreme bringing down the entire industry including ARKK etc.

Tuesday we saw a sharp rally to a major pivot point with the QQQ holding above $310. Yesterday this line was held and gave confirmation of a reversal. Today we see the breakout. I have every cent I own spread out amongst Q names. The DIA and SP have done great with the DIA seeing ATH. They will continue to perform but Tech and Growth are where you want to be til June IMO. If the shorts in the sector begin to cover, watch out.

My major holdings:

TQQQ

QQQ

LULU - Reports March 24th and a major growth name in the Q

AAPL

AMD - 2nd most shorted stock in dollar value next to Tesla

All these names have major runway and should perform well throughout the 2nd Qt. Inflation, Bond yields, ""economy crash"", stimmy checks. Everything is good news. Time to play the underperformers.

73,m2qmzv,"This is a poem about my favorite stock, GME

I’ve been there in the good and the bad, you see

It all started a few months ago

When the hedges did a bit too much blow


GameStock they said, was going to plummet

It’s dying retail, it’ll never reach the summit

But little did they know, there was not a cat in town

Who noticed the antics of these hedgie clowns


But the dip he said from $4 to $2

It was dismal it seemed, the buying was through

But then all of a sudden Ryan Cohen hopped aboard

He bought into the stock, this could not be ignored!


People realized the value of this great stock

The price skyrocketed, the hedge funds in shock

But then the hedgies thought, we cannot let this be

Retail traders beating us, were losing our money tree


So the hedgies decided they would take a stand

Against “dumb money” (that’s us) and the WSB brand

They gave millions to officials, news outlets and more

To spread the story that GME would make everyone poor


Their FUD wasn’t working, billions down the drain

They decided to restrict trading to stop the retail gain

No more shares could be bought, you could only sell

The problem is, we didn’t hear no bell


As the stock dropped to $40 I sank to my knees

The market was rigged, and I didn’t have the keys

They change the rules when they want

As the Steven cohens of the world, sir and taunt


The paper hands started screaming, we told you so!

In disbelief I saw my statement number, -90% and below.

But then I realized a small and true fact 

That I could actually survive these attacks


It wasn’t a loss until I actually sold

So I did something others might have called bold

I doubled down on my shares and lowered my cost

As the price continued to decrease all seemed to be lost


Then a glimmer of light started to shine through

The headbanded investor bought more for me and for you

This catalyst was all that the stock seemed to need

As we shot back up and hedgies again started to bleed


The price hit $380 then fell to the ground

$198 the chart said, many were dumbfound

The price jumped back up quick and went back to even

I doubled my resolve, this is a stock to believe in


And now we have made it to today

Who’s side are you on and with what do you play

Make a choice, hold or buy if you can

Just make sure going in you have your own plan


GameStop to the moon, yet again it seems

It can stay our rocket, just through all the great memes

To the moon we go, keep us in your prayers

90,m2qpvu,"I don't want to add fuel to the blind hypee fire during a time where *practical* information is sensitive and on higher demand. But I found this article interesting as it (casually) tries to analyze a surge effect based off short interest vs. gamma swarming.

I think the main point was making a case for possible organic market movements versus artificial, hedge fund-like, leveraging. At least during this awkward stage of the economy.

93,m2qr9k," **Good morning, here's some stocks to watch today:**

**Gap Ups:** AMWL, AVEO, BA, BILI, BMBL, CHWY, DKNG, DM, FSLY, FSR, GNOG, JD, JKS, JMIA, LAZR, PLUG, RBLX, RIOT, RSI, SPR, STPK, U, UAL, VIR, XPEV

**Gap Downs:** ORCL

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY gapping up again pre market after breaking back over it's moving averages, short and long term.

**Notes:** If you have any questions, message me or shoot me an email. Lots of movement pre market but many charts still not the best for day trading as short term moving averages are in the way. Still a few decent charts. If you like small caps this week has been great, if you don't not so much. Gambling stocks, energy, aluminum and shipping stocks made decent moves yesterday, we may get some continuation today. Most likely choppy action for the rest of the week as the SPY and IWM are reaching highs and the QQQ is still under major moving averages. My plan is to be cautious, and take solid setups. I'll be more aggressive once I see decent movement in stocks. Good luck out there.

\**I do not add stocks under $5.  If there is a stock that is under $5 here then it was above $5 when I added it*\*","Game Plan for March 11, 2021",0.75,1615471484,Kant_sleep13
