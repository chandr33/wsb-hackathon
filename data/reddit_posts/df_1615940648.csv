9,m6nmto,"TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich

I know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of AMC that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. AMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. Hating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single ""retail investor"" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win/squeeze, the entire economy/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen. Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. To me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. So support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME. Ape together strong, but more importantly, Common people together, supporting each other, can change the entire world.",Give me a chance please,1.0,1615940887,x5FDPxReaper94

15,m6non9,"All,

I don‚Äôt know any of y‚Äôall besides through the various subs that make it to the top of my page each time I log in. Full disclosure, I own a few thousand shares of AMC and 1 share of GME (for the cause). When I first heard of wallstreetbets I was just another guy trying to make a quick buck and learned a good hard lesson. I was quick to pull the trigger on multiple meme stocks only to see and hear of RH and the hedgies screwing everyone over. Anyways, I took my losses on the chin but decided to remain in AMC and continued to hold my 1 share of GME because it felt like I was a part of something. I ended up adding to my AMC holdings after liquidating some rolled over 401k money a few weeks ago that hadn‚Äôt been doing much of anything in the ‚Äúsolid‚Äù mutual funds it had been invested in. I have various avg dollar costs as my AMC positions are in multiple accounts and could probably cash out for close to $20k profit right now. My reason for being here and owning these stocks has changed though. My hands have become diamond like I guess you could say. I‚Äôm holding bc I believe there is massive manipulation and unfair trading going on that can‚Äôt be seen. Also, after hanging in there and holding though the lowest of lows, I‚Äôm certain there‚Äôs more than $20k up for grabs for those that are patient. 

Now, onto my actual reason for posting for the first time ever. My daughter is 2 and a half years old and tomorrow she undergoes heart surgery. She has an artery that grew the wrong way and wrapped around her trachea causing severe compression. The surgery has been scheduled for a few months now but it has really hit me as it has gotten closer and is now finally here. I don‚Äôt ask for upvotes or awards...I simply ask for your prayers!

If anyone sees this just please pray for my daughter Everly and that all goes well tomorrow. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª

You might consider opening a straddle or strangle if you expect big changes in a stock price before a certain date, but you're not sure in which direction. For example, perhaps you believe a major legal or regulatory decision is around the corner. If your expectation of higher volatility pans out, you could realize a gain regardless of whether the stock price rises or falls (i.e., your outlook can be both bullish and bearish).

Your maximum potential gain is unlimited, since the stock price could theoretically rise to any number. On the other hand, the stock price could drop to $0, which could also yield significant gains for the straddle or strangle holder. Both of these scenarios are highly unlikely though. Your maximum potential loss is the total premium you pay upfront for the options. Strangles are usually less expensive to open than straddles, but strangles require the stock to move more for you to realize a gain.",Is this an option?,1.0,1615941337,LeadTsunami

37,m6nvqj,"I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here‚Äôs my update after today‚Äôs fuckery. 

Real quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that‚Äôs what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I‚Äôm doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best/expect the worst. This is why I‚Äôm hype, take it or leave it. I also don‚Äôt have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.

First, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That‚Äôs the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I‚Äôm sitting there getting kissed off because it‚Äôs like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell‚Äôs D tomorrow before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn‚Äôt help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn‚Äôt know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.

The whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It‚Äôs comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It‚Äôs like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. 

Here‚Äôs my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we‚Äôre not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don‚Äôt think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That‚Äôs my hope. Today‚Äôs sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won‚Äôt. 

If RKT can bounce back above 26 then we‚Äôre right back in the game. Again, there really weren‚Äôt many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. 

If the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That‚Äôs the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. 

Let‚Äôs finish the week off positively. We‚Äôre in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it‚Äôs undervalued as shit.",When there is max pain there is max profit.,1.0,1615941664,Thorbeans

59,m6o17x,"Posted a trade idea of Jan 2022 75cs or any leaps really due to a bunch of factors. To reiterate, MO has broken a 4 year down trend, a close above 49.96 would signal a weekly breakout, loads of cash on hand, many patents, and their 49% ownership of CRON. 

A lot of this depends on federal legalization of weed occurring sometime this year, something that I think has an 80% chance of happening despite no official time table on it. However, should that occur, no other company in the sector is even close to the position the MO (Altria) is in when it comes to potential domination. But I went over this in my last post. 

This post, I wanted to bring more attention to the technicals and price action that is occurring. This morning MO was downgraded by Citi because they think smoking will be non existent by 2050... yea okay... yet MO held consistent with yesterday‚Äôs closed and showed more positive signs of momentum. What really is getting me interested is that the MM selling these options, seems to be starting to realize that they messed up. All day today, despite the stock being down, leaps premiums were up, AND on less volume than the day prior. This means that some of the big boys are waking up to the possibility that this could be a huge year, and that there‚Äôs no reason 50% otm calls should be priced as they are now with the current momentum going for it. 

Finally, the comparison to VIAC
[MO vs VIAC](https://imgur.com/gallery/fokYDcm)

As you can see, both followed the same 4/5 year down trend, although VIAC dipped a bit harder last year. Once things started moving up however, and VIAC triggered its first weekly breakout in 4 years the first week of January 2021, it lit up. THIS IS THE SAME TRIGGER THAT MO IS APPROACHING NOW. Both companies were seen as low P/E value stocks that were good for being cash cows and high dividend yields, with nearly identical charts, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too far fetched that MO follow this move or makes one similar to it, but across the span of 4-5 months rather than 2

VIAC was sparked by their announcement of their streaming service, which led to revaluations and ofc a sky rocket in SP. While MO may not have a streaming service, the legalization of cannabis, if played right by Altria, should lead to high upside and an argument for SAAS. (Smoking as a service), one of their patents is for a juul like device that you can use weed concentrates, OR dry flower/hash stuff like that. Now imagine them selling ‚ÄúPods‚Äù of Weed Nicotine mixed. Double price of normal pods. Boom. Brings pot smokers to tobacco, and tobacco smokers to weed all the while ensuring monster profits YoY

TLDR: MO and VIAC very similar charts, nearly identical breakouts, MO Tons of potential catalysts and LEAPs underpriced.

Out of pure luck I just choose MCD, AAPL and TSLA to check and it just happens that these stocks are in a similar boat as GME. However after checking other stocks I could not find any others like this so I guess I got lucky on which ones to check first. 

TSLA is weird because it is reported to have only 5% of the float shorted while both AAPL and MCD have 60% of the float shorted! Also what is going on with MCD and AAPL?? They are reported to have more of their floats shorted than GME. 

 All of this info is straight from Finra. Just put it into a sheet to make it read easy. GME is there for a comparison.

**My opinion &amp; theory:** 

When the wild dips started hitting GME, we knew it's hedgie scum as no apes are selling. The attacks recently are getting more consistent. Why ? because the quadruple witching (not guaranteed lift off) date is approaching.  The hedgies want to kill momentum desperately as they want to turn quadruple witching into a dud; pushing more apes to sell in a bid to avoid the \*ahem\* squeeze and pocketing all the money apes splashed on retarded OTM calls.

As it stands, they want the price to be at under $200 on March 19 to make all the calls expire worthless. If the price goes beyond; it may trigger a huge volume change; prepping the ground for you know what.

The $200 price info comes from the Bloomberg Terminal posted here [in this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6eagp/bloomberg_terminal_update_on_031621_important/). 

Q: What is Bloomberg Terminal ?  

A: Like Bloomberg found a WSB sub on reddit.

It all makes sense now if you look at the history of attacks over the past few days. Today early ladder attack got the price down to $175ish after which they let their foot off the gas to save some ammo for the following days. This is where the want the price to be throughout this week. Even at the end of AH trading, they pulled the price back at $201; prepping to dip it under $200 tomorrow pre-market.

**Ok, so what's your point ?**

The apes are holding, idgaf what the shills here say. We know that and we are keeping our end of the bargain and HODLing. But believe it or not, the hedgie scum knows this well by scouring through this sub and capitalizing on us HODLing. I guarantee that they are shorting the stock each day, everyday and making bank, buying puts and collecting more ammo ($$$). What's allowing this to happen is the predictability of Retail traders. They have seen our cards and are playing us and playing hard. As much as we like to believe that they are curled up in ball and crying in their glass clad offices, they are not. They are devising new ways on making $$$, whether it be getting banks to create junk bonds (Big Short &amp; Shitadel ref).

**My Strategy:**

Young Apes and faint hearted should not read below this line.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (not we) using my very own smoothest of the smooth brains fucked them in their own game already (by doing my DD diamond handing my GME). Why not do it again ? Play their game, short your positions with their ladder attacks and buy GME back at a lower price point. I did this today ended up +$600 by selling at $217 and buying back at $205. Put it back into GME for 3 more. This play comes with an oath to myself to buy back my original position even in case my play goes sideways. A small price to pay for salvation ! The hedgie attacks have also been quite predictable with one major attack per day bringing the price down followed by GME saw-sawing between +-$20 range. If I can predict it, I can exploit it and pull freebies out of hedgie asses.

Diamond Handing means: I buy ATLEAST my daily starting position at end of the day, if not more, EVERYDAY !

Remember, our key play in GME is **BUY** &amp; **HODL**

91,m6odpo,"More MO DD, the next VIAC?

Posted a trade idea of Jan 2022 75cs or any leaps really due to a bunch of factors. To reiterate, MO has broken a 4 year down trend, a close above 49.96 would signal a weekly breakout, loads of cash on hand, many patents, and their 49% ownership of CRON. 

A lot of this depends on federal legalization of weed occurring sometime this year, something that I think has an 80% chance of happening despite no official time table on it. However, should that occur, no other company in the sector is even close to the position the MO (Altria) is in when it comes to potential domination. But I went over this in my last post. 

This post, I wanted to bring more attention to the technicals and price action that is occurring. This morning MO was downgraded by Citi because they think smoking will be non existent by 2050... yea okay... yet MO held consistent with yesterday‚Äôs closed and showed more positive signs of momentum. What really is getting me interested is that the MM selling these options, seems to be starting to realize that they messed up. All day today, despite the stock being down, leaps premiums were up, AND on less volume than the day prior. This means that some of the big boys are waking up to the possibility that this could be a huge year, and that there‚Äôs no reason 50% otm calls should be priced as they are now with the current momentum going for it. 

Finally, the comparison to VIAC

[MO vs VIAC](https://imgur.com/gallery/fokYDcm)

As you can see, both followed the same 4/5 year down trend, although VIAC dipped a bit harder last year. Once things started moving up however, and VIAC triggered its first weekly breakout in 4 years the first week of January 2021, it lit up. THIS IS THE SAME TRIGGER THAT MO IS APPROACHING NOW. Both companies were seen as low P/E value stocks that were good for being cash cows and high dividend yields, with nearly identical charts, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too far fetched that MO follow this move or makes one similar to it, but across the span of 4-5 months rather than 2

VIAC was sparked by their announcement of their streaming service, which led to revaluations and ofc a sky rocket in SP. While MO may not have a streaming service, the legalization of cannabis, if played right by Altria, should lead to high upside and an argument for SAAS. (Smoking as a service), one of their patents is for a juul like device that you can use weed concentrates, OR dry flower/hash stuff like that. Now imagine them selling ‚ÄúPods‚Äù of Weed Nicotine mixed. Double price of normal pods. Boom. Brings pot smokers to tobacco, and tobacco smokers to weed all the while ensuring monster profits YoY

TLDR: MO and VIAC very similar charts, nearly identical breakouts, MO Tons of potential catalysts and LEAPs underpriced.

94,m6oe3x,"My father moved us from a small town in Belgrade. When we first came to the U.S., he was poor, unskilled, and could hardly speak the language. An ape if you will. In our American town, he only had a few options of employment, but he was systematically denied at each one. I will never forget the horrible day that he applied to our local game store, called EB Games, and received a similarly calloused response. This event infuriated him so thoroughly, that he yelled violently at the store manager. I remember him screaming ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt Letta me Be a stupid Game Man?? YOU WONT LETTA ME BE A STUPID GAME MAN?!!.‚Äù This phrase echoes in my mind still. It broke him, and I was crying. 

This one rejection became a pivotal moment in my family. The denial haunted my father so much so, that he ended up leaving the U.S., and returned back to Belgrade. My mother and I were left to fend for ourselves. Yes, my fellow retards, this baby ape was reared alone.

Years later, EB Games closed its doors, and a  new store took its place. A GameStop. A bright and brilliantly shining GameStop. I will never forget this day, and I went along with my friends to it‚Äôs grand opening. However upon taking my first step inside, I was immediately sickened by past memory. I was hit by the thought that if my father had only gone to this very GameStop, that he may have stayed and loved me and my mother. That he may have raised me to be less deformed, less hairy, less dumb. That he may have even given me a name. Something that my mother had inexplicably failed to do as a child. So here I write to you, nameless, dejected, a profoundly retarded boy. But as I reminisce on this night, I feel compelled to remind you that this store is not merely a nameless place. It is GME. It is a place that many of us have interacted with, often joyously in our lives. It is a place that has provided countless hours of mirth and fulfillment; and In my case, it may have even been a place that could have saved my family. 

So I ask you to keep this story in your thoughts during the coming weeks. The coming weeks will be a battle that will need consistent emotional underpinning. We are constantly given DD‚Äôs that have brilliant analyses and theory. The truly most retarded of us are capable of weaving logic so passionate and circular, that it defies any explanation. But I am not that ape. I have no financial advice, just my story. An emotional DD, a human due diligence. If you could keep me in your thoughts when you go to buy your shares this week, I will keep you all in my thoughts as well. I want you to remember that each share is a prayer. Each share is a prayer to me. And quietly, Each share I buy, is a prayer to my father. Let‚Äôs save this store. Let‚Äôs save the store that would have saved my family.",GME - Let me tell you about my father,1.0,1615943234,OKAnimus
