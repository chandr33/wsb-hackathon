28,m2rxyz,"These are my thoughts on a very solid article on the GME gamma squeeze which fits the available data well and shows a reasonable case for both correlation and causation between OTM call option buying and the stock price movements. It can be found here and has been doing the rounds on WSB:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/?sh=7314f9ff4225

To be fair, only apes, bagholders or the very inexperienced actually believed the reason was a short squeeze. You can't tell them that though no matter what evidence is given to the contrary. The gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility.

Here are a couple of other thoughts I had while reading the article that support a very bearish case:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **A gamma squeeze needs at      least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising:**

**a)** People buying OTM calls in very large volumes

**b)** The stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock (or calls themselves, of different delta's and expiry's ) to re-hedge.

There are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions don't occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends - remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment - as it's clearly not fundamentals (it's a 15-25$ stock) or a short squeeze.

**Here the issues with condition a)**

Looking at the ATM weekly call 250$, expiring March 19, we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 (75$) giving a breakeven price at expiry ( not paying any attention to the other greeks. which given the theta decay and possible IV movements will hurt the buyer) of $325.

The 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ (4700$)giving a break even price of 397$.

Now, the problem with this is simple: These very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford, even those well OTM. **Usually the retards might be able to afford a short term (weekly) OTM lottery ticket type option that you see yolo'ed here on WSB all the time, but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium (implied volatility) , the vast majority of apes are well priced out - a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys.**

In addition, IV has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days AND earnings is just two weeks away. IV typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings, so these calls will become even more expensive (even if no share price drop occurs). Ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of it's own success.

**Here are the issues with condition b)**

Of course, the share price is pretty volatile day to day so I'm not going to try to predict it, but I would note a couple of important points:

\- The share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze (see article) and once people realize this many who don't understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon. The holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or 'buying the dip"" (retailers volume is estimated to be around 1/10th of institutions/MM's/quant funds/ hedgies, most days at least) makes no difference - this isn't a short squeeze after all. Additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will ( see yesterdays 40% drop in 20 minutes) to suit their needs, and we don't know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock (short term algos) and so on. Maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls, but if they hold puts they will want it down. We simply don't know for sure, other than to note the current open interest put/call ratio is around 3:1 - or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls.

   
 

More importantly for the share price to 'gamma squeeze' you NEED condition a) to be fulfilled. It is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy OTM calls on mass. This is not happening anymore.

\- Secondly, the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers (who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral) re-hedging their position. Again this poses massive risks for bulls, as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop. As the price drops those OTM and ATM calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value. Now if the price drops enough ( as an example if you bought just before the halt that ATM weekly (250 strike) call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$, a massive loss) the market makers will begin to re-hedge their risk in any of these ways:

\- Buy the call back for a significant discount ( or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay). This means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises.

\- Buy the now other (now) much cheaper calls\* to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge

Now, I've kind of skipped over the details here, but this is the essence of what should/could happen. Now of course, those calls\* themselves that are used to re-hedge will also have to be re-hedged by other market makers, but usually it's much cheaper to re-hedge a suddenly OTM call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta - it requires less purchase of the underlying. **So basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction - as the price drops, the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares, and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues.** It has similarities ( but is NOT the same -I'm not saying that at all) to a gamma squeeze, except now it's reversed, and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldn't be as violent. This is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited (stock price can moon indefinitely - in theory) and thus are riskier for market makers, but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0. 

 

**TLDR:**

Bulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze can't be sustained. This is due to market makers re-hedging ATM/OTM sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price.

Whatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly (hours/days) especially once people realize what is going on. 

**Positions:**

Tons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expiry's 23-43 days out. 

**Sorry for the novel - I would/will put this as a DD next time.**

**Edit**: A helpful person mentioned that I should have explicitly stated that you need **both extremely bullish ITM and OTM** call option activity to create a gamma squeeze. I totally agree and should have mentioned that.","What the GME Gamma Squeeze needs to keep going, and why it will probably run out of fuel.",1.0,1615474474,sofarsogood84
