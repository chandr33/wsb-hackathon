0,m6l988,"	One thing I‚Äôve truly been enjoying on this rocket journey to TendieTown with you glorious apes are the trips down memory lane. Like many of you I grew up in a simpler time when you could avoid social activity by staying home and playing video games or embrace it by meeting your friends at the movie theatre. Now I realize that gaming can be a great social activity and movies can sometimes be better alone (I mean you don‚Äôt want your boys seeing you cry when Rudy takes the field), but that‚Äôs kind of my point. We should have the option to watch movies at home or in a crowded theater sharing that experience. We should be able to decide whether to fill precious space on our hard drives with digital games or to stand in lines at midnight with our fellow nerds to get that first tangible, special edition of the game we pre-ordered months ago. Hedgies think they are simply rooting for a company to fail, when really they are trying to force us into a life of solitude where we download what we need and become more and more disconnected simply so they can add a few more zeros to a balance sheet or bank account. 

	So in addition to buying and holding these stocks with your beautiful diamond hands, I invite you all to join me in supporting these companies that have given us so much and are simply trying to navigate an ever evolving digital world. In addition to going to the movies and buying that extra large popcorn or online ordering those games and merch while trading in the things you no longer use so another person can enjoy them, show them support in other ways that benefit us all in the long run. Renew or purchase your PowerUp Rewards, AMC Stubs or whatever other loyalty subscription program your favorite companies offer. Show them you believe in them by not only holding their stocks, but providing $15 a year in revenues in exchange for points or discounts. Get jobs at these amazing companies so you can proudly wear that brand while earning just enough to buy those dips. So you can help them succeed while they help you come out of your Covid Bunker and reconnect with real live apes instead of just Reddit usernames. Not because we need the disposable income to afford outrageous ticket prices and overpriced snacks or because we need the points to afford the newest games, I mean we pull up in Lambos because we loved these companies enough to support them when billionaires attempted to profit on their demise. Do so because they represent something bigger than calls and puts, or short percentages and failures to deliver. They represent what it means to be alive.

Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don‚Äôt matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‚Äòoh no I got caught‚Äô fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I‚Äôve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let‚Äôs dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock‚Äôs total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel‚Äôs? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let‚Äôs see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine &amp; a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‚Äòbest execution‚Äô for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn‚Äôt in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine &amp; Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 ‚Äì August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC‚Äôs potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‚Äòsystem issue‚Äô which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I‚Äôm getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‚Äòoh X didn‚Äôt know, they‚Äôre not trained!‚Äô as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure&amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 ‚Äì August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 ‚Äì February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure &amp; Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it‚Äôll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn‚Äôt give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

My first DD on WSB! And yes of course I'll add the obligatory ""this is not investment advice but rather my own opinion based on publicly available information. Carefully consider your own investment objectives and risk factors before investing.""

I don‚Äôt know about you folks, but I guess after a few down days and a $224/share avg I needed some reassurance that our GME will indeed take off one day. So, I dug deep into the memory banks and recalled one important supply-demand ratio from my investment finance classes, namely the Turnover Ratio (TRO). 

Do you ever notice how some stocks seem to soar suddenly, often with little or no news? While other stocks can receive ongoing great news and hardly move higher at all? Well, my smooth brained apes‚Ä¶as you can imagine it‚Äôs all about supply and demand.  

At the end of the day what makes a stock rise in value? If you answered ‚Äúmore buyers than sellers‚Äù than you win a banana! So how do we compare one stock to another and determine how changes in demand can affect the upward (or downward movement) of the price? 

A quick definition check: 

10-D AVG VOL (10-day average volume): Reflects more current trading activity, expressed as average daily volume over the last 10 trading days 

FL (Float): We‚Äôre all well versed on this one, but just in case float is ‚Äúthe number of shares outstanding, or all the shares there are for that company, minus what is owned by insiders and what the company is holding back (treasury stock). In a nutshell, associate the float with the supply of shares available to be traded at any given time by the public.‚Äù 

So with those definitions in mind, I decided to pull Yahoo Finance‚Äôs Top 25 most active stocks for today, March 16th and dive right in. Most active stocks are listed in order of today‚Äôs volume. I then added additional columns for, you guessed it, 10-D AVG VOL and FL. 

This now sets us up for the simple TURNOVER RATIO (TRO) calculation, which is 10-D AVG VOL / FL. 

If the float is very large relative to the average volume (lots of shares out there to be bought and sold in relationship to the average volume) we would see a low turnover ratio and thus an onrush of buyers would not move the price much (think Ford stock) 

However, if the float is low relative to the average volume (a lot of people wanting very few available shares,) a sudden rush of buyers could move the price of a stock dramatically (think Gamestop).

So how does our precious little GME rank. Have a look and see for yourself! 

GME‚Äôs TRO is 93%. Ninety-Three Per Cent!!! 

That's 25% higher than the next highest security (SNDL), and a whopping 86% higher than the entire group average!

This essentially means 930 out of every 1,000 tradeable shares of GME have changed hands every single day over the last ten days. 

This tells us GME is a VERY volatile a stock that will trade violently given an imbalance in supply or demand either to the up or downside.  

So let me ask you this: Did you sell your stock recently? Did you? What about you? I sure as hell didn‚Äôt? So how the fuck is this possible? Easy. This is exactly what all the brilliant DD‚Äôs before me have already confirmed: There are synthetic GME shares out the whazooo being traded ALL DAY LONG. With short and naked-short interest estimated anywhere between 2-5x float we are about to witness a historic imbalance play out before us. 

My fellow apes and ape-ettes, we are patiently waiting for liftoff on the ‚Äúright‚Äù side of this very equation. All we need to do is HOLD and continue to keep this Turnover Ratio in our favor. The greedy idiots that decided to double and triple down on GME‚Äôs demise WILL be held accountable someday very soon. 

And don‚Äôt forget to ensure your 5-pt harnesses are buckled up tight. When this thing takes off we‚Äôll be pulling G-forces that‚Äôll peel our eyelids back and leave a stream of diarrhea behind us.  

See you in the Oort Cloud!

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. **All trading strategies are used at your own risk.**

76,m6ls2r,"Alternative trading mechanisms, ATs, are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (broker-clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders and their clients at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. 

The reason they were designed is avoid market volatility which large transactions can induce if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called traderbots, distribute the shares in dark pools, in a way they don't get seen, with the purpose of limiting disruptions on price prematurely revealing positioning by large investors and institutional clients.  

At first, ATs and its regulations were designed to trade shares done in ‚Äùblock transactions‚Äù around 10k to 500k in size, with a lower price fees than the average market pays for the transactions. That is fundamentally why they exist, that is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely in the attached article as ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù market participant (behavior by market makers). In a data research attached in the paper it was discovered that instead of ‚Äúblock transactions‚Äù the number of shares regularly exchanged are done by an average of 181 shares per transaction.

There is not transparecence in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to the them to check the wrong deed.

Here is Barclay‚Äôs disclamer piece from their analysis about misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:

‚ÄúThe analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its own dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, ‚Äú[n]one of which,‚Äù recalled one Director, ‚Äúhad a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.‚Äù Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.

These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independent of a HF (YOU) or not in the market.

[Extract]

-How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior: 

a) to front-runs transactions, 

b)  to avoid regulation, 

c)  to sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), 

d) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, 

e) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),

f) to virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.

Does that sounds familiar??? 

A lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions of millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and ‚Äùtimes and sales‚Äù charts running a race so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body candles out of context with the overall price action; that as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else. Then is when number of shares don't make any sense.

The author of the paper went a step forward saying that ‚ÄùATSs and dark pools are in essence, a private market.‚Äù

The idea is that this forms of trading by High frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. 

How is this becomes illegal? 

‚ÄùIf dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.‚Äù

When a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it‚Äôs intent can becoming malicious practices. Where they can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. ‚Äùnaked shorting‚Äù sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator‚Äôs books (not sent to NSCC/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosured securities positions and numbers exceeding the amount of shares a security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It‚Äôs one of the techniques that shitty HF hedge themselves in the market.

For those of you who went to school, sometime around the first grade, your teacher probably asked you what wanted to be when you grew up. For those of you who wanted to be cool, you probably responded with, ‚ÄúI wan to b a asteronawt wen I grw up.‚Äù Unfortunately, many of you have had to shelve your dreams to pay the man his due, and decided that perhaps shift-manager at Wendy‚Äôs is a better fit. And that‚Äôs ok. There is no shame in feeding people, it is an honest job. However, your sacrifice for the betterment of society does not have to cost you your dreams. You could now have the rare opportunity to see what your life might have been like if you had chosen a different career path; This is your chance to wipe the frosty off your peach fuzz, toss your headset in the trash on the march to the door only stopping momentarily to pivot back, take one last look at the place before you leave and yell, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back next Monday.‚Äù The opportunity beckons to drive that Saturn of yours‚Äô out to New Mexico, pull on a jumpsuit and hop aboard a 21st century spaceship along with your fellow pioneers and travel into the heavens above.¬†

Space Tourism. Exotic man.¬†¬†

Brought you by the King of Necker Island, who is offering everyone the opportunity to penetrate the virginity of the sky and throw off the chastity of gravity, thrusting 55 miles deep into the galactic promise land first depicted in the 1969 Hollywood classic, the Moon Landing. All of this for the low-low price of $250,000, or the approximate fee to open five Wendy‚Äôs franchises.¬†

Picture it now. ‚ÄúAs the count-down loomed, a strange old fellow stepped aboard WhiteKnightTwo as we strapped into our space chairs. He had a peculiar appearance, his shell adorned with a leather jacket, aviator sunglasses and rather oddly, a pair of trecking sandals. A long silver weave spilled from the summit of his head, dancing access the weathered hide stretched across his protruded brow as he strut. He wore a grizzly beard, partially kempt and stained around his mouth hole by vegan fry oil. The man paused to inspect the passengers, a rag-tag team of space pioneers, and cast a wide grin of approval exposing a wonky set of teeth. He introduced himself as Sir Richard Branson, a knight. I thought to myself, for a knight, he looks a little like a silverback gorilla. He began to proselytize, ‚ÄúWe are at the vanguard of a new industry determined to pioneer twenty-first century spacecraft, which will open space to everybody ‚Äî and change the world for good.‚Äù His words sent chills through my skin and the reality of the moment began to set-in. Just as I had began to dream upon the adventure ahead of me, another voice entered the frame, ‚ÄúWake up bro, you passed out in the walk-in. We‚Äôre out of chicken tenders.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpace tourism‚Äù is not new. Zero-G has been bringing the American public the alluring Parabolic Flight since 2004. The business was built on a model deploying a modified civilian aircraft, which would navigate a series of sky woops and allow the customers to pretend they are an astronaut for 30 seconds at a time. Despite the obvious appeal, only some 15,000 people have dished out several thousand dollars for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of ‚Äòfloating in space‚Äô like an astronaut. It isn‚Äôt like they didn‚Äôt get the media attention, or lack for celebrity clientale. They've hosted Buzz Aldrin (a real astronaut), Martha Stewart, Penn and Teller, Tony Hawk, an appearance on Mythbusters and if I recall from my childhood, an adult film to test the feasibility of a device for copulation in a zero gravity environment. They even sent Stephen Hawking hurtling about inside the fuselage, the image alone tugging on our basic humanity. However, despite all of this notoriety, they apparently did not generate enough appeal to the masses to justify a billion-dollar IPO.¬†

Unfortunately for early investors into Zero-G, the experience of a SPACing a company into an $8B dumpster fire was a secret yet to be discovered. For Sir Richard Branson, with support from venture capitalist Aziz Ansari with the clairvoyance to forge paths uncharted, this opportunity is yours today for the cut-rate price of some 30 bananas share!¬†

But this is different, those planes don‚Äôt go into space! Let‚Äôs be accurate, Virgin Galactic does NOT travel into space as most made-made objects in orbit are not in ‚Äúspace‚Äù either, including the International Space Station. The ISS orbits at 254 miles, while Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is some 600 miles out from center. Meanwhile, the moon is orbiting some 225 thousand miles away. True definitions aside, I am not the one to tell every astronaut besides the Apollo crews that they are the penultimate example of ‚Äúeverybody gets a medal.‚Äù Imagine the sense of devaluation that genuinely incredible people will feel when the first TikTok influencer live-streams themselves becoming an astronaut wearing their sponsors figure enhancing bikini suit. Check-out my spacesuit by Kylie, this is my truth everybody. However, just like the self-indulgent vacations to some opulent destination lavished with amenities and butt pics, you similarly will not be able to afford the experience of a trip into low-earth orbit for $250,000, including a few months off for training before hand. And that‚Äôs for all for destination-less trip.¬†

With SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY wolf tickets pre-purchased, SPCE officially is generating less interest and ‚Äòpledged‚Äô revenue than NKLA. I am not saying Sir Richard Branson is Trevor Milton. I am simply stating, that Nikola rolled a more serviceable product down a hill than SPCE is dumping out of a flying catamaran named after an extra from the opening scene in Bad Boys II. Still, it hasn‚Äôt stopped world renowned Climate Activist Leonardo Decaprio from declaring his intent to climb aboard a 21st century spacecraft pissing rocket fuel accross the upper atmosphere in the name of tourism.¬†

The Vision. SPCE is built on a business model, whereby they be the spaceline offering ‚Äúhigh-frequency‚Äù trips to an array of orbiting destination‚Äôs, accessible to a broad customer base, or ‚Äúeverybody.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn time, we expect to be operating a variety of vehicles from multiple locations to cater for the demands of the growing space-user community. Whether that be transporting passengers to Earth orbiting hotels and science laboratories, or providing a world-shrinking, transcontinental service ‚Äì at Virgin Galactic we will always be striving to open space to change the world for good.‚Äù Read their vision statement as, ‚Äúwhen the demand doesn't appear in your lifetime and we inevitably fail, we will have spent billions developing a 21st century Concorde Jet with a smaller passenger capacity, less efficient takeoff and landing, with fewer accessible airports, and at a significantly greater expense to the consumer.‚Äù

Keep in mind, this is not Virgin Orbit. They will not be earning revenues from launching satellites, or carrying cargo to the ISS. They will not be capturing asteroids and mining exotic metals. They will not be leaving orbit and travelling to Mars, or the moon. They are a transportation service for travel to orbital destinations that don‚Äôt exist.¬†

But Cathie Wood invested in SPCE, and she is great stockpicker! Get it straight, YOU are the surrogate, not the other way around.¬†

Pessimist outlook aside, lets explore whether there is any realistic expectation of such an industry in the near future (2-5 years.)¬†

Is it plausible that there will be some floating infrastructure available for commercial customers?¬†

Yes, and technically, it is already true. In 2022, there is a private commercial crew from Axiom slated to make a visit to the ISS, at a cost of $55 million per paying passenger. The bad news for SPCE - they will be making their way there with SpaceX. However, they are also not average consumers, but hand-picked individuals with the means, who will be attached to an Axiom crew which is ran by wait for it, ex-NASA people who joined the private sector ‚Äì kind of like how high-ranking members of the military join a defense contractor and make a trillion dollars selling a stealth rock. Still, privatizing the transport of payloads into space is one thing and probably for the better, but government will not be funding the orbiting hospitality and research industry which does not represent a potential revenue stream for SPCE. Perhaps in the future, government labratories will be serviced commercially, however at a frequency which is unlikely to cater to a passenger transport model. More likely, it will be passengers + cargo, which of course their delivery method isn't designed for.¬†

The ISS has been in orbit since 1998 at a build cost of ~$150B and has the capacity to support SIX visitors. There have been a few private companies which have pursued developing space infrastructure, and a few start-ups which are projecting near-term, serviceable habitats for travelers.¬†

One billionaire UFO enthusiast made inflatable modules, and even tested some in space. Unfortunately, he laid off his entire staff in March 2020.¬†

The most realistic hopes are in Axiom, who have been given the go ahead to develop commercial modules which will be attached to the ISS. They are scheduled for launch in 2024. Their modules will remain attached to the ISS until 2028, at which time the ISS is slated to be retired, and the Axiom modules will decouple and remain aloft as the first commercial space station. So there it is, the aggressive time-line of 2028 for the FIRST commercial space station, requiring some dark nebula of government subsidy as a catalyst, with a projected cost of development around $3B. I forgot to mention, NASA is officially going to compensate Axiom ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION dollars for whatever value their attached modules will bring. Only TWO BILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED and FIFTY MILLION dollars until break-even.¬†

Assuming for the station owner:¬†

The station lasts 30 years, as long as the ISS, this will require ~$1.9m a week for 26 years¬†

The station has the capacity for at least 6 people, as many as the ISS, that necessitates ~$314k + OPERATING COSTS OF A SPACE STATION PER WEEK, PER GUEST¬†

I did not calculate the undefined potential of their manufacturing module, with capabilities said to rival the likes of a high-school shop class.¬†

For SPCE, with the assumptions above, the potential revenue looks like this assuming:

The SPCE spacecrap does not stay docked, and in-bound and out-bound travel is covered under their ~$250k ticket cost, the ~$250K ticket covers all of SPCE‚Äôs costs associated with the flight, they have a contract as the SOLE transportation provider to and from the SOLE destination, and an average guest stay of one-week, that amounts to EIGHTY-FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR in revenue.¬†

For reference, SPCE currently has quarterly operating costs of some ~70M.¬†

Hotels in orbit? Dreamland in the next 5 years. There are again numerous companies proclaiming a near term deployment of hotels and other orbiting habitats. Among them is a ‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù whose concept was leeched from a film and deemed ‚Äúwhat not to do,‚Äù as well as being named after a Nazi. It has now been updated into a spinning piece of trash modelled after the wheel from The Price Is Right and named Voyager Station, which these idiots claim will host ~400 people and be in operation by 2027.¬†

Other concepts include slinging a commercial propane tank into the sky named Aurora Station after the Aurora Borealis, which it will promptly careen through on premature re-entry to crash into the population below. This hotel is designed to host 6 people (2 crew), and has been described as ‚Äúcozy‚Äù by the manufacturer. For $9.5 million dollars, guests will be treated to a 12-day claustrophobia experiment where they will play space games, shower from a bag and seeing how far they can spit. In terms of anticipated operational dates, the California start-up plans to launch their concept into space in 2021, begin operations in 2022, and then begin construction of the module in 2023, dogged by questions of where the fuck they launched their first 4 guests and 2 crew members the prior year.¬†

Regardless, if we learned anything from Kevin Costner, its that if you build it, they will come. The difference here is rather than building the baseball field, SPCE is building a magic cornfield, and hoping some microdosing ex silicon valley executive will subsidize infrastructure at a loss since I don't foresee customers coming from heaven. Transport few can afford, to a place that even fewer can afford to go, which also doesn‚Äôt exist. Thats some sunburnt logic.¬†

Lets just take a look at what a potential checklist might look like before a hotel would be open for business. They will need: a viable concept, funding, materials, manufacturing facilities, skilled labor, among many other dependencies to get to construction complete. After construction is finished, there will need to be operational protocols developed, on-earth inspection complete by an official body that doesn‚Äôt exist, transportation and assembly at a launch site, launch scheduled, launch achieved, in-orbit inspections and testing complete by an official body that doesn‚Äôt exist, all just to get to a place where it could be operational.¬†

Then, to put the place into business, they will to complete all of the planning that goes into hosting people in space, securing available guest dates, developing a guest training program, completing guest training, scheduling a launch, achieving a launch, successfully docking, etc.¬†

Then there are the questions that will need to be determined by politicians, like: Who will be responsible for inspecting space hotels? What are the construction standards and requirements that will deem the construct safe? Will American companies operating in outer space be subject to terrestrial law? Does an independent health inspector travel there since they will be serving food and drink? What kind of permitting, level of insurance, deposit for emergency evacuation will be required? If they complete a transaction in space, is it taxable? Will a space station be considered sovereign? Who will be responsible in the case of an assault in a space station? What is the acceptable blood alcohol concentration while in space? How will space station access be made available to underserved communities?¬†

These questions are entirely unanswered, while congress is inundated trying to understand how their stock market works and determine whether it is acceptable for a boy from Bulgaria to fleece a bunch of retards on the internet.¬†

For the sake of it, let‚Äôs say a company is successful in deploying some type of floating death trap by 2022. At what scale will the space infrastructure have to grow from there in order for the volume of visitors and flights to make a shuttle service viable? Say the propane tank doesn‚Äôt fall back to earth and decimate a remote village in Africa, and there is a 6-person capacity station, with trips at a 12-day interval. (365/12)(6)(250,000) = $45 million. But wait a minute, does it make sense for the hotel to pay for their 2 crew to fly on the shuttle back and forth every 12 days? Not really, so maybe its only 4 passengers up/down every 12. Oh yeah, SPCE is also competing against other firms, including SpaceX who are looking like the most likely vendor to ferry any sort of orbital habitat given their qualifications. It isn‚Äôt even a hard choice at that point for SpaceX to negotiate a contract with the hotel or lab owner to establish themselves as the only vendor who can deliver visitors to the station. Not to mention you also have the government darling ULA, Blue Origin, and probably some Russian outfit for the bargain hunters.¬†

Suffice to say, this isn't a viable business model in any foreseeable term, they don't have a viable product at the moment and even if they did, they are substantially outclassed and outpaced by competitors. This is Sir Richard Bransons YOLO, except rather than seeking profit, he is seeking karma.¬†

I am low on Adderall and I still have work to do so I will stop here.¬†

Lets summarize:

SPCE had $238K in annual revenue for 2020, bleeding $70M a month in operating costs, $660M cash on hand with high-level investors walking away, executives cashing out their stocks, current test flights paused for non-viable aircraft grounded to troubleshoot their latest engineering failures, flight costs which limit potential clientele to millionaires with a high-risk appetite, no realistic orbital destinations besides the ISS, significantly overshadowed by their competition and despite this outlook they are sitting on a valuation over $8B dollars. The company is expected to report quarterly decay in early May.¬†

Prediction: Commercial flights delayed until 2022, share offering upcoming to capitalize on current share value, no realistic revenue streams outside of celebrity tours until 2028-2030.¬†

95,m6lwvt,"**Hello friends,**

In the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks. 

Well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.

In the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post. 

Short Interest is up:

Todays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)

**Shorts still in the game:**

  
As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.

During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

So the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

**Housing data comes out March 17th:**

  
This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.

1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.  
2. Employment is strengthening.  
3. Economy is re-bounding.  
4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.  
5. Low rates continue.

**Open Call Options:**

Look at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day! 

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.

The housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links.... GL lol but it shows we are MOONING and so is the Housing market. 

What does this mean for ROCKET?! Well it indicates that Rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term. The current price is such a fire sale it isn't even comparable to what we will see in 5-10 years from now. 

Inflation is about to take place and we may see 5-10% increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this. 

This is Bullish for Rocket and thats why I will be holding Rocket Long term.  

**TLDR:**

**RKT is going to Gamma squeeze if we break $29.00 and 3/19 triple witching will push the price past previous highs.** 

**RKT is a great short term and long term play.** 

**RKT catalysts, Stimulus, Open Calls, Housing Data March 17th, Short interest 35%, and Triple witching 3/19.**
