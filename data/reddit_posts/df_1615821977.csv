48,m5n7z7,"Let me start by stating this is not a DD where I go deep into the financials or perspective of this company.  In short, I believe this is a very enticing short term trading opportunity, and if you are like some, may be a long term investment.  The short:

SPCE, Virgin Galactic, is a company trying to commercialize space travel.  They are founded by Richard Branson and have been around for more than 15 years.  They went public about a year ago and have been trading anywhere between mid teens to over $60.  Current price is about $35.

In December SPCE had a failed test flight.  The stock dropped about 20% to around $23/share.  From December - March the stock price got all the way up to over $60 with various new stories, ARK Space ETF, scheduled test flight, pre-flight check list, etc...  Then, without warning pre-market they cancelled the flight.  Over the next few days with no news or updates from them the stock dropped 30%.  It wasn't until the earnings call that they formally announced that they pushed back the flight to May.  After that money moving from growth, yield increases and Chamath removing his personal investment dropped the stock all the way back to $26/share a few weeks ago.

The Play:  I bought 300 shares last week with an average price of $30.25.  Also, I am playing call options with 2 week expirations (currently have 5 3/19c with $36 strike. ).  Here is where it becomes choose your own story.

**My approach**: hold shares until a week before test flight and sell everything.  SPCE doesn't have the greatest track record of success and the way they fucked me last month put a sour taste in my mouth.  I am thinking they probably push the stock up to around $45 or $50/share by then with ARK space ETF being published early April and various news items they have in the hopper such as their new aircraft, Branson flight and formal May flight window.  At that point I will be in the 50% profit range and happy.   
 I will probably sell around 80% of my shares and ride the rest.  Also, I WILL HAVE SOLD ALL MY CALLS BY THIS TIME.  

**Riskier approach**:  play it closer to the flight.  The flight windows are large and it is very dependent on weather.  The closer you get to the date the higher the price will climb.  If things go as planned it could be in the $50 - $55/share range the days leading up to the flight.  However - you are adding the risk of flight delay.  That is what got me last time and I don't have the stomach to take it.  I will still have a small amount of shares but no calls.  For bigger balled people, you can ride through this period up to the day of or day before flight and take profits.

**BIG BALL APPROACH:** play all the way through the test flight.  I think you see a big spike with successful flight since this is the gateway to the Branson flight later this year.  If all goes well, I could see another 15% - 20% price increase, to the $60 - $70 range.  You may get a bit of sell the news the day or two after the flight, but the longer outlook would be very positive.  However, if it goes wrong it goes very wrong. There will be an immediate correction back to the $30 range or lower.  Batting .500 is good for baseball but not great for rocket ships.

TLDR; SPCE is a good actual WSB play all off news stories, ARK ETF and stimmy's.  Can see 20 - 30% increase over next month as we get to test flights.  Different betting strategies for different ball sizes.",SPCE - Trade/Opportunity Dive,1.0,1615822232,walnuts24

72,m5na83,"Strangers frequently approach me on the street and say “u/-Stephen, how are you so good at the stock market? What is your secret?”

Great question. The Stock Market is really just a casino that moves with the emotions of white guys — like a quantified form of astrology with money. Some say you’re supposed to not trade emotionally, but that’s not true at all. In fact, the quite opposite: you need to stay hyper-emotional — but notably not necessarily your own emotions. 

Allow me to mansplain. Remember, the WASPy dudes who largely run Wall Street were (and I’m stereotyping only a little here) taught to repress feelings as a sign of personal strength; it’s a fundamental part of being a man. Being hyper-emotional helps you stay ahead of the game so you know what’s going to happen before their collectively repressed conscious hive-mind catches up. They only see the one, unemotional way to approach the economy, and that is why they say “no one” can consistently beat the S&amp;P indexes. You see, the stock market is EXACTLY like button mashing in video games like Street Fighter or playing Fantasy Football. You don’t really need to know how it works, what the rules are, or what these “fundamentals” are supposed to be. The S&amp;P is the average, and we’re looking to be better than average. 

Professional actors often use a phrase to get into character. This is how to do that for Wall Street: replay the end of Field of Dreams in your mind to crack open that hard emotional shell juuust enough to tap into all those repressed feelings, then hum the tune of Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville” to yourself - to keep things light. Now you’re in the right mindset. Being a white college educated male myself, this is not too difficult. Note how easily I explained subjects I am not an expert on (like acting) without hesitation? This mindset is KEY.
