25,m0lfwq,"I jumped on GME way to late and bought for an average off 200$. I missed the peak and diamondhanded all the way down to 40$.
I wouldn’t sell in the red, so I said to myself this GME will sit in my Portfolio just to show me not to FOMO into stuff when it’s way to late.

I stoped following the News and now, 1 month later suddenly I could sell it to get even.

I know, it’s against the rules to sell, but I was sure the money is gone and now it feels like straight profit 😎

58,m0li51,"I heard about GME when it was around 60-80. This was the first time when I decided to try trading with my own real money. I was afraid to be honest. But seeing you apes screaming about GME over and over made me believe that it's going to be okay. I had 500$ from the start and got into GME when it was 220, bought around ~2,3 shares.
A bit later we have seen rise and fall and rise and fall again. My hands were shaking when it hit 300, 100 and down to 40. I was afraid and my hands were about to press sell button. But one man told here ""it is never a loss until you sell"".
And this changed everything.
This was my ticket to the Moon. I bought more. Right now my account has already some green after a long long red.
Thank you guys for making me believe and for giving me a chance to be a part of it.
See ya on the Moon🚀🚀🚀
