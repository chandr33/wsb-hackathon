FDA: Priority review, breakthrough therapy designation

Current market cap: 1.576B
Outstanding shares: 31.92M

Wanted to share a company I just found last night. Pericarditis is a current COVID-19 complication and I believe that it is a very hot ticket item right now. This being worldwide exclusive and breakthrough therapy means that the market is wide open. From looking at their clinical data their recurrence rates and pain relief are substantial!

Their CEO, Sanj K. Patel, previously took Synageva public and eventually sold it for $9.5B. The BoD is heavily invested with the chairman holding ~10% of the float. Current stocktwits followers is ~1800 meaning this baby is flying lowwwwww on the radar. I think it is poised for a PDUFA run up and possible early news like AVEO yesterday. I think we could possibly be ahead of the game on this one.

Beside that there's nothing else that should hold this share price down like this, including the potential lawsuit which every company faces occasionally.. 

&amp;#x200B;

The upside for this stock:

 1. Potential consumer market gap , and it's competitor like DKNG are still cable depended. 

 2. The channel it providers its 200+ just for sports. 

3. Sport betting contract will be secured with many more states, and price valuation is not even factored in for FUBObet yet. 

4. This is a start up company like ROKU and Netflix, and their debt and earning ratio is just getting better every earning report 

5. They have only 20% ad revenue so far and 8hour avg watch from it's subscriber.

6. They will also included E-gaming Bet and channel alongside Sports betting, this is huge as almost every millennial plays game unlike the actual sports, so the viewer /subscriber itself it going to be hug gap that can be filled. 

Morgan Stanly bought 1.6 % of Fubo's share yesturday, 

Overall, in my biased oponion.. This may be really votail in the coming few weeks but entry like right now is cheap steal,  PT for this is $40 according to analysis excluding #3,6. so real PT should be at least $100 end of the year.even  considering the competitor like DKNG should be no threat to FUBO tbh",FUBO could be the next ROKU &amp; GME,1.0,1615477038,099x

 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 

So it's been a rough past few weeks since I did this original DD. I added more shares to cost average down further during the rough ride last week. The stock railed  yesterday on some good news about new services related to birthdays.

My convictions about the stock haven't changed. What has changed is the current short interest. As of 2/26 (according to nasdaq) the short count was \~ 6 million shares, with approximately  28 million  shares floating. At the current daily volume of \~1 million shares, it would take short positions approximately 6 days to cover. That's six days to really fucked up some hedgies.

&amp;#x200B;

According to some of the modeling available online (which can be WRONG!) the short interest has increased into the 40% range, which would mean about 10 million shorted shares shorted with the same float. I will wait for the Nasdaq data publication that comes tomorrow to confirm/deny this modeling.

I still believe in this stock, and imagine that the April earnings catalyst will put us in the high 30s/low 40s.
