Looking for interviews from any type of investor on Reddit to get a personal view on their experiences throughout investing in GameStop(GME). Interview will be used for a documentary that I am writing for my university. I have exhausted the use of my friends and in need of more primary research.

I am new to Reddit being that I joined this past December but I am incredibly intrigued and impressed by the amount of passionate discourse that I have found on this page. It would be extremely insightful to hear from any level of investor that has dipped their foot into investing in GameStop.

Please message me below if you are interested and we can talk further on direct message. Interviews do not need to be over the phone or on video called, though that would be preferred, but anyone willing to chat with me about their experiences during this quite dramatic time in the stock market would be extremely helpful!",Looking for interviews for a GameStop documentary,1.0,1615248513,Kitchen_Reflection68

In 2009 I was working for a Wall Street firm supplying a network of industry experts to our hedge fund clients. Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he'd just left the company. I didn't know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd's only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at a distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I'd make sure we had that.

On any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn't listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information and wanted to stay out of prison. They said I probably knew what was going on but had no emails or recordings to back that up. They all walked and I got hammered with a 30 month prison sentence. So that's how you go to prison for insider trading without actually trading. It's all true! Just Google James Fleishman. As proof that I am who I say I am here is the AMA I did here a while back. https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1v42sp/table_iama_i_went_to_prison_for_a_crime_i_did_not/",How to get locked up for Insider Trading w/o TRADING,1.0,1615248658,inside-story-book

Like most (all?) brokers, IBKR has a program to lend out customers' fully-paid (not bought on margin) stock for a small ""yield"". \[[https://www.interactivebrokers.co.in/en/index.php?f=46957](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.in/en/index.php?f=46957)\]

Due to recent (Oct 2020) SEC rule changes, IBKR is changing the way they post collateral against stock borrowed from client accounts. \[[https://www.srz.com/resources/sec-issues-guidance-regarding-fully-paid-securities-lending.html](https://www.srz.com/resources/sec-issues-guidance-regarding-fully-paid-securities-lending.html)\]

In order to remain in the stock lending program, IBKR customers have to sign revised *Master Securities Lending Agreement* and *Securities Account Control Agreement* documents by 3/31. If they don't sign, their stock will be removed from the lending pool.

Human nature being what it is, many clients will fail to sign up before the 3/31 deadline. /wsb/ nature being what it is, *no* /wsb/-tards will sign in time.

Implication: **the supply of loan stock from IBKR in meme names is likely to dry up after 3/31.**

52,m0u99a,"There's a lot to like about GOGO, and I intend to milk it for a long time if it goes as I expect (position, emoji, and best guesses below w/TL;DR).  But I'll start with:

**THE BAD**

1). If you've ever used WiFi on a plane, you've probably used Gogo In-flight Wireless.  If you're like me, you've spent a lot of time cursing Gogo, their massive rates, and spotty reception.

2). Gogo is a *heavily shorted stock*; whether this is ""bad"" depends on your point of view

3). In 2013, Gogo was subjected to lawsuits concerning its billing practices, which permitted users to sign up online, but requiring a phone call to cancel.  Shady and very Vlad-like.  None of this pleases me.  HOWEVER

**THE GOOD**

1).  YOU WHINY CLOD.  In-flight WiFi is a technical MARVEL, and any company that has a near-monopoly on providing it has a big future.  GOGO partners with British Airways, AAL, Delta, United, Virgin, and a host of other major carriers.  Anybody on a plane is compelled to cough up $ to GOGO if they want any hope of connectivity.  If business travel returns in a meaningful way, the suits will need more access than ever.  GOGO memberships have probably all lapsed right now, and it's STILL posed to beat earnings (see below).  What happens when those memberships and one-time purchases (lots of people have pent up vacations) start flowing like milk and crayons?

2). PSSSSST GOGO is a heavily shorted stock.  Check [highshortinterest.com](https://highshortinterest.com) if you want, or trust me that the Ortex data currently shows over 50% of the total float is on loan right now. Ortex also shows that the average age of a shorted share is 40 days.  Accounting for holidays, 40 trading days ago was 1/8/2021, when GOGO was trading at $10.28.  GOGO is now $12.70, and reached over 15 in the last month.  These shorts are in some trouble if there's any kind of catalyst.  üë¢üê¥

BUT WAIT, AND HERE IS THE KEY: short interest has been going down - in September 2020, short interest constituted a whopping EIGHTY percent of the float (per Ortex).  So, there has definitely been some covering - and it's been pushing the price up, along with the fundaments.  Can you think of any other solid stocks which were super shorted, and experienced a monster squeeze once the short percentages landed around 50%? I'll wait.  Meanwhile, please enjoy these complimentary   üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄs.  

3). The lawsuits are in the past and GOGO is now much clearer about their business practices.  They have been retaining new talent at the top - a new SVP is on the way, replacing Michael Bayer after years of service; Robert Crandall, a director on the board, recently BOUGHT 20,000 shares for himself just around the price of $10.50.  If Bobby C is in, EFFIT I AM IN ALSO.

4). GOGO has earnings this Thursday morning, and is expected to do quite well. [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1273605/gogo-gogo-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher?cid=CS-ACMED-FT-tale\_of\_the\_tape|yseop\_template\_9-1273605](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1273605/gogo-gogo-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher?cid=CS-ACMED-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_9-1273605).  As we all know, earnings are a mixed bag - could very well be a sell the news type event; as such, GOGO is a good short-term run-up play, but also a good longterm value play if you want to buy and hold.

**THE MEMEY**

1). It's literally called GOGO.  It will be very fun to shout this over and over again if it does well.

2). If you haven't seen Kill Bill, google Gogo Yubari and try not to make the memes DISGUSTING, YOU HORRIBLE ANIMALS.  We on WSB have reputations to protect.

3). Almost every stock on the high short interest list seems to track GME's movements.  This is some serious salience - some on the high interest list have memed already (SKT); some are still ripping (our beloved GME); some may still be in transit (RKT?  LOL).  But others are still waiting for their day in the sun.

NOW THAT GOGO is above $1b in market cap, it's ready to play with the big boys again.  This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, and I spend most of my time smashing my head into the wall on purpose because it amuses me to hear the sound in my brain.

**POSITION**: 150 shares, purchased today at an avg. cost of $12.40.  I intend to sell cc's and CSP's if/when the IV pops, picking up shares along the way as I fly the friendly skies.  This could be a long one, given the amount of covering that needs to get done.  Lots of opportunities for scalping, profit-taking, and theta.  

**BEST GUESS**: GOGO runs up toward earnings, at which point more shorts open up; sure enough, there's a sell-off on Thursday after a good report, and it looks like we're back to normal.  THAT's when I'll start my wheel strategies, as Melvin will have backed itself into a corner with a renewed short position.

**TL;dr**: üöÄ‚úà‚úà‚úà‚úà‚úà‚úàüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ 

Heavy Shorts, total market dominance on certain airlines, renewed pricing opportunities and revenue, air travel returning, people need WiFi on planes, GOGO is fun to say and look at.

Now with the sector rotation dappled with a technical/fundamental correction in the market, we might see some sell off in value stocks.  

This is when $TACO came in.  Today they announced their quarterly results and it actually surprised a lot of analysts.  With the massive massive closures in restaurants, they only managed to decrease revenue by 0.24%.  

Which begs the question, exactly how are they getting the revenue and how much did PPP help with their balance sheet?

For someone that went to USC 10 years ago, I wasn‚Äôt overly thrilled with their tacos tacos mostly because I liked the taco stands.  Then again with the shutdown, I‚Äôm sure the taco stands took a huge hit.

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of $TACO:

Shares of Del Taco Restaurants (NASDAQ:TACO) rose in after-market trading after the company reported Q4 results.

Quarterly Results

Earnings per share were up 11.11% year over year to $0.20, which beat the estimate of $0.14.

Revenue of $156,721,000 decreased by 0.24% year over year, which beat the estimate of $156,100,000.

92,m0ui8g,"Ok, like a lot I've jumped on the I like the stock bandwagon.

My background is IT as a job and using digital currency on exchanges for trading to earn money. I also mine, and stake.  So moving over to a traditional exchange wasn't to hard for simple trades. I'm learning options and spreads slowly without taking to much risk. I'm really liking doing traditional trading.

7 years ago I cashed out my IRAs and 401k went all in on digital currency and never looked back and made a money making hobby out of it.

Now you know my background, I hope that will help you help me.

I'm currently using Robinhood for trading and options. Of course using other research tools to make the right moves. It's a little easier than trading digital currency because, well it's tangible or retail and speculating it's a little easier. It's all numbers, digital is mostly by mumbles and whales. Ok I'm getting off track.

Ok, on the 10th Roblox is having it's IPO. I've never dealt with an IPO. In digital I've always stayed away from ICOs, because if you know anything about ICOs they are mostly scams or blow-up and go away.

I think Roblox will be good for long. My son is way into it and even helps develope a couple of games. I've seen the platform and what it can do and how well it helps developers monetize their games. Ok ok I'm getting off track again.

So what can I expect from the IPO?
I assume it starts at bell? 
How is it speculated share cost?
Should I stick with Robinhood or move to a better more advanced platform for this and the future?
Will this or other IPOs get crazy fast? I would think so.

 I think they are only offering 199 million in stock, but I see no mention of quantity of shares.

This will prepare me for when Skylink IPO.

TIA
