 What Is the Third Market?

A third market consists of trading conducted by non-exchange member broker-dealers and [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) of exchange-listed stocks. In other words, the third market involves exchange-listed securities that are being traded over-the-counter between broker-dealers and [large institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/institutional-investors/).

The term ""[over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp)"" typically refers to the trading of securities that are not listed on widely-recognized exchanges such as the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp) (NYSE). These securities are instead traded through a [broker-dealer network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp), as the securities don't meet the listing requirements of a centralized exchange. In the case of the third market, the securities are exchange-listed, but they are not being traded through the exchange.",Third Market,1.0,1615400780,Striking_Comparison8

Nope, they knew this was going to happen and published it to add to the fire after the hedge funds told them so.

I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t going to be technical.

If you’re scared and nervous that’s what the hedges and funds want.

Here’s me theory.

WE ALMOST SET OFF A SQUEEZE.

I don’t know if it’s a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze but a 40% drop in 25 minutes without a volume spike means the drop was artificial.

Remember that these funds own RH and many of you apes are still on there.

They can see the stop loss orders you have in place.

They are trying to shake the tree to see what comes loose.

So what do we do?

Hold.

Every day this stock gains or is sideways the funds lose millions in interest.

This is a waiting game.

Short gme even more on the way up and buy shares at the same time.

-&gt; sell basically millions of shares in seconds/minutes to drop the price by nearly 50%


-&gt; cover shorts and buy more shares with a hefty profit, then do it again?



Is that about right? Could they do that basically all day long (with the pauses of trading halts obviously?)
