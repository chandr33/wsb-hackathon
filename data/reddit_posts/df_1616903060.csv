10,metz4t,"Hooo boy I just figured out something amazing you dirty apes.  Buckle up because it is story time, you are going to like this one.  This is not a story about GME now, but what we will see happen during the MOASS.  How about a trailer to the movie we are about to see?

**Goldman Sachs and Block Trades**

Our story starts with an oddity someone pointed out to me Friday:  [There was a huge block trade being offered up on the Bloomberg terminal.](https://twitter.com/AnalystDC/status/1375517530723352578).  What is a block trade?  It is when millions of shares are sold at once for a discount because they need to be liquidated for cash.... fast.  Normally this big blocks trade in the dark market to not spook investors and allow big stockholders to exit without causing a panic.  One of the more benign reasons the dark markets exist.

So Goldman Sachs in this case does not actually own the stocks.  They are just selling them on behalf of some mysterious owner and are on the face of it.  Let's dig deeper.

**The Man Behind The Curtain**

If you look at all those stocks, they have one common entity which has enough stock for *all* of those trades: Morgan Stanley.  Not going to post all the links, but MS is in the top 5 holders of every single one and is the only one with enough stock to sell those big of blocks.  Cool, one piece down.  But the thing is, Morgan Stanley's balance sheet doesn't have any reason that they would have to liquidate that much risk.  So who could it be?

Well, Yahoo broke the story - [The Archegos Capital Management hedge fund](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tiger-cub-archegos-liquidation-015109185.html) is the apparent owner of all of those stocks.  It is run by Bill Hwang who used to own Tiger Asia Management (for those looking at other posts, this is the common Hong Kong thread).  Now the thing is, not all hedge funds are necessarily evil, but [Tiger had to shut down](https://www.asiaasset.com/post/3180-news-tiger) due to [insider trading](https://www.nj.com/business/2012/12/tiger_asia_hedge_fund_expected.html).  So fuck'm.  (Credit to /u/the_captain_slog for that find).  Now Archegos' website is down too.   Oh well!

**The Margin Call and QQQ**

So why did they get margin called?  Well, from the above links Archegos is heavily leveraged.  So that means most of their holdings are bought on loan.  There is a capital requirement that they must fulfill in order to have this much leverage as a result of the 2008 crash where some players had 33:1 leverage *cough* bear stearns *cough* and died because of it taking the market with them.  Due to the pandemic, there was a temporary rule put in place saying that the treasury bonds didn't count against that limit.  It ends March 31st.  

So they need a bit of cash, so what?   Well, guess what they also own huge stakes in?  Viacom and Discovery.  These two stocks lost about 50% of their price over the last few days, eliminating another huge portion of Archegos' equity value.  So now their debt/equity ratio is a shitload higher!  

What happens if the ratio gets too high?  The banks come a-callin!  They force the hedge fund to close their leveraged positions and *margin call* them.  This margin call is also what happens to be the mechanism behind a.... **short squeeze!**  Only a short squeeze has many margin calls happening back to back as their debt from short positions skyrockets.

Well, something really odd happened at the end of Friday - the SPY and QQQ ETFs, which are relatively low volatility, climbed up a few percent in the last few hours.  Traders have been super confused on why this happened.  But there is a really easy linkage here that isn't much of a stretch: Archegos was heavily shorting either the ETFs or the underlying stocks!  So what happens when they get margin called?  They have to cover their positions suddenly at whatever price the stock is selling!  Boom goes the stock price.  Well, little boom in this case but it is a mini preview of the MOASS.  This will be happening at a much bigger scale.

Could it have been just normal portfolio rebalancing?  Maybe!  But the timing of this works out really well, and the narrative fits.  

I am not a financial advisor, cat, nor jedi.  This is just a story about some other stocks and not financial advise.","BUCKLE UP - we just saw a hedge fund die this week! A trailer of the MOASS movie, and explaining some weirdness Friday. DD",1.0,1616903745,boneywankenobi

Preface: I research. I learn. I discuss. I've never posted my in deeper DD as I shy away from it. So I wanted to share a work in progress and if I am incorrect please let me know as I only want to publish truth. So if maybe some aid from the smarty apes.

I have unique ways of searching and doing DD. I actually search in reverse; which I wont go into lol its kinda silly. Poking around I came across this banking site that describes a list of companies including Citadel and others as "" **The following firms are believed to presently make a market in ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. stock on the NASDAQ** ""

The website: [Market Makers - ConnectOne Bank](https://ir.connectonebank.com/financial-information/market-makers/default.aspx)

So from there I find an SEC filing, if others more knowledgable on interpretation, and the SEC filing states its for the President of the bank. It appears to be of securities being sold.

I have not done the math yet on the numbers. Thoughts?

Seems to be a bunch of sales...

With this post I'm specifically thinking about the donating of Switches to children's hospitals. Most console donations I've seen so far have been Switch Lite. Why the Switch Lite? They're handheld only, and I feel like that would make multiplayer gaming less convenient than on the full Switch. Am I missing something?

53,meuo2t,"I am thinking of how things could play out in stocks in the market moving forward. Hypothetically, if everyone stopped buying for a week and then aggressively bought when the price hit the bottom, could this cause a gamma squeeze?  This just seems too easy?!?

Hypothetical:

Everyone stops buying for a week. The hedge funds think they have won and get the price around $1. The following Friday(options expiring) everyone starts aggressively  buying again. Since the price would be low there would be more participants. This giant influx of share buyers and options buyers could create a gamma squeeze and depending on short interest, a short squeeze. This ""Synthetic"" squeeze could replicated on any spotlight stock.

There has to be something missing. Options prices still ridiculously high? Too much risk to apes stuck on the $14 branches? I guess essentially, anyone holding in profit could dump(start the down turn) and pile in at the bottom.

The SEC and others have released guidance on a few fronts:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Identify members of the CCP who are board members
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Affidavits affirming that auditing firms are adhering to western standards

These two tidbits has forced several firms (most notably those held/run by the CCP) to decide to divest themselves.  The CCP officers who own/control the firms (or have a directing influence) may not want to be openly identified as board members of Ten Cent or Baidu - so are selling.

That selling may be massive, and as it unwinds, expect the stock market to respond.  When you drop a few billion from Baidu, you also affect other technology firms and potentially ETFs
