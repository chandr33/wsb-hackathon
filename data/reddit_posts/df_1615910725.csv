I also recently learned about [XBOX GAME PASS](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) and today I thought to myself, doesn't GameStop have the most data on used games / which games have been rebought the most?

Today's post by [@GMEshortsqueeze](https://twitter.com/gmeshortsqueeze/status/1371823921566208007?s=21) made me think - isn't it logical for GameStop to have its own 'ULTIMATE GAME PASS' across all consoles where users can pay a monthly subscription to access a bundle of games curated by GameStop's big data?

This would be truly game changing and also reinforce GameStop as an integral partner to all gaming ecosystems, securing passive revenue and digital penetration. This is how GameStop can leverage the worldwide brand loyalty without having to have a physical presence in each city.

12,m6cibd,"I've been watching and participating in this spectacle since late January. I haven't been posting. I lurk on Reddit. I don't post. I do read, however, despite having the comprehension of an ape. The content I've been consuming - the personal stories, the wrinkled-brain analysis, the memes - has been amazing. This truly is a unique community - it's global, inclusive, and (by and large) supportive. It's a great resource for those, like myself, who have jumped into the market with little understanding. GameStop piqued my interest. This community has helped refine that interest into understanding...well, maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of what's going on. So, as an ape who has been lurking and learning, I thank all you apes -- from Cornelius to Zaius, from Grodd to Solovar, and of course King Kong himself, DFV -- you apes run the spectrum, and are on the spectrum. You've helped me, the ape from 2001: A Space Odyssey (I think it's an ape, though maybe a neanderthal - apes can't remember details from films), gather my first investment tools. 

On a related note, I put my retirement account into GME. Pretty high cost basis? No. Not considering what's going to happen in the near future. It's gonna be bananas.

17,m6cjw0,"*Disclaimer for r/WSB: the information to follow is fundamental, factual information regarding price action and order flow that you can verify for yourself in any trading related publication. Anyone in the comments implying otherwise is either ignorant or a shill.

&amp;nbsp;

I've posted this elsewhere in similar form because it is critical information to have for this unique scenario, especially for those of you new to trading.

&amp;nbsp;

There's something that I've not seen mentioned on WSB or GME since all of this started, and I think it's absolutely crucial for everyone to understand. I am actually a bit upset this did not occur to me to post long ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

Best time to plant a tree is 50 years ago, second best yada yada yada, so here it goes.

&amp;nbsp;

What I am referring to is price action. Specifically, the bid/ask spread and how it impacts price movement.

&amp;nbsp;

Price only moves when the spread is crossed, or Market-Makers bring the bid/ask in line with the limit orders on the book to facilitate trade. If you need further explanation, I invite you to do your own research, as the intricacies of the bid/ask spread are not the focus of this post.

&amp;nbsp;

What I really aim to explain here is how the situation with GME is very unique in how trading it should be approached compared to other stocks that do not have an imminent MOASS.

&amp;nbsp;

Typically, you want to pay the *best price* (lowest) for a stock that you are interested in, right? Buy low, sell high, after all. Unless you are FOMO'ing in with a panicked market order, you will set a limit order at or below the current price to get in, and you will wait and more than likely be filled soon after, unless you set your limit much lower than the current bid.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a perfectly normal and advisable means of entering a regular trade. It gets you in position, and since you are not a whale, your position is not going to have a meaningful impact on direction.

&amp;nbsp;

HOWEVER, if you were a whale, and your position *could* have a significant impact on direction, you'd want to swing that weight. How do you do that? You cross the bid ask/spread, or you put in a market order. A market order opens you up to potential catastrophe if your size is big enough to eat through the order book, so the wiser choice is to set a limit order at *the highest price you are willing to pay* and punch it, Chewy. Your order will then be filled from the best (lowest) sell orders on the book on up to your limit price if there are not enough orders on the book to keep it away from your limit, et voila, the price of the stock is now higher as it came up to meet your order.

&amp;nbsp;

This is how big players are able to move the market. Are you beginning to piece together why this information is critical to the GME situation, especially with incoming STIMMIES?

&amp;nbsp;

Now I am not saying *we* should do anything, as this is not financial advice, but I am sharing what *I* intend to do on my next purchase (current position 60 shares (added 9 shares after my first post) @$204 average, 1 3/19 800C.) 

&amp;nbsp;

I am going to apply upward pressure upon the price by setting my limit order ABOVE the ask. This normally inadvisable approach makes perfect sense here, because I know where the price can go on this monster and HFs want DOWNWARD price pressure, and I will not give it to them.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Setting orders above the ask applies upward pressure to the price. Setting a bid order below the bid applies downward pressure. Being cheap and trying to get the *best price* on GME is silly considering the potential and that anything under $1k/share is a bargain in my eyes. Upward banana good, downward banana bad.

But I’m pretty bullish on HMSO, and here is why:

HMSO is currently trading at around \~£40, after tanking from a highs of about \~£3000 back in their heyday, further compounded by the impacts of coronavirus on the retail sector. And this is why I believe they're due a resurgence fellow degens (I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice) 🔨🔨🔨

&amp;#x200B;

[Look at all that red lol](https://preview.redd.it/bwlduwj70fn61.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17de9f0eef652c79f8f150b35db322e23b68ca90)

***Overview 🔨***

“We create vibrant, continually evolving spaces, in and around thriving cities, where people and brands want to be.

We seek to deliver value for all our stakeholders and to create a positive and sustainable impact for generations to come.” (source: [https://www.hammerson.com/about/](https://www.hammerson.com/about/)) 

**1) Rita-Rose Gagne 🔨**

Ms Gagne replaced the previous CEO David Atkins, and brings a new vision for Hammerson’s future growth. She’s stated that in the short term her priorities are creating a “path to safety”, but is also looking to innovate the company’s services by simplifying its portfolio, reducing debt and creating new ways to engage customers post coronavirus. 

As a Sky News article states: “Longer term, Ms Gagne said Hammerson had not responded rapidly enough to changing consumer habits and not managed its assets to create locations that felt ""dynamic and relevant"" to visitors. She said an ""innovative management approach"" would be needed in which Hammerson worked more closely with its blue-chip partners. That means reconfiguring the portfolio and repurposing assets as the company seeks to respond to changing shopper habits.” ([https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-bullring-owner-hammerson-eyes-more-shopping-centre-sales-as-it-bleeds-red-12243838](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-bullring-owner-hammerson-eyes-more-shopping-centre-sales-as-it-bleeds-red-12243838))

She brings something new to HMSO: a new vision for an ailing and sluggish British property corporate. 

**2) Retail trends 🔨**

As in-person shopping returns post-lockdown, it’s likely we’ll witness an increase in brick and mortar retail activity, which bodes well for HMSO’s performance (namely rent collection from stores that have been dormant in their shopping centres, more information on this here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hammerson-collects-41-of-rents-pays-down-debt-2021-01-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hammerson-collects-41-of-rents-pays-down-debt-2021-01-19))

The outlook for retailers has got better though. Signs of a pick-up in retail are visible already, even though we are only in the first phase of a lockdown easing programme. In the UK. retailers are slated to reopen from April 12 onwards. This should improve some prospects for shopping malls further.

The Centre for Retail Research estimated that by the end of 2021, retail sales would still be lower than in 2019 – but by 2022, retail sales should have recovered (https://www.retailresearch.org/retail-forecast.html).

On the other hand, the KPMG/Ipsos Retail Think Tank was cautiously optimistic, highlighting how pent up savings and demand, improved consumer confidence, and a successful vaccine rollout would all help to support the recovery of UK retail – especially in the second half of the year ([https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2021/01/retail-think-tank-upbeat-uk-retail-health-second-half-2021/](https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2021/01/retail-think-tank-upbeat-uk-retail-health-second-half-2021/))

Growth forecasts for 2021 and 2022 have been upped recently for the UK. Economists are bullish on consumer spending in the foreseeable future, going by existing pent-up demand. There is also some speculation that we are in for a decade of high growth, which could mean a boom for many consumer-linked businesses.

**3) Board reshuffle 🔨**

Out with the old – in with the new: the board is due for a reshuffle later this month which will see more new blood introduced. (More on this here: [https://www.retailsector.co.uk/615694-hammerson-confirms-board-reshuffle/](https://www.retailsector.co.uk/615694-hammerson-confirms-board-reshuffle/))

**4) Diversification 🔨**

HSMO is looking to diversify from just retail space / shopping centres to residential property, as demonstrated by their decision to convert the former Debenhams flagship store in Leicester in Housing. 

Mark Bourgeois, Hammerson’s UK and Ireland managing director, said: ""Since opening its doors in 2008, Highcross has firmly established itself as an integral part of Leicester’s city core.

""While the structural shift in retail and changing consumer shopping habits have meant that destinations such as Highcross need to adapt their offer and mix of uses, well-connected city centre locations such a this will always be places where people want to be.""

Here are the last 3 spikes - Jan, Feb, Mar (current). January resulted in a long period of decline, while the February one came back strong. But outside of the follow-up, all squeezes seem similar ins tructure. Is this a typical pattern, does it have a name?",Let's talk about patterns on the GME,1.0,1615911872,Dwarf_Vader

99,m6cx69,"Honestly this whole situation with GME, C and such has been beautiful. I love all of you who are sticking it to Hedge funds. 

It's been even more beautiful to see what some of you do to keep morale up, or use your gains to help children's hospitals, gorilla foundation and stuff. Honestly the best thing about 2020 and 2021. 

However... WSB was about getting the tendies, not about fighting big investing firms. Discovering new stocks and selling fast. You know: making an actual bet and winning or losing money on it.

Am I the crazy dude here? Shouldn't we make a separate subreddit focused on fucking up big hedgies and using the gains for some actual good in the world? Cause it sure seems kinda different and all posts lately (as much as I really enjoy them) are about GME and AMC. There's plenty more stocks out there.

Just my stupid opinion I guess... I just want more content about actual WS bets and I would love this whole war on the hedgies to go on but the latter drowns up the content for the former",Unpopular opinion: WSB is no longer about WSB,1.0,1615911905,alclab
