They sent me an email today stating the reason as why they restricted my account. Either I have a negative balance or a failed bank transfer to Robinhood. Which is neither. Also in that email they said I can still deposit funds....

Ok, now with that out of the way....

The DD seems solid on RKT and seems to mirror GME right before the first big run. Congrats to u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT on his huge YOLO. However, all I hear is that it's a distraction or Shitadel P&amp;D. Don't get me wrong, I'm still HODLing 15k GME for the moon but how isn't this getting more support? Out of 1.98 billion shares, there are only 200k shares available per IBorrowDesk and a reported short float of 37.47% by FINRA.

This tweet from Ihor @ S3 went out earlier today claiming that the short float has now increased to 45.15% and is his top candidate for a squeeze.

Top 3 rules in hockey

1. Protect your goalie
2. Don’t fuck with the goalie
3. Don’t fucking touch the goalie.

Let’s consider this sub a rink and u/zjz the crazy, vicodin chewing tender that you absolutely do not fuck with. Mod team integrity has been more than proven by this point. To that end, [""I gotta say man, it sucks to be the guys that didn't sell out who have to carry all the baggage while the sellout dickbags get rich cr\*pto scamming and selling movie rights.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwoys5/something_isnt_right/gpim6yv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Hey u/spez, what’s a guy gotta do to get a cushy tech job with fat bonuses and daily z-jobs? Maybe diamond dicking his way through one of the company's most tumultuous moments (**in THIS fucking subreddit of all fucking places**) should be a good resume bullet point?

Money is being won and lost, people are going to get heated but something to keep in mind; in January some of the most powerful, wealthiest companies on the planet got fucked with. You didn’t think they’d hit back? Wouldn't hire psyops consultants to come in here and spread confusion and division? Bull traps, bear traps, shills, bots - they're all here. The only thing you can do is assess the legitimacy of each post/poster. The more effective method of damaging ""public opinion"" isn’t siphoning off information, it’s turning on a metaphorical firehose of info until it gets difficult to tell fact from fiction. Also worth noting ""conflict"" can be bot on bot action. Their job is to create noise.

**TL;DR - Shit is only going to get rougher, WS hedgies will play dirty and we’re gonna need a proper tender to keep it clean. Quit running your cock holsters, ease up on the booger sugar or balance with a xanny, and do your fucking job by downvoting and reporting obvious bots/shills.**

Edit: sp, and stop giving me awards. You guys either love hockey, the mods, or hate money",Don't fuck with the goalie.,0.82,1614810825,Batman__I__am

71,lx66zq,"Discovery is up over 100% in the past few months and I see hardly anything about it online (except for things like \[this ""thinkpiece""\]([https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307034/discovery-plus-ambient-tv-hgtv-food-tlc-house-hunters-90-day-fiance-diners-driveins-dives](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307034/discovery-plus-ambient-tv-hgtv-food-tlc-house-hunters-90-day-fiance-diners-driveins-dives)). There're like three posts on this sub with &gt;50 upvotes, but otherwise its just crazy to me that a company can have this massive of a change in stock price with basically nobody talking about it online (I could be blind but it's nowhere I've looked). Maybe its on CNBC?? I avoid that channel like the plague so I wouldn't know. It was up another 4% today. Any reason? Nope. Just another day on the Discovery Channel.

It could be that ""HURR DURR STREAMING MARKET SATURATED,"" but Discovery's shows are super cheap to produce, plus it has a huge catalog of content people fuckin love to watch. They don't need to break the bank making prestige stuff or pay expensive licensing fees, they just keep cranking out awesome garbage. The company still has a low PE ratio compared to anything else nowadays too. Oh also it has some random Burry stuff going on and that seems like it works out alot.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: I bought in at the peak and I'm up 20% but I'm gonna hold until HGTV prints me a house. I wrote this so I could tell a Wendy's about my gambling problem.
