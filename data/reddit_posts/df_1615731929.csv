30,m4w73k,"I am not a financial advisor and the below is my personal assessment of how things could unfold in the coming few months/quarters. And based on my assessment, I have tried to draw up a plan which I think might work in generating decent return with low to medium portfolio downside risk. This is not particularly a WSB-ish post, just because I am trying to not go full retard with my money.

Assumptions:
1. Fed to keep interest rate low till 2023
2. More fiscal spend in the coming months involving trillions of dollars

Let me start by saying that we don't need to figure out whether we will have inflation in the near future or not. Let the bond market speculate on that. We just need to follow the bond market and its expectation of inflation. That's all we need to do in order to allow ourselves a better chance to make money right now.

If the bond market's inflation expectation goes up from here, so will the 10Y yield. If the bond market's expectation of inflation goes down or remain as it is right now, the 10Y will remain where it is or will go down.

Note: at 1.6 yield (current yield) one would only buy a 10Y if they estimate that long term inflation is going to be less than 1.6.

If the yield goes up from here, tech or broadly speaking Nasdaq will continue to struggle further. And value stocks such as financials, energy companies, consumer discretionary will continue to outperform.

If yield remains where it is, expect tech to bounce back in the medium term, but value stocks will still remain the favorites.

If yield goes down, which would be a surprise, tech will climb back rapidly and value stocks will probably experience a correction, since they have already run up a lot in the last few months.

I personally think there is a greater chance of yield going higher from here, so being in value stocks or reopening stocks makes more sense to me.

However, since there is always the off chance that we experience runaway inflation, I think it would just be wise to hold perhaps 15% of your portfolio in inflation hedges such as REIT, or in a commodity ETF.

If real inflation actually rises in the next couple of quarters, Fed might or might not raise interest rates immediately.

If Fed doesn't raise interest rates and lets inflation run up, it might do so because the Fed might believe it is a short term phenomenon. Anyway, if inflation does run hot above 2% targeted, expect 10Y to shoot up.

In a higher than expected inflation environment, equities usually underperform, historically. Tech definitely would not be the place to be in. Safe bets would involve: consumer staples, energy and utility companies. These are considered safe because these industries could pass on their costs to the consumer, so their operating margin doesn't get impacted. Financials would also do well if this scenario plays out, because their net interest income would improve, because of steepening yield curve.

Commodities should also outperform during this scenario because high inflation will drive up the prices of agricultural products, livestock products - gold and silver will become attractive as store of value, property prices will go up (REIT).

In this scenario perhaps you should start building position in the dollar (cash) and also be equally weighted between commodities/property and stocks (financials/utilities/consumer staple).

If Fed raises interest rate as a response to rising inflation, it will do so because Fed wants to cool down the overheating economy.

In this scenario of rising interest rates, expect dollar to bottom and for it to surge as long as interest rates remain high. Commodities and REIT will underperform. Stocks will experience stagnate return or maybe even a bear market. If so, your built up cash position in dollar should probably go into buying the dip of attractive companies.","Portfolio plan for the months/quarters ahead | in context of yield, inflation and interest rates (Open to criticism if you think I am wrong or disagree)",1.0,1615732684,manofculture003
