My analysis is that GME has to go up over 480 because
1. It came down 95% 
2. The only way to moon is over. 
3. Every day close price is higher than the previous 
4. Maybe every one is tricking the suspend switch this time at Saving Elite Crowd by going it slow as an airplane rather than as a rocket. Comfy rides are a plus. 
5. The business goals and the team looks amazing and might have impactful earnings due to the release of PS5 and XBOX in Q4 and now the actual digital transformation news

DISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline. 
The 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!
So, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors.  Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).  
Anyway, I see so many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all.  Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 to 5 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits. 

The issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today.  The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable.  So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were “high risk”, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.
I think there are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a long time ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough.  So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete.  $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises.  Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.   
When I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business. 
Business modelHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers. Global Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax. 
So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. 
Who are their customers and where are they know?5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too.  This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk.  Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.  
What are the growth drivers?Acquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business.  When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network.  Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem. 
What are the revenues of the business? Company estimates. 2020  $346mm*2021 $432 mm*2022 $540 mmWhat do I think actually happens?2020 $350 to $400mm2021 $450 to $550mm2022 $600 to $700mmWhy?  Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don’t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.  
What does that say about valuation? Well, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being “conservative” let’s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK. 
2020  $346mm  Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21 *2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share. *2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share. 
If you used my estimates it would be the following2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $292022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84Given the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet. 
What do I think the future holds for Payoneer?I actually think there are several exits for this company. 1.	Company continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player).  So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside. 2.	Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company.  Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.  Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. 3.	Wildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM’s have been changing the game.  First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction.  They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow. Conclusion:  $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.  If you like my analysis please share with other people and if you want me to look at a company and provide an analysis like this I can do that for a small fee. Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are.
