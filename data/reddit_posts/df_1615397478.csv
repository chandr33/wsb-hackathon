18,m233cp,"Elixinol Global (EXL on the ASX) and (ELLXF in the US) is a global CBD brand. Last Wednesday the company entered a trade halt in Australia on the ASX. The reason for the halt was listed as a ""potential transaction"". Here is the definition for a potential transaction: [https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/potential-transaction](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/potential-transaction)

and here is the trade halt announcement.

[https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02349848-2A1285005?access\_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02349848-2A1285005?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)

The stock has not traded now for 5 trading days on the ASX yet it continues to trade in the U.S. Markets while awaiting news of the ""potential transaction"". The stock is currently trading at $.17 in U.S. dollars with a book value of around $.70 - $.75.

The company changed management last year and is steering the company towards profitability. Here are a couple recent articles:
