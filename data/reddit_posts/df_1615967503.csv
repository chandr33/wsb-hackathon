1,m6v7ag,"Hi All.

I have to admit, when I first heard about you Apes, sticking it to the hedgies, I joined reddit specifically to witness it all unfold. 

As I checked in daily to witness the carnage, I noticed a bit more than I had anticipated. I was expecting to see some sort of coordination or disciplined strategy, instead, i found absolute bedlam, but without mallace. Just some people trying to play the game that has been out of reach for the little guys for decades.

I found myself reading more and more of the posts, picking up little tid bits of info about something I have absolutely no clue about. STONKS.

I'm not gonna lie, I still don't really have that much of an idea, but it's getting better. The more I check in, the more I see, which is fun.

So this is just a brief thanks from me, it's been a wild ride and I'm sure will continue.

Cheers WSB!",To WSB.,1.0,1615967677,ScaryParticular9418

   I don‚Äôt think you guys really understand the significance of this fight. Yes. There will be a lot of money to be made. But looking past the money, when we get to the end of this, America will really become the land of the FREE! Imagine. A life with no student loans, no mortgage, and no car notes. Nothing Other than excitement for the coming day keeping you up at night. To be truly Free! This is what this war is about.       
   Big banks have lured many into their illusion of freedom enslaving many for generations; we have seen now that they control the media so our narrative on freedom have been scripted to their benefit. But the tides are turning! Technology has shone a BRIGHT light in the darkness they have kept us in for centuries. And now it is UP TO US TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY to reclaim our freedom. WE BUY, AND WE MOTHER FUCKING HOLD!!! 
  Think about it. Why do you think they are fighting so hard? They know that losing this war will break open the flood gates which they have put in place to control our progress. They also know that this war will usher in A NEW ERA!  One where we will see currency FULLY decentralized, monopolistic capitalist strongholds crumble and be replaced with a more human centric, and earth conscious leaders. One where humanity can truly shine forth (we seen so Many examples of humanitarian acts just off the little gains we‚Äôve seen so far) and address issues of our planet. Hedgies are fighting so hard because in this new world, they would be punished for all their crimes against humanity. So they are fighting for their lives!! But this is an uphill battle for them that is slowly coming to a devastating and climatic END! 
   Now knowing what is at stake here, and knowing what you have to do to create that future for yourself and for your legacy, I HOPE YOU ARE AS AMPED UP AS I AM!!  I have been through so much uncertainty in my life. So much hardship. But what has kept me going is the belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel And giving up now only means I will never get to see that light. Using that mindset in this war, I SEE THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE AND ALL I NEED TO DO TO BASK IN THAT LIGHT IS TO HOLD THROUGH A FEW MORE UPS AND DOWNS! 
    Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will stop me from getting to that light. I deserve that light my generation deserves that light. WE All deserve that light. it‚Äôs our right as human beings to live in that light and all we have to do to get there is FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!

The stock currently trades at near all time low (83$) as of typing this. Trading started back in dec 2020 at 42$ IPO price valuation (Lockup until June 2021) and it did shoot up to 170$+ before the recent dumping along with tech stocks. Company has no debt &amp; plenty of cash 900m+, latest earnings didn't impress wallstreet (19% increase) [https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx).

Artificial intelligence industry is massive and expected to grow. The total addressable market for artificial intelligence was a massive $40B in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.2% reaching $737.7B by 2027. To put AI in comparison with PLTR, AI currently sits at 8.3B marketcap while PLTR is circa 46.6B.

Recently, AI &amp; Infor formed a partnership: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html) which will expose AI to massive amount of new customers. It is worth to note that current AI customers are few. However, they are huge and every contract is worth millions ex. Baker Hughes. Basically, every new customer at AI brings in massive growth and revenue. I expect this partnership to accelerate AI's revenue and open up for new streams.

Another worth mention point is that AI have also worked with Raytheon on an aircraft readiness program with U.S. Army Aviation, potentially leading the door to other high-profile public sector engagements.

There has been recent insider trade activity which was mainly selling at 85-95$ range which I think provided a very good entry for new traders. Note analysts have this stock as Hold, see some of these analysts targets: Piper Sandler &gt; Overweight 141$ Canaccord Genuity &gt; Hold 120$ Needham &amp; Company &gt; Buy 195$ 

It is hard to chart a recently traded stock but I believe AI stock is trading at a critical support level in which if breaks will provide unique opportunity to accumulate (IF). It is best to enter this stock with dollar cost average strategy in place so if you end up buying at the current level, make sure to keep some buying power in case we go to the 70s range.

For me, this will be one of the best risk to reward ratio printers if tech stocks reverse back up. You can check TradingView [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/) and see that your entry will be lesser than most other traders (Most bought in the 90s and 100s range) but please DYOR as usual and only trade what you can afford to lose, best of luck üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ.",Quick DD on $AI &amp; the potential upside üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ,1.0,1615968581,religionresearcher

**Maxar Technologies DD**

Background  
 It's space stock trading at a market cap \~$3B with &gt;$1.7B in yearly revenue and $0.3B net profit ,2020 got hit really hard after a series of bad situations which was pretty much the perfect storm: downturn in large satellite contracts, short sell attack, high debt, potential dividend elimination, satellite failure, trouble in liquidating part of business (GEO), transition from Canadian to US based forcing big Canadian holders to sell.

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $45 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors. 

The Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.

Read here an interview with the CEO Dan Jablonsky about Worldview-Legion, which will be their new constellation of imagery satellites scheduled for launch in early 2021. Right now Capex is high due to this project but this will drive tremendous free cash flow if successful. Margins on their imagery results are 60.5%! https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview (https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview/)/

They received a $375M NASA contract to build part of NASA's Lunar Gateway, this clearly displays NASA's continued support and belief in MAXAR: http://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Maxar-Selected-to-Build-Fly-First-Element-of-NASAs-Lunar-Gateway/default.aspx

Value Speculation Side:

1. The industry is also rapidly growing and is expected to reach $3 Trillion in 30 years [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/the-space-industry-will-be-worth-nearly-3-trillion-in-30-years-bank-of-america-predicts.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/the-space-industry-will-be-worth-nearly-3-trillion-in-30-years-bank-of-america-predicts.html)  
   
 

2.  Maxar wins $142 million NASA robotics mission, which means it could gain from NASA if the space competition being more active  
 [https://spacenews.com/maxar-wins-142-million-nasa-robotics-mission/](https://spacenews.com/maxar-wins-142-million-nasa-robotics-mission/)

3. Sale of the MDA Business, Reduced indebtedness and leverage, given over $500 million in liquidity, and Shifting from Industrial to Data Service Oriented by Acquisition  
 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005850/en/Maxar-Technologies-Completes-Acquisition-of-Vricon-Inc](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005850/en/Maxar-Technologies-Completes-Acquisition-of-Vricon-Inc).

Catalyst Side:

1. Strong Catalyst - Front Run Arkx  
 Arkx launch could come March 29 at the earliest, ARKX is the space theme ETF managed be Cathie Wood (well known for her disruptive innovation fund ARKK this year)  
 [https://www.etf.com/sections/blog/arks-next-etf-nears-landing?nopaging=1](https://www.etf.com/sections/blog/arks-next-etf-nears-landing?nopaging=1)

2. Said ARKK Avg P/E Ratio: 52.9 and Avg Price/Book Ratio: 15.31, this stock will range from $203 to $264

3. Short Interest 8.3%

Technical Side:

üì∑

1. Nice Volatility contraction recently, great range to accumulate in range.

2. In technical view, upside will be the highest of the triangle minus the lowest of the triangle times 2, which short term target will be $85 - $90

All in all think this is the perfect setup and I'm Long. Who will ride this to the Moon with me?

63,m6w73a,"Disclaimer: I have no DD, but I think it‚Äôd explain why they exploited the loophole of finding a new way to keep shorting and driving prices down during SSR, knowing there‚Äôs a potential fine in it for them. I‚Äôd call that doubling down.

Being said, I‚Äôve got my ten shares because that‚Äôs all I can afford, and I‚Äôm holding until it changes my life. Not being a shill, check my comment history. Just had a thought by accident and want to encourage continued diamond hands if I‚Äôm right and pray to the moon rocket gods I‚Äôm wrong.

Question.

And I‚Äôve been up for two days, but I was thinking. Conspiracy theory level, but this is what I would do if I‚Äôm a fucked billionaire (among other things, like sleep at night instead of learning about stocks). 

Theory: Intentional short to drive prices down to encourage stimulus buying, so your trees get fresh fruit when you shake them after bombing it with shorts again, allowing you to, theoretically, either cover a bit with fresh fruit, or in hopes of bombing it back down far and/or fast enough to hope to shake off some extra diamond hands?

We‚Äôve been calling them stupid, but tbh we all know they‚Äôre not. That‚Äôs our fucking job in this mess. Seems like a fair, logical move that would blindside us because we accused ignorance instead of malice. Which gives me a headache.",Question about HF future plays,1.0,1615971932,Minimoose91

Hey guys! $SENS, a company working on a revolutionary new diabetes CGM (continuous glucose monitor) just got a patent after hours yesterday, meaning big moves today! This penny has been gaining in traction and has around 40% short float. Lots of buy orders went through late AH yesterday also, with lots of consolidation in the week prior. I think this is the catalyst this guy has been waiting for! I‚Äôve done my DD, if you curious do yours also! Calls are crazy cheap, 3.50 currently only .01! Keep a watch on this guyüëÄ
