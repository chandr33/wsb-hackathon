8,m3xpko,"Alright. 

Here's my theory of how things work with GME short squeeze.

HF shorted GME a lot. Lets say 1mil shorts at $13 (I have no idea about any quantity), so they gained $ 13 000 000

When price is around $265, they'd lose 20x by covering their shorts... so they can't cover.

Price went up to $400 or so. They shorted a bunch, say another 1mil. Their average gain was, lets say, $250 per share. So they gained 250 \*1mil = $250 000 000. total gain is $263 000 000. Because they bought more shorts, their average short has gotten higher. Now it's at $131,5 2 million shares.

They buy back 1mil shares at $100 average during the crash and during those $40 days... Their total money is also $163 mil.

Then price rocketed up to average say $250. Now buying 1mil shares at that price would already go over their budget, because 163 - 250 = -87. Of course, if they suddenly started buying back shares the price would sky rocket, unless they do this over a very long period of time.

But, then another short happened.... at 345. So, maybe they gained 1 mil shorts at average of $240. Bringing their average up to $185,75. total amount of money is now at $349 mil.

So now the market value is around $265/ share... So, to cover 2mil shares at that cost, it'd cost them 349 - 530 = - $181 mil... So, they actually shot put themselves in a worse position, even though their average short value went up (and therefore easier to cover).

Ok it's getting very late and I can't fully think this through... But, isn't the important thing to just keep the stock at this high value???? Or, cause spikes in price causing HF to short more, but then it being absolutely crucial that the dip is bought up very quickly?? Although upping their short average, but also increasing the amount of shorts they have to cover?

I think I'm starting to get the point here, even though I have no clue about the actual numbers. However... if they covered their $13 shorts earlier this thing would absolutely not work. The bet I guess... is that their $13 shorts are still there. Then there's the slow interest rate on the shorts, but it seems sort of insignificant, don't think there's any way people could hold this for years.",I think I understand what this short squeeze is about!

Some retarded dd:  GME moved between $4 to $5 for a span of 6 months before then moving between $7 to $11 from Sep to Nov. It wasn't until Dec that it stayed above $20. - that's 4 months range just to get to $20 b4 it went to 40, 60, 80,.... 400+.

AMC is now breaking that $11-$12 range (by breaking I mean staying above 10-11) that's huge! Like my wife's boyfriend's dick huge.

$20 is the next goal... So who the fak are you to say AMC can't reach the moon?

Look at the charts independently... the yearly not day and minutes. For fuck sake some of you need to start doing your own dd otherwise you'll be back broke as fast as you're rich.

AMC did not have a short squeeze - their short float did not drop substantially back in late Jan like GME did. - instead they had what might have been a small gamma but that shit is common with shorted stocks as options expire every Friday some more than others. So you'll at times see big spikes if it was a big date and ITM. 

So what you saw in Jan was not ohh... AMC only went up to $20 GME hit $480 so I'm going to do dumb ape math and say AMC can't get to 480 because in Jan it only went to 20.

I hardly ever use it, but I use my Rokus (Roki?) all the time for Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, etc.  First, it has an incredibly simple interface, and the apps published on the Roku system have far superior interfaces than those on other streaming devices (Chromecast, Firestick, etc.).  Second, the network connectivity is far superior to any of those other devices.  The only thing I've found that comes close to giving me the same stutter-free streaming of a Roku is a Mac Book Pro.

What if GameStop, along with being a e-commerce business, builds its own streaming platform for pro gamers. I feel like they would absolutely dominate the market at that point. Or if they only stream to show off the latest games giving twitch streamers the opportunity to not only play the new games but show them off. Does that make sense to anyone else? If this has been said or spoken about already my bad I’m lit af and I’m def not reading rn lol it is interesting to see what they will do though. Anyway, feel free to share your thoughts comments or memes or whatever the fuck you want. Make me laugh lol love y’all diamond handed apes!",GameStop what if,1.0,1615607185,boosteds2k99

These trades were in order to minimize the risk in existing positions of stocks I really Fcuking like. In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze???? Is there anyone with more 🧠 wrinkles that could explain: what that means; how it could affect the ongoing squeeze; and why reducing a professional Market Makers’ risk is being given priority over their own customer’s risk? 🦍 🦍🦍🦍

Makes sense to me to take a stock currently at $20.50 and take it wherever you think it can go. Shit, how much free advertising does Wendy's get in this community? Just a random thought, obviously no one should ever take my advice on anything.",One Question----,1.0,1615607238,Reederman35
