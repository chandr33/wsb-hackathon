In the meanwhile, panic selling is caused among the paper hands. Since they have ALL the info, the Hedge Funds can easily get the price back down while making a profit and leave us holding the bag.

65,m5sxoq," 

I'm buying a lot of put spreads of GME, betting the Stock won't hold the 160-200 level in the long term. I don't know about tomorrow or next week, but in the next month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The price has to fall back to where it belongs to. I don't know if it's 20 or 40, or 60. I'm sure it's not 160 after the likely scenario that the company will announce a secondary after earning. Betting with a put spread has no risk except what you have put in. GME can still go higher in the short term, but long term? It seems like free money to me.

I'm showing a small part of my position here. I bet on the long side for the squeeze before, looking at the volume, it's about time to profiting from these Apes once again so they can go back to their zoo after losing all of their money.

This is not financial advice, and I'm betting GME will go lower from here.

This is a continuation from my other post. [Pt 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll68pc/the_sec_just_posted_the_new_numbers_for_failure/)  I wrote a [pt 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvf0uv/the_sec_just_posted_the_new_numbers_for_failure/) but the gay mods never approved it.

Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for a lot of weeks now.   This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act  (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.   This is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.  Why is this being allowed, why was this not brought up at the hearings?

From the SEC regarding this data

&gt;""The     figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that    includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.      In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a   specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to   yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

&gt;In     order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the     restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified     fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.      Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold     securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for     a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

&gt;As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,    the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver   position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule   203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with   large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

I  have a super super small position in GME, like 3 shares and 3 800  calls. Because, yolo.  I am NOT a financial advisor.
