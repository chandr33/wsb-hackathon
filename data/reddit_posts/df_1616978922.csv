- ARKX (space ETF) is listing this week, over the weekend they have amended their prospectus language to allow buying into SPACs (VACQ is not yet merged with Rocket Lab). IMO, this is no coincidence, and Cathie is likely licking her chops at VACQ at these prices.
- Low market valuation relative to peers (i.e SpaceX is already at lofty valuation, leaving less room for price growth).
- Proven ability to get to orbit. 19 or 20 successful launches, with 100+ satellites in orbit.
- Small rockets aren’t a limitation, but actually provide greater flexibility with launch dates, and more granular orbit positions for customer satellites (and I’ve read that 98% of satellites would be able to fit on electron, but I need to find the link that references this).
- Plans to use SPAC money to fund larger ‘Neutron’ rocket, being built for human space flight.

60,mff9o1,"First, I hope I flaired this correctly. Please remove if I'm violating any rules.

So I don't know much (like at all) but have been following AMC and GME since January. I'm pretty new to trading so I hope these aren't dumb questions.

1. I'm getting paid on Wednesday. A lot of people are probably getting paid on Wednesday as it's the end of the month. I'm definitely buying more AMC/GME. **If enough people had the same mindset, would there be any squeeze-related consequences? Would it be possible that this acts as a catalyst?**
2. My general impression has been that if AMC &amp; GME squeeze, AMC will likely squeeze first (not sure I've heard anyone directly say that, but all the hype seems to be for the next few weeks, whereas GME's hype seems to be over the next few months. who knows. I'm probably wrong). Now, hypothetically, if AMC were to squeeze first I would think that a lot of people would be cashing out on their new fortunes. Since these two stocks are so closely tied, I'd also expect a lot of that liquidation go towards buying more GME in anticipation for that potential squeeze. **Is this a likely scenario, and if so, what consequences might it have on AMC and our endgame?**",wondering a couple things moving into this week,1.0,1616983101,elttirb
