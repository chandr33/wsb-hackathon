6. They're also heavily undervalued. Currently going for around the $8 price range; The fair value analysis is between $19.34 - $40.00. 
7. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.
8. Short interest is very high. Over the last 2 weeks, the short interest volume % has been between 28% - 31%. The latest short interest information from general market analysis companies are dated as of 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock had a dividend payout on 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82 (The shorts must cover that as well), so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC. 
9. Major market analyst rate $UWMC as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.
10. This is both a good short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to reach it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride. Plus, it has a dividend of %4.82, or $0.10 per share quarterly. I'm not a big fan of dividends, but I know a lot of investors are.

Throughout the year, there's been a bunch of selloffs from executives at PetQ with the most recent being Friday, March 12 for shares worth over $100M. The shares in the most recent selloff were the exact same so I'm not sure if it was registered twice for the same entity or not, that may be the more likely scenario anyway. But regardless, that's a lot of money. There's also the consideration that these selloffs were scheduled and forced to prevent insider trading, but considering the large spread between each of them makes me think unlikely.

38,m5z159," THIS IS A REPOST FROM USER [u/AJDillonsMiddleLeg](https://www.reddit.com/user/AJDillonsMiddleLeg/) BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD READ 

I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

\*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.\*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons.

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.
2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.*

Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.
2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.
2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

- Forgotten Action Camera Hardware King
- $GPRO has a classic stock bust market history with units peaking almost immediately
after IPO in in the Summer of 2014 and despite extreme sports brand had never really
transitioned from pure consumer hardware commodity story
- GoPro has been pivoting to a DTC model w/subscriptions so as to improve and grow
brand experience with customer and their overall financial model
- This pivot/transformation has been occurring against the backdrop of a global pandemic
and thus gotten very little attention as even dominant outdoor/travel-oriented
businesses were out of favor for most of 2020
- The end of the pandemic combined with the progress they have made so far has created
an intriguing investment opportunity

### Past Narrative Issues

- Stock was an extremely overhyped IPO which quickly ran into Icarus type issues as units
peaked 12 months after 2014 listing
- Iphone/Samsung camera improvements and integration around ecosystem have
continued to chip away at stand-alone camera use cases in the action/adventure space
- Attempted IPO multiple justification via diversification into media company with
streaming and broader content also didn't pan out
- Drone adventure crashed and burned.

### Covid Transformation

- GoPro leveraged the pandemic to transform their distribution model and overall
commoditized camera hardware only identity
- Cameras mix has shifted from single digit DTC to 33% in 2020 with a guide for 40% in
2021 and 50%+ longer term
- Introduced subscription model to drive mix shift and improve model economics around
sticky vertical and drove significant subscriber growth with Hero 9 bundling. Company
exited 2020 w 761K SUBS (52% sequential growth &amp;145% yr/yr) and has guided for 2ml
exit by end 2021
- Company is introducing revamped app to tie all the pieces together in organization,
editing, and sharing of photos/videos. App will be rolled out to 5m' monthly existing
users for $10/yr and offered free to subscribers
- Recent changes drove favorable mix shift (90% 2020 rev and 80% units came from
cameras w $300+ msrp) and $200 million in operating cashflow in H2 2020

### New Investment Narrative

- Stronger financial model w/ bundled camera subscriptions driving improved margins
and cash flow from enthusiast customer base
- Improved brand connectivity from subscriptions with customer data and personalization
allowing for enhanced direct marketing capabilities
- New growth opportunities w Gen Z on the back of the end of Covid action/outdoor
refresh, a new open app experience, and strong Youtube channel presence

### Potential Outcomes

- Stock trades to $23 or 17x my estimated 2021 year -end EV/FCF by June
- Possible bluesky- GoPro adds 3ml+ subs on global reopen refresh in travel/leisure and
becomes open up momo darling. Stock trades $40 or 20x my forecasted EBITDA
- Bear Reopen Scenario (assumes no Covid revival)- GoPro finishes 2020 with just under
2ml subs and the multiple doesn't expand. Stock peaks by Independence Day and finds a
fair value closer to $15 for most of 2021

### Risks

- Subscriber churn proves to be far greater than expected for bundled camera purchasers
by year end
- New App launch is delayed
- Covid-19 returns in a far more deadly form within a few months and crushes the global
travel/outdoor refresh cycle before it gets going",$GPRO Investment Thesis,1.0,1615862537,jayohhh

69,m5z8j4,"RKT ipo'd at $19 back in August.  The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.

They didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.

The Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  

The biz:

Banks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have ""civilized"" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  

Its really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  

Morgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.

These 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  

But the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.

Hedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  

Stonk is at $26

The Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  

RKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans

They don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they ""service"" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.

They missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.

The company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.  

Being number 1 and having great reviews in the app store makes it game over.  Its winner take all.  RKT will clean up in the down turn.  they will earn less with less business and higher rates but the long term earnings power of this company is $2-3/share and growing every downturn.

*Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again. I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog.***

Anyone questions? Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)

Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking

*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.

**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:

1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.
2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.

**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.

In a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.

**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**

Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Notice how the assets in XRT plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze? ](https://preview.redd.it/42ad6za10bn61.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=364f31a7d14fa24bd904457707b93dbd5b47e6b6)

Notice how the assets in XRT plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?

*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*

***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***

Just taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**

Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.

**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.

**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.

**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.

The Link Between Failure to Delivers (FTD) and ETF's

ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.

**Failure To Deliver (FTD)-** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.

&amp;#x200B;

[The daily volume of FTD traded in the past](https://preview.redd.it/y4ha52lh0bn61.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd65d206e939e87321aa5eaccb5f19ab8a1d880f)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[ETF's being shorted in the past](https://preview.redd.it/v82mqv4j0bn61.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f028d2a0101f9e128b3c2735b733d08a5afb899)

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in FTD has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their FTD's way before $GME. **Bunch of snakes**

**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**

When faced with ""excessive buying"" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as ""Naked"" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in an FTD **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are ""making markets"" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.

**TLDR**

**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the SSR need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**
