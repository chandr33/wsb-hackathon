# Purpose

# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? [Essay: Understanding Square, Jay-Z, and the Future of Fintech Neobanking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m50k8j/understanding_fintech_square_jayz_and_the_future/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
* Are we familiar with new international trade guidelines that influence tech and labor markets? **(DD in Draft Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Fastly DD in Progress)**
* Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

## Investing in Internet Forums

Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt;Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service](https://preview.redd.it/yzbliuqcchn61.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8229f3f0b6e391586ee4e1c3221421806d11f625)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cbn2mq7jchn61...*

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

* Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
* Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
* Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
* Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
* Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming. I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.

## Searching

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a friend-site. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced **interests**, which we will touch on shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pinterest users have an incredibly high “willingness to engage” as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.](https://preview.redd.it/syjh910gchn61.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfe41d3d3e1f090b54a7808ad219525e17a2756)

&amp;#x200B;

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

\- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)

\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)

\- Skincare ideas (Target)

\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)

\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)

\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

&amp;#x200B;

[Corsair Setup Ideas: note links to Wayfair and Reddit.](https://preview.redd.it/28p51x7nchn61.png?width=3781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf61f14e7ef5e68af301003a471aa4ea4ad87304)

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. **That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ckqdi9uchn61.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b649cf3fcdf7d8e1c96acb6085030b2d3c4993b0

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

# The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

&amp;#x200B;

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wu0snw0ychn61.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db70470f59d9ef1df7ae29469c500d235559aec

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

79,m6ncf0,"**EDIT 2 - THE THEORY**

After thinking about edit 1, and my general unease with how easily ETFs seem to be manipulated/used to manipulate shares, I thought, what if the ETFs are **Gargantua**?

/u/TomatoeHaven sent me this the other day: [https://www.ft.com/content/44718dbb-abba-48aa-9499-f6bc15f412c0](https://www.ft.com/content/44718dbb-abba-48aa-9499-f6bc15f412c0)

What if the natural shock absorbing ability of the ETFs, using a spread of shares to ensure consistent growth to achieve a headline price that can only ever grow, is fatally unprepared for a short squeeze?

Should a margin call occur, the ETFs containing both GME and any margin called shares should maintain stability, as they will relatively offset each other. **(The maths on various ETFs and their ratios may need to be checked to call me out on any bullshit here).**

However, should this occur, the ETFs will create false safe havens in a crashing market, algos and inexperienced traders will move money into these ETFs, ultimately exposing new, external money to the GME short squeeze.

**EDIT 1 - The advice contained in the post below could cause an automatic siphoning of the majority of the money in the world into the hands of apes. It should be used with the utmost caution.**

Before reading my post below, please consider the following prior to acting upon the idea below. Should $CUM be successful, the companies contained within our $CUM will be artificially supported in the case of a total market crash.

Should this occur, we would expect traders and algorithms worldwide to flock to what are seemingly the only safe stocks left in existence, by this time they will be priced out of buying into GME.

As more money flows into these individual stocks, and the $CUM ETF itself, those who have not yet been exposed by the short squeeze will find their money being used to pay the bill. **GARGANTUA WILL BE FORMED.**

This is a warning that you may become the person responsible for vacuuming up all of the world's money should you be the ape that brings $CUM to the world.

**You have been warned. ⛔🦍**

=======

I had the fun idea that the $GME price was related directly to the number of mentions of $CUM &amp; $ASS. My hypothesis is that as $GME rises, apes will naturally scream louder about $CUM &amp; $ASS. 🦍🦍🦍

&amp;#x200B;

**How can this perpetual ape energy be harnessed? How can this energy be used to feed the short squeeze?**

I propose the first ever reddit-driven ETF, $CUM 🚀💦

Following some quick research, with the DD provided by /u/Oliark

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040115/how-create-your-very-own-etf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040115/how-create-your-very-own-etf.asp)

An enterprising ape could create $CUM, if they were an ape with plenty of bananas to their name, maybe they could afford a marketing budget to spread $CUM all over the world. 🚀💦🌎🌍🌏

*But how does this help the squeeze?*

If hedge funds get margin called as the short squeeze takes place, their holdings in other stocks will be sold off to pay the bill. Obviously, this will reduce the prices of these shares, reducing the overall amount in the pot for $GME holders to 💎🙌 when holding out for the highest possible sell price.

If the creator of $CUM could ascertain the most likely shares to be sold during the margin call, they could create an ETF purely containing these stocks.

*What makes $CUM so potent?*

As I postulate, as the short squeeze occurs and the apes do what apes do 🦍🚀💦💦💦💦💦💦💦, the trading algorithms tracking various subreddits will be absolutely flooded with our $CUM! Trading exchanges will grind to a halt as the floors become stickier and sticker, with more and more AI brains around the world begging to buy in to our $CUMswap.

In theory, this should negate a portion of the impact upon the share prices of those companies held together by our $CUM.

*Why isn't $CUM a hot sticky mess of market manipulation?*

Thank you Louis for the opportunity to answer this question, when I was a young boy in Bulgaria I never dreamed of becoming a lawyer, so I'm drastically unequipped to answer this question.

All I can say is the following:

Did we ask to be tracked? *No*

Are we responsible for the tracking? *No*

Are we responsible for how external parties use the data that they scrape from us? *No*

98,m6njm8,"Not a financial or legal advisor.  Honest question.  

I'm a pretty sophisticated ape.  Unless I am missing something, the only way for 106.46% of float to be held by Institutions and 21.88% of the float to be held by Insiders (data courtesy of Trade-Ideas) is if some of the shares held long are synthetic shares.  How is that even possible (rhetorical question)?  My understanding is synthetic shares are used to ensure liquidity in the options market; but the I.O.U's are supposed to be settled with actual shares if an option is exercised.  Rather than spend hours studying the regs, I will just assume either (1) the rules do not impose a sufficient amount of audit/reconciliation requirements; or (2) rules are being broken.  

Either way, it seems the MMs and HFs have been able to ""create"" synthetic shares, which are then sold and purchased ""long"" in the market.  Apart from confirming how rigged and fucked up the system is; can't they just keep this game up forever?  In other words, can't they just purchase a bunch of in-the-money call options and exercise them to ""buy back"" the shares and return them to the lender? There is a theory that is what the hedgies tried to do last week in their short ladder attack (and that it was actually the Hedgies that had purchased the $300 and $325 call options; and, that it was the long whales who prevented the price from being $300 last Friday so he hedgies could not exercise their options as they are running out of shares held long).

BTW: I am bullish on GME and have a large position.  So certainly not to rain on anyone's parade.",Can the MMs and HFs keep artificially increasing GME float (synthetic shares) to keep kicking the short-squeeze down the road?,1.0,1615940604,txtrdr456
99,m6nk57,"I've been playing around VERY casually for 3-4 years now, just buying stocks I like, but never enough money to go FR (for the record I sold 13 shares of GME Oct '20 that I had less than $4 apiece in out of disgust at the stock). But today I was cleaning out my old mail, and the one about GME having a Dutch auction caught my eye. Lost it, so I searched 'Robinhood Dutch' and a second email popped up that AMC had one, too. I googled and sounded like a Dutch auction was supposed to RAISE the price of a stock to close its actual worth, but it seems like it did the opposite. Is this because of the short sellers? I admit the movie 'The Big Short' made my head hurt, and I've always taken a much more touchy-feely approach to stock buying. 

Did these dutch auctions indeed have a negative impact on the stock? Was it because someone was cheating? Is this just a coincidence that these two stocks (I am decently diversified) had this? I just don't believe in coincidence. Screenshots of emails with dates of auction listed.
