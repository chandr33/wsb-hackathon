2,lwcz02,"I understand this is a smaller cap name, but it shouldn't be. 

$OPTN reports earnings premarket tomorrow and the prescription grown has increased \~60% YoY which should lead to nice sized rev growth, but with the downside pressure from the shorts it's share price has been struggling. Listen I'm not pumping an OTC name without doing research. I have a relative that should have tried Xhance, OPTN's flagship drug, instead of getting a very invasive sinus procedure. The surgery took about 4 weeks to recover from and hasn't provided much relief. As opposed to reading the reviews on Xhance... this product changes people's lives who live with sinus polyps and is a cost efficient alternative to surgery.

The company has a patent on the delivery device that is used to distribute the steroid to the upper nasal cavity. Wall street analysts love the name and have an average of a $15 price target on it. The market cap should be over 3x what it is right now. 

If all goes according to plan I don't see why this can't grow exponentially and eventually get acquired by a bigger pharma company. Sure the steroid has been used before, but it's proven to be more effective when applied with the EDS (exhalation delivery system) that Xhance has.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: this name is being shorted into oblivion, but people actually benefit from this company's patented drug. Very good short squeeze candidate as the float % is small, but highly shorted. I think we see a run to a $5 open tomorrow.","Smaller Cap, Big Upside $OPTN earnings tomorrow morning",1.0,1614720417,tonysoprano6969

11,lwczjd,"Here is an imgur link with pictures to what I'm referencing and Robinhood's email response to why they sold one of my GME stocks.

https://imgur.com/gallery/GTqi4Yc

When you sign up for Robinhood, they let you try gold for free for like a month. I took advantage of that so I can see the Level II. I planned on cancelling it about 2 weeks before the trial expired, but when I tried, it said you'd lose access to gold immediately. So I thought, eh I'll wait closer to the renewal date, then cancel. Well, I forgot. Like everyone else, I have a million things going on everyday and it just slipped my mind. I saw that it renewed and  thought to myself, eh, whatever, it's only $5 and I like having access to the L2 anyway. I figured they just charged the account I had on file. Apparently not, I guess they charged my purchasing power and then MARGIN CALLED ME ON IT. For the record, I check my account every day and did not once see -$5 in my purchasing power, it was always at $0. Margin is not enabled on this account, so why would they renew gold on margin, instead of just cancelling it like EVERY OTHER COMPANY. If you have a card on file, and it gets declined, the company just cancels whatever service you have instead of auto renewing it. RH apparently charges you for the service up front on margin which you tell them you don't want to use.

If you look at the pictures, you can see gold renewed on Feb 25, the email from RH says I was margin called on Feb 25. They sold GME at 127 and some change, and my purchasing power is now 122 and some change, the $5 difference for gold. This is just such scummy and shady practice. Not to mention, IF I CANCEL THE GOLD I JUST PAID FOR SO IT WON'T AUTO RENEW, I LOSE ACCESS TO GOLD IMMEDIATELY. Even though I just paid them for a service for a MONTH UP FRONT, I'll lose access to it if I cancel and don't want to auto renew. Absolutely insane.

When it comes to brokerages, RH is the shady used car dealer. If my GME wasn't held up on RH from January, I would have already withdrawn and moved back to etrade.",DAILY REMINDER TO DELETE ROBINHOOD.

78,lwd6hb,"Concise DD for y'all today.

I've been keeping an eye on the beverages sector for the last couple months, looking for good buying opportunities, either undervalued or with long-term growth potential. Splash Beverage ($SBEV) is, in my not-a-financial-advisor opinion, extremely well positioned to profit from COVID reopening, principally due to their recent acquisition of Copa di Vino. 

**Pros:**

* Extremely strong CEO with extensive experience in the beverages sector. The CEO, Robert Nistico, was VP of Red Bull North America from extremely early on in Red Bull's history, growing Red Bull from $0 to $1.45 billion in sales over his tenure. 
* Closed on acquisition of Copa di Vino - single-serving glasses of wine for BBQ/tailgate - including ""additional distribution within the Anheuser-Busch Network and ***13,000 retail locations*** across various chains, in addition to e-commerce outlets."" The single-serve segment of the wine industry is growing faster that bottled wine, and allows for competition with malt bevs/beer, which is a relatively untapped market ([Source 1](https://www.oilandgas360.com/splash-beverage-group-inc-finalizes-acquisition-of-copa-di-vino-leading-producer-of-premium-wine-by-the-glass-in-over-13000-retail-locations/), [Source 2](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/splash-beverage-group-inc-executes-120000775.html)).
* Closed new funding round (equity and warrants) last week (2/26) of $1.2 million. 
* Just began revenue generation in the past year, totaling $1.7 million (trailing twelve months). 44% gross margin (my calcs from Q3 2020 10-Q). Revenue generation ***does not include*** the Copa di Vino acquisition as far as I can tell, as that wasn't completed until 12/28/2020. 
* Appear to have fixed their previous S-T debt/accrued expenses overhang. Current liabilities declined from $10.3 million EoY 2019 to $4 million in Sept 2020.  This sounds like a prudent use of resources to me, given the COVID economy over the past year.  Again, these balance-sheet improvements were ***before*** the acquisition of a substantial new revenue stream. 

**Neutral:**

* They also make SALT tequila - a line of flavored blanco tequilas, which have decent reviews from what I've seen online, but unclear what the distribution coverage is. 

**Cons:**

* Recent funding round brought their current/quick ratios over 1.0, but they will likely need to do another funding round toward the end of this year or beginning 2022, depending on how revenue generation kicks off. 
* One of their previous acquisitions, Tapout Performance Drink, looks to have been a dud. I don't follow MMA closely, but I've seen a fair amount of out of stock/mixed reviews online. However, it also looks like they are pivoting to focus on the alcoholic side of their portfolio given the recent acquisition. 

**Price Target:** Tricky to evaluate given how recent the revenue generation is and the new product line. I'm targeting in the $3.50-4.00 range in the short term, but I think it has substantial upside and/or buyout potential in the longer-term given the distribution agreements. (So, if it spikes hard, I'll likely sell and look to rebuy later.)

**TL;DR: This is an executive leadership and COVID-reopening play in the single-serve alcoholic beverages space. Has some short-term fundraising questions, but fundamentals look generally sound and it's well-positioned for the next few quarters.** 

Position: 500 shares @ $1.92.
