(upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!)
We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. 

**Fact 1:** Last Friday the GME &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.


**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that ❤️. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!

**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter’s market manipulation.

SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let’s start with the premarket update

**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. 

Stocks available to short: 650.000
Current Stock Price: 13.46$

**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.

Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)
Current Price: 13.35$

Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!

**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that’s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn’t far away until than.

**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,
I’m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn’t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain’t too late! 

Current Price: 13$
Shares available to borrow: 750.000

**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes 🚀). 
Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their “borrowable-shares” it’s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the 🚀 starts off to the 🌚 

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current stock price: 12.94$

**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won’t succeed.

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;— is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!

**Update 12:03**
1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that’s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. 
Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that 
Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.

Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.
Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)

**Update 12:08**
The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.

**Update 12:20**
HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they’re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i’m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.50$

**Update 12:21**
What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.

Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%
Current Price: 12.75

**Update 13:01**
AMC is slowly refuelling it’s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.
Besides that not much has happened.

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.8$

**Update 13:05**
It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!
We also have an inversed head &amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. 

Warning: I hope my boss doesn’t ask me why i am taking regular shits every 1 hour ... 🚀

**And I’m making an giveaway for BUY THE FKN DIP!** ... APES since we are currently in a dip i will gift [this Hoodie](https://apemerch.com/?product=to-the-moon-hoodie) to one comment  if AMC reaches 16$ EOD! Cause i fkin love the stonk and made allready double my initial investment back! 🚀🥵

Just write your size in the comments ... and color or you’ll get an blue XS 🥲🥲

22,m6e8zo,"We all knwo the play for this week is mainly $GME ( europoor here -  brothers apes save me , i 'm bag holding hard  300+ :\_; ) ***but $UWMC is a really nice play atm.***

There are many factors that can give fuel to this undervalued moon rocket  🚀  🚀  🚀 :

1) **Potential squeeze** (short term): this stocks has been shorted hard in the past month and now sits at 8,40$ (IPO prive was about 10$ , so is basically for sale now ) , but there are many calls for 19/03/2021 at 9$/10$  that we can make expire ITM for an explosive effect ! (shitload of open insterest  also for april calls)  

2) **RUSSEL Index inclusion** (short term and long term): UWMC is slated to join the RUSSEL 1k&amp;3k indexes on March 21 = boom baby ! all the funds /etf / institutial players who replicate the index in some form HAVE to buy the stock.

3) **UWMC pasys dividends**  (long term)

4)  **Analysts are bullish on this stocks**, giving an average target price of **11,63$ / 12,40$**  (in case if u care )

5) **The company had a superb 2020 (in terms of revenue / earnigs )** and is projected to have also a superb Q1 (house market &amp; mortage are in ""bullish"" mode )

6) **the CEO is steel balls guy** ,read some article on the ""ultimatum"" he made to kill $RKT (SPOILER: i**t worked -** [**https://i.redd.it/54j1n92kmen61.png**](https://i.redd.it/54j1n92kmen61.png))

**In the end,  if you have some spare money / gains to throw somewhere , $UWMC is a great oppurtunity for this week.**

23,m6e91q,"No advice will be found here just one apes thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imma tell this as I understand it, please do correct me if I'm wrong. Also explaining this also helps me to understand it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine one GME share is equal to one  🍌, we can understand that. Now, the 🐻🌈 see those Gamestop shares as mouldy  🍌, so they think that they will be worthless and decided to say to Gamestop, ""We'll buy those 🍌 now"" back in 2020 when this all started, with an agreement that they would sell those exact 🍌back to Gamestop in the future for a lower value. (That's how a short works). 

Now the man, myth and not cat u/DFV comes in and sees that actually its just a mouldy skin on the  🍌and the inside is pure gold. He decides he wants to buy lots of the mouldy  🍌because he sees their deep fucking value. He posts some of his findings on the  🍌 forums and people are excited and want to buy gold  🍌. 

Now it's January and lots of apes are buying many  🍌 that hopefully will be gold inside, but they're not sure. The deadline for the 🐻🌈 to return those mouldy  🍌 for less, is fast approaching, but they already sold their mouldy  🍌 to make their gains when they first bought them. But with all the potential of these being gold  🍌 , there are no  🍌 left in the gamestop shop. 🐻🌈 are now scared.

Apes started to peel open their  🍌 around Jan w/c 25th. Apes would've made big tendies if apes opened  🍌 then.  🐻🌈 would have been able to buy them all back but at a significant loss which 🐻🌈 get angry about because 🐻🌈 are very fragile inside. 

Angry 🐻🌈 decide to shut all the shops where apes can buy  🍌. This stops the apes from opening their  🍌and the belief that they are *actually* gold inside fades away. Meanwhile, 🐻🌈 go to another shop and start buying normal  🍌 which are not definitely not gold inside but look like the mouldy  🍌all the apes want. (This is why the float % is above 100%, because there are fake gold  🍌 in the market.)

Now this gives some time for the 🐻🌈 to be able to buy back the original  🍌 as the belief and price of all the 🍌falls. Some of the chimps sell their potential gold  🍌because they are scared that they might not actually be real gold inside, lowering the price even more. 

Meanwhile, king ape u/DFV is being threatened with ape jail because he made 🐻🌈 angry. King ape has big balls and still believes they are gold inside and doubles the amount of  🍌 he has. Apes go mad and start to buy more  🍌 whether they are gold or not.  🍌are good for apes, even if they are not gold inside. 

Whilst 🐻🌈 are trying to find the real gold 🍌that they promised to give back in their first trade they keep promising more and more and more to buy themselves some time. Well the people who regulate the shops we buy 🍌from are started to get pissed of by 🐻🌈 being angry and breaking stuff. So they propose to change the rules so that the 🐻🌈 MUST give back the original 🍌within a much shorter period (previously 21 days, potentially 2 days if upcoming changes pass). 

🐻🌈 have many tricks in their fur, they can roar at ape like ' 🍌ARE BAD', 'DONT BUY  🍌', 'WE ALREADY CLOSED (covered) OUR ORIGINAL TRADE'. Well, ape is dumb but no autist, why would 🐻🌈still be angry and shouting if they had fixed their problem? Ape smells bearshit.

A culmination of king big balls u/DFV, 🐻🌈 getting more angry, many fake ape bots saying  🍌are not good, the regulators of  🍌shop changing the rules, ape president giving money to 80% of apes so they could buy more  🍌, papa Cohen hired into 🍌 growing company,  all point towards this not being over and there are still gold  🍌 in the market that the 🐻🌈 really really need.

Apes start to hear rumour that papa Cohen might lead the  🍌 growing company, and that  🍌growing company is about to release its earnings over the Christmas holidays (Remember how all those next gen consoles got sold out), and that  🍌growing company might recall all of those original bananas to hold an ape meeting. If original  🍌 are recalled then 🐻🌈 MUST find them, and will involve them buying many 🍌 to get them to their ape owners.

🐻🌈 Are getting very angry and running out of tactics to make apes let go of  🍌. But guess what? Ape loves  🍌 more than ever. Ape enjoys 🐻🌈being angry, because 🐻🌈 fucked many ape families years ago. 

Some smooth brained apes think they could sell their  🍌for a good price now to buy MORE 🍌later. Well what if ape sold some of those gold 🍌? and instead bought mouldy ones later?

&amp;#x200B;

If any of these situations arose where 🐻🌈 need to find the original 🍌, then 🐻🌈 is fuk because there are potentially up to 900% more 🍌than when this all started, and ape can demand what ape wants to sell their 🍌 for. Many apes want $1,000,000 for their 🍌, but the longer 🐻🌈take, then ape can ask for more.

What if 🐻🌈 hasn't got that much money to buy all 🍌for a milli each? 

Well then the shop regulators will sell all of the 🐻🌈 apples and oranges and pears to make sure they have enough for the 🍌.

&amp;#x200B;

What if they still don't have enough money?

Then those regulators have a money printing machine and ape government has reserves for this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Ape loves 🍌. 🍌may be gold inside, so ape never letting go of 🍌he already has, only buying more. 🐻🌈 are angry are apes for winning.

&amp;#x200B;

Please correct me if I made some mistakes or could add to my analogy. There are MANY smart apes in this treehouse, and I have learnt a lot from them in only a couple months. Be grateful.

32,m6ea8b,"**TL;DR:**  Vix is below 20, but the uncertainty in post-stimulus re-opening, interest rates, tax rates, etc implies a lot of volatility ahead.  Put something aside now to re-capitalize yourself later.

Look, most of you guys can't even stand the concept of ""diversification"", much less the thought of ""insurance"".  After all, you're young, you're immortal, you're healthy, and stonks only go up.  You're living the life of a thanksgiving turkey.  Every day is better than the last while you're getting fat, dumb, and happy.  Until things change, rapidly.

Think all the way back to the first week of March...just two weeks ago.  Some of you holding all short term calls had a near portfolio death experience.  You swore not to let this happen to you again, but then the market turned on a dime, you might have even made money instead of losing everything, and you convinced yourself of your inner genius.  Now we're already back to ""stonks only go up"".

Today is the one year anniversary of the largest DOW point drop in history, 3rd largest S&amp;P percentage loss. But things look mostly good now. We know the re-open of the economy is going to be insane.  The old stimulus dollars are still mostly on the sidelines, with trillions more about to hit bank accounts.  Soon planes will be full, restaurants will be packed, and everyone will do their part to make it rain.  Vix is under 20!

That doesn't mean that all is great ahead.  Interest rates will rise.  The administration used this week to start laying the groundwork at tax increases - increases that will target capital gains and holders of wealth.  

I'm not bearish (yet), but I expect volatility to increase, at times suddenly and with little warning.  If you have a mostly WSB ""investment"" strategy long short term calls, a quick 10% drop that doesn't immediately rebound could wipe you out.

Unless...you buy yourself an escape pod.  This morning I put some money into September VXX calls.  Note that the ITM calls aren't much more expensive than OTM calls.  Thus, I'll capture most of the dollar for dollar VXX spike when Vix goes nuts during our next panic moment.

I have no idea when this may happen, but I've given myself six months.  I've preset the sale price at 3x what I paid.  Should my WSB call portfolio go to shit (and everything suddenly be on sale), I'll have an escape pod ready to re-capitalize my account (and buy low) if the worst happens.  Even if it doesn't, I've found having a small insurance position to provide a small psychological benefit on a day when everything else is red.  I plan on rolling this in 90 days if we haven't had a panic that hits my strike price.

I have no stock (heh) in GME and I'm not planning on buying in. But I've been keeping an eye on the numbers and every single time I see the ups and downs and spikes and attacks I think to myself, ""there's no way people don't buckle here.""

83,m6ehn4,"I've attached an image of WTI - Crude Oil and the Purple line is the correlation between WTI and the company HAL - Halliburton. 

About Halliburton - 

They are the largest ""services"" company for the Oil and Gas industry.  They have their greedy little fingers in every aspect of Oil and Gas all over the world.  If the price of Oil is bullish then they are making bank.  

What really caught my attention was the last 10 years when comparing the price of oil during inflationary periods and how it impacted HAL share price.  You'll notice that only after the financial crisis and during Covid, two times in which the world pretty much shut down, did HAL ever trade below (% wise) with WTI.   Obviously on this chart horizon of 10 years.  If you back out to 1996 then HAL is trading % wise over 100% lower than WTI.   

&amp;#x200B;

With inflation pressures this will only cause WTI to continue to increase as well as if you are bullish that people will actually start traveling more.  Which is what traveling companies like Expedia are forecasting.  People have been locked up in their homes and their ready to get out and burn oil... 

Political Pressures - 

With the Biden admin hurting US based oil companies by banning fracking and production on federal land this also has caused pressure on the price of oil.  Not as many drill sites can start up as before.  Also the Keystone pipeline XL project was shut down.  Not to mention if Biden decides to start another middle east conflict.  The treasury wants the interest rate on the 10 year to be around 2.5% which would also increase oil's price.  

&amp;#x200B;

My dumb ape brain is saying that HAL is a major play for the Covid open trade.  However, I'm a stupid moron who is just guessing and this probably will fail...

88,m6eixc,"So Ryan Cohen originally purchased his 12.9% stake in Gamestop at $8.43 per share average.  Based on the current price, this is about a 2300% profit.  

Per his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.

So let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.  Thoughts?
