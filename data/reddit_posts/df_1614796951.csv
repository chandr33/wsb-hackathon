DD done a month ago:

Positions:

3/19 $80c
3/19 $90c

I've been waiting to buy the dip and this thing will not drop with the market. So I'm just gonna ride this seemingly unstoppable wave. There's a decent chance it can hit 80 before March 19 at this rate.

I'm holding many more long term contracts and shares. I really believe in the stock so the short term recommendations are for those that want a quick flip. Personally I'd go longer, likely will surpass $100 EOY.",VIAC - defying market trend 🚀🚀,0.63,1614797235,Tookie_Knows
