We have been provided with GOD level DD’s on this subreddit, and it has even been said CNBC that some of the DD that is provided here is greater and more in depth than most hedge funds provide. We are ABOVE hedge fund level.

There has been an extremely detailed DD (wish I could find it, but would appreciate an ape to link it in the comments if they know where to refer) stating that the CURRENT actual value is in the mid $7000, all of the working for this beautiful figure was provided and shows VERY strong backing.

ON TOP of that, we know for a FACT that GME has been shorted OVER 100%. GME stated it themselves, and reported to the SEC of the “potential” squeeze to follow. DD’s fluctuate the actual figure from low 200% up to 900%, NINE-HUNDRED FUCKING PERCENT. The potential is fucking unfathomable.

But bear in mind, combining this knowledge shows the MINIMUM potential. This proves that those who pull out before 10k haven’t shoved enough diamonds in their bananas for breakfast. THIS IS THE MINIMUM. The POTENTIAL as many of us have seen is the fucking millions, this can only be obtained if no one sells their shares as this would mean the hedge fuckers won’t be able to cover and then would cause the INFINITY squeeze we only dream of.

This means that somewhere between this MINIMUM, and INFINITY, the peak will be... and it’s up to US to decide. Now how many Lambo’s do you want to buy your wife’s boyfriend?

So this is a company on the education sector, name is Boxlight.


I first bought in last July 2020, clearly by fomo, and got in at something like $3.50 (so this only proves the kind of retard I am). They had released by that time some PR talking about a partnership with Samsung, because they sell interactive boards and stuff.

I then averaged down (oh look at me, I almost look like I know what I am doing) and ended up with an average around $2.73.

I sold all of them for the first time at around $3.10 this February.

Since I noticed a pattern on the daily chart (wow, now this text was clearly copied from other smart ass apes) I started day tradding this stock and was successfull doing so.

Last 2 weeks haven't been that good and I started to accomulate for the ER

On they day after the ER, so last Friday, when PM started it peaked $3.52 and I was awake and saw that and thought to myself ""oh just look at this, today it will be massive!!! I will not sell now, although I would profit very nicely if I would sell"".

And it didn't... the peak during Friday tradding session was around $3.08 if I'm not mistaken.

But with such great ER, great aquisitions they made so far, great CEO, great partnerships, I honestly do think this will blow very, very soon so today when the stock price reached $2.50 I just bought more!!! :D


Now remember this, I am a f***ing retarded ape with DIAMOND HANDS who is HODLing GME, AMC, SPCE, CCIV and others...

I am not a financial advisor, I just love stonks!

For those looking into this companies situation, you know this is a good situation for investors &amp; Ecoark. I just can't seem to figure out why this isn't being talked about as much.

DD:  
-Walmart &amp; Ecoark had a contract which allowed Walmart to use the ZEST technology and work with Ecoark in order to help Walmart's supply chain in the produce world. It allowed Walmart to save billions on wasted food that went bad too quickly. A couple of years ago, Walmart terminated the contract and made their own program (with the help of IBM) called Eden, which did the exact same thing.  
-Walmart got caught with their hand in the cookie jar and Ecoark is suing them. 
- Every instance of Walmart in court is to either wait their opponents out until they cannot pay for the long court cases, or buy out the company/ its product so they can continue to make money on it.
-You can check the court documents on Pacer with Judge Moody presiding over the case.  
- Yahoo there are a bunch of bashers, but there is one person whom has done a workup of those owning shares and how much they would be worth, he goes by ""Zest vs Walmart Jury trial 3/29"" and has been very thorough throughout the entire process and ignores a lot of the bashers which are paid to downplay certain stocks.
-It was recently a penny stock but the company did a reverse split to bring it onto the nasdaq. 
-court case started today and a jury was chosen upon, ecoark wants to see this through to the end, and with messages coming from the head of the company at the time, there isn’t much that Walmart can do to say they didn’t steal a product under contract.
