3,m3jywm,"Hi, I just wanna hear your guy’s thoughts on Olin Corp.
Olin is a Missouri company that manufactures small arms ammunition for Winchester and produces poly resins, chlor alkali, and vinyls in plants all over the world.3
My interest is that they are an ammunition manufacturer. I’m a hunter and I like having ammo on hand for my rifles &amp; shotguns but recently it’s been very difficult to find any sort of ammunition at the stores. All I know is that their is a huge demand for ammo right now in the US and you can’t find it in the stores. With a Biden administration I feel like they will only talk about pushing gun laws but will never doing anything fruitful. This will only keep republicans buying up all the ammo they can get their hands on for at least 4 years. 
I’ve heard before that the hunting/shooting industry is an industry that is not affect by a recession. I’ve also seen gun manufactures here in the US looking more suppliers for walnut blocks for making gun stocks. 
I’m gonna continue doing research on this stock but I wanna here your guy’s thoughts on it and if you have any more information.",Thoughts on Olin Corp. (OLN)? 🧨💣💸💰,1.0,1615563148,DebateSudden

So with that being said I have a decent understanding on the difference between calls and puts. I guess where i get confused is that i see you can theoretically have unlimited gains in an OTM call option, but can you have unlimited losses as well if i don't hit or the price drops? 

I guess another way to ask the question is if i spend $300 on call options, is that $300 my total risk or is there a scenario where i can lose MORE than the $300?

There is a lot to like about eBay. 

* Cashflow generative
* The rotation into cyclical and the valuation due to growth not being a scarcity anymore
* Valuation: it has been lagging even S&amp;P in return despite a 17% yoy increase in GMV in 2020

But most importantly, I think its business model makes a lot of sense. It cherry-picked the most value add to the sellers on the platform. It doesn't get involved in shipping unless it is global, then it uses its own freight forwarding to backout fx, shipping, and custom. This is a big differentiator in the platform and solves the main pain point. But it does not get into the 2-day free shipping etc, as it is logistically convoluted and costly. It also does not alienate sellers or try to compete for their business. 

What it lacks is an experience for buyers that is as convincing as the seller's side. 

And I believe that is coming. In the past year, it has improved the buyer's experience with authentication rollout and more curation. It touts more millennials and gen z on the platform, especially in the circular 2nd hand goods. 

Here are the specifics; 

1, competitive advantage: global

The big increase during the pandemic because of the access to global supply chains. These customers once on-boarded are actually sticky with similar attributes to the previous cohorts.

The global reach is enabled by the global dropshipping and freight forwarding program of eBay, which is a pain point of amazon, tmall, etc. 

Given eBay is also ⅓ split among, us, Europe, and the rest of the world, this will be a meaningful point.

2, capturing the zeitgeist is an opportunity

eBay is now methodically rolling out new verticals that capture the zeitgeist. Their current pushes are sneakers and luxury watches. These are high-growth categories. The specifics might fade, but they are constantly searching for new verticals to add. 

There will be new tulips and eBay has been quite able to capture them. This represents a small percentage of GMV but it brings new buyers and sellers onto the platform maintaining market share as well as mind share

This effort is credible as if there is something you don’t think you can find anywhere, you will try eBay. (eg, oil tanker)
