2,m0x7fx,"Like always, I believe in strength in numbers. And believe it or not were a team here. So the smarter we get the stronger well become. Lets make history together and brain up

P8 Support and Resistance 

-Support and resistance are like a floor and a ceiling, with prices sandwiched between them

-Rating their strength helps decide whether the trend is likely to continue or to reverse.

-Support is a price level where buying is strong enough to interrupt or reverse a downtrend.

-Resistance: a price where selling is strong enough to interrupt or reverse an uptrend.

-It is better to draw support/resistance lines across the edges of congestion areas instead of extreme prices

-The edges show where masses of traders have changed their minds, while the extremes  reflect only panic among the weakest traders.

-Minor support or resistance causes trends to pause, while major support or resistance causes them to reverse. 

-Effective Traders buy at support and sell at resistance 

- If traders remember that an uptrend ⬇️ after rising to a certain peak, they sell and go short when prices approach that level again

-If traders remember that prices stopped falling and ⬆️ from a certain level, they are likely to buy when prices approach that level

-Feelings of pain and regret are mild in trading ranges where swings are small and losers do not get hurt too badly

-When the market stays flat for a while, traders get used to buying at the lower edge of the range and shorting at the upper edge.

-Resistance is the most dangerous spot to buy because both bulls and bears are ready to sell.

-Support is a spot where bulls are ready to buy and bears are 50/50 on what to do next

-In uptrends, bears who sold short feel pain and bulls feel regret that they did not buy more. Both feel determined to buy if the market gives them a second chance. The pain and regret make them ready to buy, creating support during reactions in an uptrend 

-When prices break down from a trading range, bulls who bought feel pain and wait for a rally to let them get out even. Bears regret that they didnt short more and wait for a rally to give them a second chance to sell short. The pain &amp; regret create resistance a ceiling above the market in a downtrend

-The longer prices stay in a congestion zone, the stronger the commitment of bulls&amp;bears to that area. When prices approach that zone from above, it serves as support. When prices rally into it from below, it acts as resistance 

-The strength of every support or resistance zone depends on three factors: its length(time its been there), its height, and the volume of trading that has taken place in it

-The more time its been there, the stronger it is

-A 2week trading range provides only minimal s&amp;r, a 2month range gives people time to become used to it and creates intermediate support or resistance, while a 2year range becomes accepted as a standard of value and offers major s&amp;r

-As support and resistance levels grow old, they gradually become weaker. The price is bound to change

-The taller the support and resistance zone, the stronger it is

-A congestion zone whose height equals 1 percent of current market value provides only minor s&amp;r

-A congestion zone that is 3 percent tall provides intermediate s&amp;r

-A congestion zone that is 7 percent tall or higher can grind down a major trend.

-The greater the volume of trading in a support and resistance zone, the stronger it is

-High volume in a congestion area shows active involvement by traders thus strong s&amp;r. Low volume shows little interest in transacting at that level - a sign of weak s&amp;r

-Whenever the trend you are riding approaches support or resistance, tighten your protective stop

-A trend reveals its health by how it acts when it hits s&amp;r. If it is strong enough to penetrate that zone, it accelerates.

-If a trend bounces away from support or resistance, it reveals its weakness 

-S&amp;r are more important on long-term charts than on short-term charts.

-If the weekly trend is sailing through a clear zone, the fact that the daily trend is hitting resistance is less important. 

-When a weekly trend approaches s&amp;r, time to shit your pants

-Support and resistance levels are useful for placing stop-loss and protect-profit orders

-Cautious traders buy after a breakout and place a stop in the middle of a congestion area. A true breakout should not be followed by a pullback into the range, just as a rocket is not supposed to sink back.

-Most breakouts from trading ranges are false. They suck in trendfollowers just before prices return. A false breakout is the bane of amateurs, but professional traders love them

We have compared the GME squeeze to it over and over again but no one has put this in lamest terms yet. If GME where to briefly pass apple in market cap (who is at 1.98 trillion at the time of writing) that would mean over 150x from the 12 billion that GME is sitting at now.  Using very rough math to make numbers easy that would take us to 30k-ish per share. Just let that all sink in for a bit.  The last time a short squeeze of this magnitude was pulled off the company briefly became the largest company in the world by way of market cap; it has a very real potential of happening again.   
      This is in no way financial advice. If you can’t tell by the poor grammar and math I’m just a 🦍 who is probably dumber then the rest of you. I like the GME stock and 🍌 🍌 🍌 and video games. I have personal interest in the stock going up.

16,m0xc8q,"Academy Sports and Outdoors (Ticker : ASO) isn’t just the next Rocket or Gamestop. You shouldn’t view them as simply a squeeze opportunity. If you’re looking for just a squeeze and quick 100% gains without ever thinking about the stock again, this isn’t the post for you, it holds lots of info but I’m not spamming rocket emojis and this isn’t a pump and dump. 

Academy Sports and Outdoors is a retailer of sporting goods based out of Katy, Texas which is just to the west of Houston. They’ve been mostly concentrated in the Houston area, but recently have been expanding into areas throughout the Southern US. During their expansion their careful selection of store locations “has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. “ (From Wikipedia). They’ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 

As a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of REI (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. 

I’m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I’ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren’t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They’re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings
just recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn’t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn’t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.

In the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can’t see what’s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. 

Not that I’m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy’s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. 

These factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today’s bullish nod from Barron’s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I’m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I’m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains.

1. They are expanding into [Germany](https://investors.dynavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dynavax-announces-european-commission-marketing-authorization) in Q4 for their hep-b adjuvant which is their flagship product. This only requires 2 doses as opposed to 3, and over a shorter timeframe. Its an issue for the military as hep-b carriers are not deployable. CDC recommends all infants get it...and if im a parent 2 shots sounds better than 3. 
2. That same adjuvant is being used in a covid vaccine in [partnership with clover](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/clover-and-dynavax-announce-planned-global-phase-2-3-efficacy-trial-of-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/)
3. Gross profit TTM DEC 2020 was positive 6.5m, DEC 2019 this was -37.3m. This seems like the right direction
4. Financials aren't all that impressive...but hey maybe [new CFO Kelly MacDonald](https://investors.dynavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dynavax-appoints-kelly-macdonald-chief-financial-officer) \- formerly of Ironwood - can make it pop.

6. Shares for new SVP can be exercised at $11.18, for Ms. MacDonald its $8.90...both above the current price. This probably means nothing but maybe extra motivation if they are not making shit on their shares

68,m0xsof,"Heads up, autists... the resurgence of Blackberry is beginning. $BB stock jumped over 3% today and broke through multi-month resistance. Why is it starting to run? the reason is that it’s a solid post-COVID recovery play.

The company’s recent movement comes largely from the announcement by the US President Joe Biden that electric vehicles (EV) – and other green energy initiatives – will see massive investment worth billions of dollars. Even better, President Biden stated he would be changing 650,000 federal vehicles into EVs. BlackBerry stock could rise as its QNX software remains at the forefront of autonomous vehicle use where security is a major issue.

I'd pay attention to 1) the chart action 2) evidence of increasing QNX adoption by automotive manufacturers 3) Low implied volatility on the options. I’m long the stock via Jan 2022 25c

Feel free to share with fellow apes.

**LYRICS:**

Hit em with the memes, you know what I mean?

Hit em with the memes, you know what I mean?

**Verse1:**

Diamond hands, diamond hands,

Hodlng til on the moon we land,

Hodling til we land on Mars,

Hodling til we’re past the stars

A dumb ape, d\*generate money

Or so they say, I play my cards funny,

And with it my rockets running

Ready for blastoff gamestop coming

For at least a 100k

Maybe a milli or so they say

Don’t be silly I’ll never sell

Til these hedgies burn in hell

That’s right I’ll never sell,

Don’t matter how you scream and yell,

These games y’all keep playin

It’s time to get payin

For ‘08 the crimes, all the nickel and diming

And even then, it’s blasting higher, a new world, with a new buyer

the gamer is changing and paving the way

so what do you say? dare you play with a player, or say your prayers?

Or do you even care, your hate so dismissive,

Pretending it wasn’t you who did this, complicit, who is it

that is feeding you all dem lies,

yes I know that you tried, explicit, implicit, exquisite, more digits

We need more zeroes behind that 1,

Joe Biden let it run, let gamers have their fun,

and onto the moon we come

Apekind in outerspace, without a trace

of the evil behind us, let us not remind us of our mistakes

That we leave in the past, and lets not make it last, so we can move on fast to a new world and generation

The space ape gamer confederation

Is the one nation to unite under

No need to wonder how we make it past

ego-filled greed and cheats,

looking real beat, they weep,

hop to this beat, gamestop bananas we eat

do what we do, gme crew, buy, hodl, wait until we flew

Way past the moon, it’s coming soon, and

never let go, lamers say no, that’s how we know the squeeze is a go,

don’t take it slow, bc it’s time for sure,

and they put on a show, mass manipulation,

they testing ape patience, but diamond hands is all we do 💎🙌

**Bridge:**

That’s all we do that’s all we do!

Diamond hands! Diamond hands!

Buy hodl buy hodl

**Verse2:**

Hedgies With their shares shorted, a grave deeper than hell,

they cannot abort it we got a Roaring kitty

as well as simple apes, a clash of faith, a mighty battle of fate, to push us to the gates, we won’t be late to GameStop,

make this game stop, no more lies no more cries of fake news of gme being pumped up cuz why

Its a new world, a new way, gamers get their say, it’s who these hedgies feared while they were cheating that day,

miserable fools with their money foolishly on display, so we can hang on you apes, this final boss we’ll slay

Without delay, we’ll grind til the time is right DFV, Domo, apes y’all all helped shined the light, end is in sight we shall fight to slay this beast together with diamonds hands high, that’s right,

THIS IS THE WAY!

All of Our might

Faith without sight, all day and all night, depth of their fright, emojis we type, these memes are spicy and ripe,

These apes are reaching new heights, get ready for flight

We gotta do what is right

Do our due diligence and consensus we trust,

The evil try to split us with lust,

For money give up, it’s rough

But diamonds hands will hold tough because its love because its us it’s who we trust

And we must, never give in to them or give up

Diligent apes gaming to find a new plus

That’s a positive way to keep us away from the rust, keep evil at bay, fade it to dust, we are the gust, blow it away, don’t let it sway you Ok?

When they come asking for this, or asking for that, remember 08 because they skate with words and lie to your face

Keep pace, keep space away from the FUD

Coming from duds a literal disgrace to apes and all shapes

So save for only what you really need, we need as many apes to take on the machine, that grinds us to dust

**Outro:**

Cede and company, is trying to take a seat in your brain and operate you from behind the machine

That’s C E D E. They own the dtcc. There’s no names of who operate this shell. Let’s find the board and man behind the machine

So yeah don’t cede yourself to cede co. Check em out. Again they’re part of the dtcc. That’s the depository trust and clearing corporation. They take your money and try to take your mind body and soul, but they can’t.
