49,m248be,"***TLDR:*** Stick to GME or AMC for quick tendies, buy SKT shares as a longer-term play (\~1 year-ish)

Tanger Factory Outlets Centers (SKT) was fucked during the onset of Covid and has been beat down by Banks and Hedge Funds on the belief that Retail is dead making Tanger the 2nd most shorted stock. I read over their February 10k and came away with a strong belief in them. Tanger seems to have a recipe that works with their outlet design and has made a number of smart consolidating decisions over the past quarters to ensure their continued existence while returning to Pre-Covid levels of sales and activity by January. Despite some claims that Tanger is the next GME I don’t see that case. It has the potential to explode later this year, with May or August earnings providing the action that could ignite the existing kindling, but Tanger is definitely a long-term hold stock rather than an FD or weekly options play. I would aim for a price of $20-$25 by summer's end. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below is my overview, cons, pros, and what I see as a reasonable future path.

&amp;#x200B;

***Company Overview:*** Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. They are a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2020, their consolidated portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.9 million square feet, which were 92% occupied and contained over 2,200 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. They also had partial ownership interests in 7 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

***Cons:*** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Getting fucked by Covid and negatives consumer trends related to their business model have made them the 2nd most shorted company behind GME:** The main factors behind their current position are that they have been fucked by Covid and the fact that they are at their core a collection of huge retail brand store fronts off the highway.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tenant Bankruptcies and Defaults:** In context to Covid a large number of their stores were closed, some rents payments were delayed, and there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers at their locations (an increase in recovered square footage from about 1.75% at end of 2019 to about 8.3% of rentable square feet in 2020). Some of the tenants went through liquidity hardships and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tanger recaptured approximately 903,000 square feet within the consolidated portfolio related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, compared to 198,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a direct result of the pandemic, bankruptcies, and restructurings discussed above, the Company's earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $47.3 million due to (1) write-offs related to bankruptcies and other uncollectible accounts due to financial weakness, (2) one-time concessions in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to lease structure, (3) reserves for a portion of deferred and under negotiation billings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Most Likely will not Increase Rent:** Tanger’s leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain Tanger’s standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of Tanger’s leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. Tanger has historically been able to renew many leases at higher base rents per-square-foot and replace underperforming tenants with new or existing tenants in Tanger’s portfolio. Given the current retail environment as discussed above, Tanger may choose to renew certain tenants or execute leases with new tenants at lower rental rates to maintain a high portfolio occupancy rate. This is some of their lease agreements include co-tenancy and/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if Tanger fails to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. Their occupancy at our consolidated centers has declined from 97% at the end of 2019 to 92% at the end of 2020. If their occupancy continues to decline, certain outlet centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact their results of operations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Retail decline:** Certain retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet, and other forms of pressure on their business models.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Pros:***

&amp;#x200B;

**Tangers Model/Outlet Centers:** Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third-party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential while also allowing these brands to maintain a foothold in high-density population centers without a high-cost storefront.

Tanger’s consolidated outlet centers range in size from 104,009 to 739,110 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores (so outskirts of major cities). Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Most of their outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, their centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers. 

They have a diverse tenant base throughout their consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 manufacturers, brand name and discount apparel and home retailers.

No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of their combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no single tenant accounted for more than 7% of their leasable square feet or 7% of their combined base and percentage rental revenues.

&amp;#x200B;

Tenants: 

 

Locations: 

**Perk of REITS for dividends.** Because Tanger is a REIT the ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of their common shares. They also have to make distributions with respect to their then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of their taxable income each year. They froze their dividends in 2020 but reinstated them in early 2021 with a dividend of $0.1775 per share paid in February 2021. Because of this high dividend payout holding the stock at least gives the benefit of decent dividends while waiting for a potential squeeze. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Return from Covid:** As of December 31, 2020, 99.9% of total occupied stores in their consolidated portfolio had reopened, representing 99.9% of leased square footage and 99.9% of the annualized base rent. 

(Checkout Tenants and location attachment)

A number of their tenants requested rent deferrals, rent abatements or other types of rent relief during this pandemic. For March 2020, Tanger offered all tenants the option to defer 100% of April and May rents interest-free, payable in equal installments due in January and February of 2021. Their rent collection rates on contractually billed fixed rents were significantly impacted during the second quarter but steadily improved during the second half of the year, as the Company collected approximately 63% of second-quarter billed rents, 91% of third-quarter billed rents, and 95% of fourth-quarter billed rents. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

(checkout rent attachment)

In addition, traffic during the fourth quarter represented approximately 90% of prior-year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January. Governmental mandates effective between late December and early-to mid-February impacted traffic at the Tanger Outlet Centers in Canada, and excluding those centers, domestic traffic was over 99% in January compared to prior-year levels. This is a ridiculously good sign that there returning to pre-covid levels of demand even though only 20% of the US has been vaccinated. With a stimulus bill passing on the horizon, pent-up consumer demand,  and a planned influx of people traveling along highways and going to vacation destinations where Tanger has outlets I would not be surprised if they had stellar summer earnings. This would be the gasoline for a potential share price jump but wouldn’t be enough to kick off a squeeze. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, let's talk about what I think could be the item that kicks off a short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

***Share Repurchases :***

 In May 2017, Tanger announced that their Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125 million of their outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019. In February 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $44.3 million of their outstanding common shares for an aggregate authorization of $169.3 million until May 2021. After purchases in 2019 and 2018 the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $80.0 million. The Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases for at least twelve months starting July 1, 2020 as the June 2020 amendments to Tanger’s debt agreements for Tanger’s lines of credit and bank term loan prohibit share repurchases during such time and in order to preserve Tanger’s liquidity position.

&amp;#x200B;

What does this mean? Tanger has a pretty sizeable share repurchasing power that is currently on hold due to their debt agreements from when they shored up their lines of credit and borrowing power in 2020. Because their share repurchasing power will be authorized until May 2021 there is a chance that at their 5/10 Earnings Report they could roll that ability forward to this next year (2021-2022) and when their share purchasing restrictions drop on July 1st, 2021 they could announce a share purchase program where just under 5 million shares could be bought back by the company. This would provide the desired squeeze effect and really put pressure on the shorts assuming they don’t take the time to cover between now and then.

&amp;#x200B;
