30,m359fw,"Im no time traveler or DFV prodigy, just someone who has been following this stock and similar ones and noticed an opportunity.

I have been heavily involved with MILE and LMND. When the market correction started to happen I decided just to pull out my positions at a 20% loss once they started falling and just sat on the sidelines watching.

Like almost every stock during this time, they dipped. I was doing some DD to see if it was just the correction causing it to fall or underlying issues. I couldnt find anything so I bought the dip at 20%. Then it continued to fall and I pulled out after it fell another 10%. I was down \~55% overall and decided to just sit out and watch it and try to get some grasp of what was happening.

I stayed out and spent my time watching it and trying to find why it fell so much. After about three weeks of mass decline it held around 40-45% down. While I cant claim that I know the exact reasoning to why it dropped so hard, I have a pretty solid theory thats held up so far.

The main stocks I was looking into were LMND and MILE. Disclaimer this is only my theory/take obtained from watching and looking into these stocks for the past three weeks give or take. They didn't fall so much because of fundamentals or financial problems.

In fact they both had large surpluses of cash with minimal debt. They also were some of the proment leading/emerging companies in their respective areas. One factor was because they were rather new ipos, less than 1 year old, and because of their shown success the stock(s) rose rather quickly. They were at their all time highs, which they achieved rather quickly, when the correction happened.

The correction caused some amount of people to panic thinking it was a potential market crash and sold these rapidly growing stocks. This was also coupled with a fair amount of shorting. This cause the price to start to plummet rather aggressively in a short time. Now most people already had the thought of ""its gonna crash any day now"" in the back of their mind. Rumors of a a potential market crash, the extremely fast growing stock, a large panic sell off, and other factors, combined to triggered a mass panic selling which just kept going.

When the market stopped dipping and it was shown to be just a correction, these stocks remained somewhat stagnant at their respectively dropped prices (LMND 88-95 from 160, MILE 9-10 from 20). I also noticed this was when it was not very clear if the market would become bullish or bearish. I also noticed when it was a ""good day(up 1-3%)"" for the spy during that time these stocks would go up 3-5%. If it was a ""bad day (down 1-3%)"" for the spy during this time these stocks would go down 3-5%.

I also went and confirmed that nothing had really changed with these companies fundamentally since all this happened. I had the speculation that if the market showed signs and started to be bullish these stocks would start soaring again because (personally) they were way undervalued.

I felt that the only sure thing to get the market rolling was the stimulus check. I waited until there was news the stimulus passed in the senate (saturday) and got a bunch of positions for LMND and MILE. They finally started moving the next day and then the next. Then today I got more because Biden signed the stimulus and encouraged others to do the same. I felt this would guarantee more movement with checks coming in in the coming weeks. Now im still bullish on LMND but just with the positions I have now as it appears to really be getting priced in. It's a rather expensive stock and call for what money I have to play with at 100+.

Now I feel MILE, without dragging this on for another three pages, is very bullish at its price now and I will be and recommend buying some stock.

Total profit: 500,000\*31 = $15,500,000

CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? It's because we sold the shares for MORE than what we bought it for. WOW.

Question: but you sold it for $500,000 how did you get $15,497,024?

Answer: OH, GREAT question young one. It's because we bought 31 shares. Meaning we sell every share for $500,000 each! $500,000 sold 31 times is $15,497,024.

81,m35klm,"On Tuesday evening, I decided to uplift my spirits with some tendies to mediate my 5 figure unrealized loss from absolute bullshit that the HF and media coordinated. 

It was odd, the line was so long that it was blocking traffic from the road. Took me 30 minutes to reach the cashier and place my order. 

Anyways.

This had me thinking, why the fuck are there so many people buying tendies on a Tuesday? Encapsulated with rage, my brain grew a wrinkle and was enlightened by a hypothesis. 

*Does the price of Gamestonke have a direct impact on chicky nuggy sales? I mean, after all, isn't the short squ33ze is what this is all about? Increasing our tendies? Why is nobody talking about this?*

&amp;#x200B;

[10 pc Demand Curve after SS](https://preview.redd.it/1p3c740cohm61.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f99afdaf0d34c875a5ff5911478fcc4db1275c1)

At the moment, there are 9.5 million WSB users, each and every one very capable of consuming AT LEAST one 10 piece meal alone. For the smoothbrains, that's 90.5 million chicken nuggets without any squeeze.  Once the MO@SS does occur, I suspect the daily demand will at least **double** following the squ3ez3.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zghatoabphm61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9988b814d08384ef05db3f43d0f209806cdba79

Though I could not find the exact population of chickens in 2021 in the United States, the most recent data shows that there is currently about 39,035,000 chickens. Additionally, I suspect that each chicken is capable of producing 35 nuggets each. 

SO

\~40,000,000 \* 35 = **1,400,000,000 Potential Nuggets**

With 9.5 million apes purchasing 2 x 10 piece nuggets everyday, we experience the greatest tendie shortages we have ever seen within only ***7.37 days.*** 

You may argue that the raising price of tendies will cause consumers to switch to indirect substitutes such as hamburgers/hotdogs, BeyondMeat chicken, etc. You are correct about the rational consumer, however, I am talking about us absolute fucking retards. After the sque3ze, the vast majority of the nation's wealth will lie in the hands of WSB autists. WSB will become so rich that these other substitutes will become [inferior goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp),  thus only driving the price of tendies towards the moon. 

Soon, the demand and value for tendies  will be so high that there will be no need paper currencies. *Just tendies.*  

**TLDR:**  **The short sque3z3 will transfer wealth to WSB users, thus causing SUDDEN surge of tendies demanded, then following a shortage. The commodity will become invaluable, thus replacing the need for USD currency.**
