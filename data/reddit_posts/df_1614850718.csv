66,lxhdv7,"I've made something to analyze the entire options chain to reveal gamma ramps, charm zones, and IV crush sensitivity -- as it all pertains to theoretical MM delta hedging.  Here's the table for GME.  Feedback is welcomed, as well as your interpretations of the data.

**Faqs:**

* **What is this?**: I take the entire options chain and calculate how many shares options writers theoretically need to delta hedge. This is done for various price points, and at each price point the delta shares' sensitive to price, time, and volatility change are included as well.
* **Why?**: This gives a rough indication of the gamma ramp, as well as what effects changes in price, time, and volatility will have on the flux of delta shares... in theory.
* **About Delta Hedging**: This table provides *only the theoretical amount of delta hedging required.* MM's and other option writers may hedge in a variety of ways non-exclusive to delta hedging.  They may also front-run, or back-run delta hedging (buy shares ahead of time, or after the fact). They may also have a strategy as to how they wish to roll over delta hedged shares from one week to the next, since not all ITM necessarily get delivered.
* **How do I interpret this?**: This data is open for interpretation however you please. In general, price points with high ""1% Price ‚àÜflux"" values are high gamma regions -- the stock price should theoretically move with higher volatility through these regions. Price points with high ""24hr ‚àÜflux"" values are high charm regions -- time will cause # deltashares to change.  Price points with high ""10% vol ‚àÜflux"" values are high vanna regions -- IV crush or explosion will have a large effect on # deltashares.
* **Note: This cannot predict price action**: It's up to you to have an outlook on how the actual price and volatility may change throughout the day.  This only gives you a rough idea of how the tides of deltashares can roll in and out based on your outlook.

**Columns:**

* **Price Point**: The stock price that this row assumes the underlying is at.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged**: At the price point, the theoretical number of shares needed for the entire options chain to be delta hedged.  This is sum total of all contracts' open interest multiplied by their delta and by 100.
* **1% Price DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to price (~gamma). At the price point, a price movement of 1% will change # Shares DeltaHedged by this much.
* **24hr DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to time (~charm). At the price point, if time elapsed 24hours the # Shares DeltaHedged would change by this much.
* **10% Vol DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to Volatility (~vanna). At the price point, if across the entire options chain the implied volatility of each contract increased by 1.10x its current value (eg: from 140% to 154%), the # Shares DeltaHedged would change by this.
