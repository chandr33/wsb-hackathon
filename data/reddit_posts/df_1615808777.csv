12,m5izy7,"Listen up Apes, 

Last week was absolutely admirable. We took a severe beating from the hedgies, but we crawled back up, found our foxholes and dug in even deeper. For a bunch of crayon-eating unorganised retards sprawled all over the globe that is BEYOND AMAZING. 

But digging in into our foxholes is good to protect ourselves from being shelled to bits and bobs, but to win the war we need to ADVANCE to the frontlines.

And to get to the frontlines, we need **VOLUME**. We need to move the market. We cannot just sit on our shares and shit and do nothing. We need to increase the buying volume.

Papa Joe is taking care of the logistics and has pumped a stimmy in most of you apes' asses. No put it to work and BUY SHARES.

Think of it in terms of ENTROPY. 

Entropy is central to the [second law of thermodynamics](http://www.scholarpedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_law_of_thermodynamics&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1), which states that in an isolated system any activity increases the entropy. We're in an isolated system here. It's us against the world. And we're not moving much.

For the moment we're all dig in snugly and THEY can't hurt us much be WE can't hurt them much either. That's why we're in the left bit of the image here. We're a highly ordered snug fit. But to blow the fuck out of these fuckers, we need to INCREASE THE ENTROPY. We need to get the wheels spinning buy increasing the volume, which will increase the entropy which will increase the havoc and disorderly nature of the system we're in (fucking market) and ultimately make the entire thing explode and get us 500k$ shares each and golden lambos.

As usual, physics to the rescue in order to explain something.

*Processing img mk7kggvt46n61...*

To get a rocket to MARS you need to have an explosion. 

TLDR : small balloon, no volume, no boom, no mars. To get to mars we need big balloon, big volume, big boom, big Mars. 

Now we need to get from the SOLID form that we're now in to a more LIQUID form. That's where your stimmies get in action : they are the LIQUIDUITY needed to enter the final phase of GAS where things will go BIG BOOM. And remember : BIG BOOM = MARS

31,m5j3uy,"Hey guys, I have a dumb math question to ask. I studied literature and therefore am terrible with numbers  😬


If I have a share at 150$ it means that if  a share reach a value of 300$ I would have made 100% gain. 
If I sell 50% of my holdings I would get my initial investment back (150$). 

This equal to : 150x200% = 300$ 

Now let’s say I want 25% of my share to cover my initial investment, does that mean I need to do :

150x225% = 337$

Which means if a share has a value of 337$, selling 25% of my share would get my initial investment back? 

As same for 10% 

150x290% = 435$

A share would have to reach 435$ to sell 10% of my holdings and get my initial investment back.

73,m5jdhh,"Disclaimer:  Not financial advice. This is just something extra and i dont wanna  shill RKT. GME is still king. However i wanted to run it by you guys and  see if I'm not mistaken.

I'm thinking about buying RKT at market open and selling by end of week.I cant play options cuz europoor.

So  the logic is this: Special dividend is on march 23rd and i dont think  people wont sell until then so risk is minimal. In general it could drop  to 20 long term but i can take that risk. Open interest on call options  is at 200.000 OTM call options at 30 and below. Even like 100.000 more  between 30-50. If those calls get ITM there could be a huge gamma  squeeze as banks would need to hedge up to 30 million shares+. Thats 30%  of the float.

The Problem:  
RKT  has a market cap of almost 50 billion. However the float is only at 2.5  billion right now. Most shares are tied up with instutions and i think  the CEO has like 75% of all shares. Dont hold me to those numbers but it  looks something like that. Also as far as i understand the float  consists of class A(no voting power) shares and the  institutions/insiders own mostly class D(voting power) shares which are  convertible to class A shares.(I'm probably retarded and this isnt true)

So  the question is do the banks and institutional investors who own most  of the stock sell the options and already have the underlying or do the  banks need to purchase the underlying from float and there giving the  possibility of a gamma squeeze. Also are they able to just ""sell"" their  shares thru options this way diluting the float? I mean the option  sellers would make money anyway because of premium + yuge profit since  they prolly bought at &lt;20.

TLDR:

Im  betting on a gamma squeeze since float is only 2-3 billion(high option  activity). Problem is if option sellers already have the shares or need  to purchase them to cover.",Gimme your opinion on RKT play this week.,1.0,1615810501,brokester
