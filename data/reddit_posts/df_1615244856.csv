5,m0ssdr,"Was thinking of doing two GME and Then 20 AMC and the rest into itty bitty. I allocate about 30% of my portfolio to the creepiest asset class as I feel like it’s a good thing to have some portion in a class that doesn’t directly correlate to equities.

Does anyone else think like me on here as I know WSB it’s a market mover at this point and was just interested to see if anyone does anything like I do or if you all go all in on equities all the time. Would expect to see a crypt keeper bump with this check if there are a solid amount of people in on here who do as I do.

Thoughts? Or does pretty much everyone but me on here stay in 100% equities.

15,m0su5n,"Half of this dang subreddit seems to be on the RBLX DPO 🚂 for Wednesday 3.10.21 (otherwise known as 3tac10). It’s a big day but you need to prepare yourself for the limitations trading platforms put on IPOs and DPOs.

If you’re buying into the hype so you can sit upon a throne of psa 10 charizards and use your wife’s boyfriend as a footrest you’re going to need to deposit that cash you plan to spend tonight/tomorrow latest. These trading apps require funds to be officially deposited and taken from your bank account before they can be used to buy “risky” IPO and DPO stocks. That means “instant cash” “gold cash” and other forms of quick credit provided to depositors won’t be available when purchasing Roblox. Unfortunately Robux can’t be used to purchase roblox either :(

Free up capital and get that nervous pre rope out now so you can last a long time for roblox. The big money comes from DPOs. She thinks she’s special. If you pop too quick she won’t be returning that text. The big players are competing with you for shares in that sweet girl known as RBLX in t-minus 39 hours. You need to be prepared.

🚨 Fair warning 🚨 
Be prepared to lose everything you put in. 

Unlike the intelligible stock choices made by our battlefield legends like DFV, there is no data to support this or any DPO. Hype means more than numbers, no one knows how high or how low the stock can go, and only the grit and strength of the calluses on the itchy trigger fingers of our little degenerate meme stonk trading hands will determine when the stock takes a dive.

One thing is for sure, if you’re sitting at your desk at 0930 on 3tac10 what you put in will pop 🍾 whether or not you can read the room as to when to sell will determine if that fat stack of debt you can’t afford to lose becomes the gold for your new RuneScape membership or a deeper less forgiving hole of regret that will keep you up at night.

As for the me. I like the stock.

I know it’s a terrible idea. So, I’m in!

I have nothing to lose. She wants it. I know she’s dirty. I let that pre rope fly so she thinks she’s just another girl. Nothing special. I can last all night. And when I don’t return her text the next day. That’s when I’ve got her. That’s when I sell.",Pre-Rope for RBLX. Don’t let her know she’s special.,1.0,1615245095,newfrontierpolitics

1. Backed by the CCP

“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))

The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Reasons for recent price movements

There are two causes for the recent price movements, and neither of them are particularly valid. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:

* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3
* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3
* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3
* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3

While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.

The second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))

&amp;#x200B;

3. Market Cap compared to competitors

$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Potential for future growth

Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.

$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j

&amp;#x200B;

5. The actual products

In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for one hour before being able to drive 44 miles(source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.

**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.

81,m0t6js,"In 2009 I was working for a Wall Street firm supplying a network of industry experts to our hedge fund clients. Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he'd just left the company. I didn't know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd's only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I'd make sure we had that.
On any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn't listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information wanted to stay out of prison. They said I probably knew what was going on but had no emails or recordings to back that up. They all walked and I got hammered with a 30 month prison sentence. So that's how you go to prison for insider trading without actually trading. It's all true!
