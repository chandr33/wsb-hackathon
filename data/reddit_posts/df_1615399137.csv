13,m23wyv,"# What’s happening right now?

Hedge funds’ balls start to feel the burn so they try what they can. They are pushing a lot of their shares at once therefore pushing the price down.

Retail retards are not selling therefore **NOTHING HAS CHANGED**! If we don’t get scared the price will be back super quickly.

# So what should you do?

Buy the freaking discounted shares. This is the best oportunity ever.

We can cry how bad they are or we can take their money. They are trying to fuck us but they are rather giving as free fucking money.

&amp;#x200B;

If we buy these shitton of super discouted shares what they are throwing to the market, we will be 10X better situation afterwards. **BUY THE DIP APES!**
