30,m5er2n," I know your fucking here and saw your post right before it got removed. Im guessing it removed you because you didnt post in the daily discussion. I dont know who you are, and have been trying to search reddit/wsb for you so if you see this all credit is yours and this is for you. 

everyone is making money on gme i get it, thats great. I do hold a small position but missed the bus early and really try to get in businesses that are newer to the market. Im also not a HEdGe FuNd iNfILtraToR nAzI either and have been in wsb for fucking years and with multiple accounts. With that beind said this post is for retards that are looking to diversify and and are looking for something other than what is consistently pumped here.

This is my due diligence and yes you can lick my retarded ape bunghole if you dont like it. Im not an investor or qualified to give advice i am a retard. 

Listen up smooth brains. First things first, even analysts have this at a 91% buy 9 percent hold, 0% sell, so im not really your gospel hear. Reguardless of that i did some digging to see for myself.  Wecently i posted about rkt before it took off and even didnt sell. 🙌💎. at its most recent peak of measly 42. Thats in my post history and you can look for youself. I also had a huge play about 2 months ago and got in at .007 the day before a certain unnamed dog themed investment coin went parabolic over %150. With this in mind im feelin ballsy and willing to throw my shit at the wall and say my next money shot is going to be the company Go Health. 



 First this is thier 2020 4th quarter earnings is on youtube and it wont let me post the link on here. 

GO HEALTH : GOCO
Is a website/app that acts as a broker service to guide customers looking for health care plans with a current focus on medicare. The process of picking out health care plans is kind of a pain in the ass if your not getting it through work, Especially if your getting through the government and even further if your elderly. This company releaves these problems by highly training brokers in their own systems and feeding the brokers clients for personal 1v1 attention to guide them through and set up their new health insurance plans. With a focus on the elderly you can see where a company like this would help in being able to provide relieve/value. Because of that value customers are already willing to pay a premium but by taking advantage of mass they have go health had the ability to charge less premium than traditional standards. With their focus in government funded healthcare and fast joe now at the wheel there is no where to go but up. They have been in business for about 20 years and hold about 70 percent of a current un-realized market. They most recently have started to heavily invest back into the company since the biden win and i believe are going to try carving out a massive part of the 30 billion online health care market during this new admissestransation and are currently trading at 10 dollars a share. Go health went public late last summer and my guess is, had an early investors cashing in and that has made this bad boy go on sale. Listen to the earnings call linked above. Its just under hour long and you will understand what this company is about to do. Testicles.",GOCO go health To the fucking moon. DD inside bitches.,1.0,1615790914,lilrockerboy4

* NIO Limited designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV. The company was formerly known as NextEV Inc. and changed its name to NIO Limited in July 2017. NIO Limited was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Shanghai, China. 
   * ELI12
      * Sells and manufactures a variety of luxury cars
      * Offers a multitude of charging solutions
      * Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car)
      * Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance

**Catalysts**

*  European Market Expansion
   * [https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/](https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/02/27/chinese-nio-electric-cars-europe/)
      * Nio plants to enter European markets in the second half of 2021 and other onlother internetational markets in 2022. – CEO William Li at an online conference, February 2021. 
      * “Analysts suggest that Norway may be the first European market for NIO.
      *  ”Nomura analysts predict that it will jump to over $80 within the next few months, if it continues to meet delivery targets.
   * Rapid Clean Tech Movement
   * New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors
   * NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year
   * Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages

 **Analyst Consensus**

**This shows how NIO is undervalued at this time. Here is a compilation of price targets.**

* Morgan Stanley: $80
* J.P. Morgan: $75
* Deutsche: $70
* Bank of America: $70
* Goldman Sachs: $64
* Daiwa: $100

 **Why buy NIO…**

* Good growth opportunity
* Good market (Local environment too)
*  Good strategic approach
* The banks have price targets way above where it is now (i.e. $45.50 as of 3/12/21)
* Great strategic approach. 
* Great management
* Many are calling William Li a genius and the “Elon Musk of China.”
* One thing that NIO has done exceptionally well where Tesla failed is their battery-swapping tech. So as a buyer of a NIO fleet vehicle you have the option to purchase with or without a battery. If you choose not to purchase a battery you can sign up for a battery subscription service by paying a monthly fee and use one of NIO’s battery swap-stations to exchange your run down battery for a fully charged one. Think of it like a gas station but with batteries instead. 
   * This is smart of NIO to pursue this type of program especially in China where most individuals aren’t living in large houses with the ability to install a charging station directly into their garage wall. For that reason alone NIO seems like a better choice for an EV vehicle if you are living in densely populated areas with little to no space.
* China’s market share on a global scale is massive and one thing China does often is promote and back their own companies over US. China is very competitive and loves to win and get out on top. In my opinion China wants to produce EV companies that not only compare with Tesla but overall outperform and take a bigger piece of the EV-pie.
* NIO is being touted as China’s Tesla.
* NIO also understands that while people are paying for the subscription service - sometimes they just don’t drive. NIO’s subscription service keeps customers paying month to month even after that initial sale. 
* China won’t let their EV companies fail.
* China has stated that they want 25% of all new vehicles sold in the country to be electric by 2025. Currently EV sales are only contributing to about 5%. So in the next four years we’re going to see an EV boom all across China. That means the government would likely be installing more charging stations across the country and possibly kickbacks for citizens who purchase EV.
* It’s no secret that the emissions in China are insane. It sure would be nice for China to be able to come out in a few years and say, “Hey look at how much we improved.” I believe this is exactly what’s going to happen especially when you really look at the policies the Chinese government has put in place for electric vehicles vs. combustion engine vehicles.

54,m5f3zz,"Imma keep this plain and simple and not post a long ass DD like I had originally planned since I’m sleepy as hell lol. $WWR aka WestWater Resources is a  battery graphite business serves the green energy storage sector – making the electrification of our transportation and renewable energy power systems more efficient and accessible to people all over the world. Last year around October they had sold off their Uranium business in order to go completely into graphite mining game and have stocked up about 50 million in cash from the sale. This saw the stock price jump all the way to $14.5 from $1.5. Best part? Currently they are the ONLY graphite mining company in the USA with the rights to the COOSA COUNTY mine in Alabama. They are currently running feasibility research and expect results around mid 2020. Last week President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order signed on February 24, 2021, that seeks to provide for more resilient supply chains to revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity and maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development. A few days later, Energy Secretary Granholm said she wants the U.S. to produce more EV minerals. Why is this? It’s because a week prior China, currently the largest exporter or rare earth metals (Graphite included) had signed new laws to cut back on global exports by up to 60%. But the sudden craze? Well it’s no secret that electric vehicles needs graphite and what’s the biggest electric trend of the year and hopes for the future? EVs. Lastly, this company has been HEAVILY SHORTED over the past few weeks. I’ll leave a link below because my dumb ass doesn’t know how to attach a screenshot but this links you to the amount of shares traded daily and how much are shorted. On average 50% shorted daily and with ONLY A 25 MILLION FLOAT. Now this shit is getting much longer than I hoped so I’ll leave with this tid bit that I had known for a while but heard echoed again from the PGIR podcast: they have mentioned Tesla in their official filings. Obviously no deal has been struck nor does this mean they will but I felt like it would be worth mentioning. 

Please do your research, this is not financial advice nor am I an advisor.

Total net revenue was $15.7 billion, there are 115.37M outstanding shares which give us EPS of 15.7b/115.37m = 136.904 EPS.

Now PE ratio is the currently:

current market value per share/earnings per share(EPS) 

which equals 25.01/136.904 = 0.1826 which is fking amazing... 

Now please correct my math, if it's right going to sky rocket high, very f high.
