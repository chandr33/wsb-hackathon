UUUU, or Energy Fuels, is a uranium mining company. Why did they have a good day today in a so-so day for the market? Well it must be because all uranium stocks are doing well today, and Energy Fuels is part of that trend, right? Is there anything else?

In my opinion, what makes Energy Fuels special would have to be its entry into REE, otherwise known as Rare Earth Elements. Most people associate only MP Materials (which I bought a lot of earlier this year) with rare earths. MP Materials mines rare earths in the US. UUUU is not a miner of rare earths. So how do they fit in?

In what I view as a very clever arrangement, Energy Fuels has put themselves right in the middle of the value chain for rare earths. You can read [here](https://www.energyfuels.com/2021-03-01-Neo-Performance-Materials-and-Energy-Fuels-Announce-Joint-Launch-of-U-S-European-Rare-Earth-Production-Initiative) their announcement, but here's how it works (skip this part if you're bored): 

tldr: Chemours-&gt;Energy Fuels-&gt;Neo =&gt; non-China rare earths supply chain

1. In December, Energy Fuels announced a supply agreement with Chemours, where Chemours will now ship a minimum of 2,500 tons of Monazite Ore per year to Energy Fuels. Monazite contains rare earths, and previously, Chemours shipped this monazite to China for processing. Chemours has this monazite as a result of its mining operations in the state of Georgia. Energy Fuels is able to process this monazite by removing the uranium (which it then stockpiles for selling later on). 
2. Some important details about the monazite it processes. In one unit of monazite ore from Georgia, there is 53% total rare earth oxide (treo). In this treo, there is 22.6% NdPr (Neodymium Praseodymium) and 14.4% SEG/Heavies (the specific rare earths being mined). Other monazite ores from around the world contain even higher amounts, but that's not important right now.
3. To compare, of the treo in US bastnaesite, which is what MP Materials mines, there is 16.3% NdPr and 1.1% SEG/Heavies. So by this point, we can see that what Energy Fuels produces will be higher quality treo than MP. I mentioned the 2500 tons because even if the treo is higher, what if MP mines more overall? However, the 2500 is a minimum shipping amount that can increase as demand grows, and Energy Fuels can also source monazite from other companies as well. So over the next year, the quantities will converge, but the quality will still be on Energy Fuels' side. 
4. But at this point, both companies are still shipping their REE carbonate to China for processing. This is where the Trump and Biden administrations come in. Both the previous administration and the current administration want to create a US-based supply chain for rare earths. As relations between China and the US deteriorate in the long-term, the US government does not want its rare earths to be beholden to China. MP Materials, according to their own website, still ships their output to China for processing, negating the idea that their rare earth supply chain is US-based.
5. Here's where the announcement yesterday of the partnership with Neo comes in. [Neo](https://www.neomaterials.com/) Performance Materials is a European producer of materials and chemicals for various purposes. They are the last step in the supply chain for creating marketable, usable rare earth elements. Now, Energy Fuels will ship their REE carbonate to Neo for processing. This is the first completely non-China based supply chain for rare earths, which is a high priority for the US government/Biden administration. They currently support Lynas, so the question now is whether Energy Fuels will play a more prominent role in the government's efforts. They have an existing relationship with the government, as you can see through their recent lobbying [efforts](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/20/campaign-contributions/). This article is important to note, as it sheds a light on some not-so-savory relationships. While everything seems above the table and fine, I'm just not a big fan of lobbying and such. However the point I see is that if Energy Fuels has the ability to maintain a rare earths value chain, the US government will pay attention to it. 

Phew, that was a lot. Now let's go through the pros and cons for UUUU. Feel free to add your own too. 

\- Con:

the rare earth supply that UUUU hopes to produce through its partnership with Chemours and Neo is just beginning. It doesn't yet match the output of MP Materials or Lynas, at least not that I can tell. 

\+ Pro:

According to all the CNBC I watched last year, ""markets look ahead by 6 months"". I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, then the stock price won't wait to catch up to production outputs. Additionally, CNBC has never once mentioned this company and their go-to response whenever anything rare earth related comes up is MP. That's fine with me seeing as I own lots of MP, but it just seems totally inaccurate and lazy to me. 

\- Con:

The US government [currently supports Lynas](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/us-dod-rare-earth-metals-contract-lynas-china-hondo-texas/). Interestingly, and I don't know if this is good or bad, MP and UUUU are the only rare earth related stocks tradeable on the NYSE. If Lynas were on the NYSE, I might feel slightly differently about all this. Of course, they are not a uranium producer. With Energy Fuels' new supply chain, if I were the US government, I'd take a hard look at UUUU's rare earth production. 

\+ Pro:

the company has zero debt. 

\- Con:

They just announced a 300mm mixed shelf, which to the best of my understanding could be very dilutive to shareholders (ie not good for the stock price), but is also a sign that they are planning major investments. Open to being educated on the effects of shelf offerings.

\+ Pro:

I've talked a lot about rare earths, which they are just entering into. Let's get back to uranium. Why are people so bullish on uranium? The market cap of the top 50 uranium companies in the world recently hit a high of $1.3T. This reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) from last year called the start of the bull market for uranium. Why?

To the best of my understanding, what it comes down to is tightening supply and demand. While there have been short term gyrations due to the Covid closing some mining facilities, which lowered supply, which then made the spot price more expensive, the bigger picture of the uranium (as a commodity) supercycle has to do with electrification. The world's energy needs have already increased massively, and with EVs set to the be the standard car of choice as the 2020s progress, along with population growth, the increased need for electricity will need to be met somehow. While existing sources could work, Elon Musk noted in a recent interview that: 

&gt;“electricity demand will likely double over the next two decades as a result of the update of electric vehicles.”[\[3\]](https://urnmetf.com/posts/electric-vehicles-drive-demand-for-nuclear-uranium#_edn3)   This does not take into account increased demand that may result from other sources such as increased population, growing reliance on digital services, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Musk went on to note that sourcing the energy necessary to power EVs has the potential to become the biggest obstacle over the next two decades.  
&gt;  
&gt;To meet this demand, Musk added that “to do this, we have to increase the capacities of wind, solar, and nuclear power plants.”  However, given that the wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine, he noted that nuclear power might be necessary to meet tomorrow’s need for electricity.

There is also a carbon-free/clean power component to this (more on this below). In short, the world's energy needs will rocket, and to meet it, uranium might be the fuel. 

\- Con: 

The uranium spot price has declined for a couple months after jumping last year. Is this a downward trend or just a breather? Is it just hype that people are talking about uranium if the spot price (and long term price) are trending lower? You'll have to decide this part for yourself. A [chart is here](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price), from Cameco, a huge uranium miner in the US. 

\+ Pro:

Celebrity hype? Well I doubt we'll ever get Mia Khalifa, but, Bill Gates is no scrub either. See here for his [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/bill-gates-nuclear-power-will-absolutely-be-politically-acceptable.html) on CNBC recently. 

Michael Burry (The Big Short) will have to do for now too. Check out his [updated twitter cover pic](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en) as of a couple weeks ago. 

&gt;Nuclear power will ‘absolutely’ be politically acceptable again — it’s safer than oil, coal, natural gas - Bill Gates, 2021  

\+ Pro:

UUUU is also a major producer of [Vanadium](https://www.energyfuels.com/vanadium-production), important for EV batteries, aerospace, renewable energy systems. They've upgraded their vanadium producing capabilities, yada yada yada, etc, etc. The point is, this is another tailwind they're taking advantage of. 

\+ Pro:

The stock is cheap. It's testing $6. The options are cheap too, though I don't know anything about gamma squeezing and all that. To be clear though, I wouldn't be surprised to see some pullback from here either, so my buy targets are all the way through the low $5's. 

\+ Pro: 

Through a very rough February, UUUU mostly held its ground. The chart looks good. Wedge breakout. See here:

And, take a look at this [very interesting tweet](https://twitter.com/ziontree/status/1366013984307044356). This appears to be someone that was very much anti-nuclear a long time ago (sorry, I think it's pronounced ""nucular"". Et tu Bush? This is really 2006 all over isn't it) and is now pro-nuclear. I think this has some interesting implications. If the climate change crowd sees nuclear as a key part of reversing dangerous climate trends and creating a healthy planet, that would mark a huge shift. The Biden administration energy secretary has also expressed openness to nuclear. This has the potential to be bipartisan, and the only bipartisan thing I've seen recently was both AOC and Cruz trashing Robinhood for blocking everyone's trading. Wouldn't it be something if the thing that got nuclear power popular again, as it is carbon-free, was climate change? Something about strange bedfellows... 

For more DD, you can see the UUUU investor presentation [here](https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ircnw_energyfuels/721/2020-02%20Corp%20Presentation%20%28FINAL%29-Edit.pdf). With multiple tailwinds in uranium, vanadium, and rare earths, this is a long-term hold. For more community, you can see r/UraniumSqueeze.

Course of action: Transfer funds from RH to your bank and delete profile/app.

Suggested date: September 2nd, 2021 4pm Eastern Time, 1pm Pacific Time

I’ve seen everyone complaining about Robinhood, except for maybe newbies in the stock world, but everyone else here seem to detest RH. Those that are new and are asking themselves why is everyone hating on RH? The reason is for them stopping trades in their app as soon as they got a whiff of everyone buying GME. Now they are doing it regularly whenever they see a stock go high in a short amount of time. This proves that RH is in the pockets of hedge funds who are short selling. Basically putting handcuffs on you when using their app, making you lose a lot of money at times. Beside that they sell all your information you’ve provided, since technically they do not charge anything to use their app. 


The main point - look what we all common people did to GME by the power of unity. If everyone here really hates RH and want to show what united people can do, we should all boycott RH by transferring up to the last penny from your RH account to your bank and deleting your profile/app. This should be coordinated where every single reader in this thread transfers their money and deletes RH on the same day at the same time. Imaging what lesson will be learned from this. This will teach big companies, that common people like us, have a bigger voice and should be for us instead of against us. Most importantly, it will empower all the common folk and show the true power of unity. We the people, united, have the power to change the world and get rid all those rich greedy fucks that are pushing the middle class and lower class against each other. Enough is enough. 

Other options for trading - Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab. There are more but this are some of the most trusted.

So for each 10 of APHA I have I'll get 8 TLRY in exchange.  Now along as APHA stays under 80% of TLRY Then that's a great value. Especially as my value will increase. Example. 8 TLRY @ 28= 224.  10 APHA (8 TLRY) @ 16 or less = 160 or less. 
However I have been watching TLRY and it spikes and dips between 25-32/share. APHA recently has been holding around 18-20. As time gets closer to the merger do you think TLRY will decrease and APHA increase beyond the 20% margin for exchange value?  I believe that TLRY will increase once the merger completes but I want my value to have as much gain as possible. 
Any thoughts?","Tilray, Aphria merger question.",1.0,1614716869,thisperson316
