I'm a broke ass student who always dreamt big, but also made terrible choices constantly.
I jumped into this group along with the second rise of gme with a humble investment of 9 stocks with an avg of 120$.

I feel like finally I made my first good choice in a ĺong time, and getting back the drive that I lost due to my depression.

This post will probably get buried, but I want to send my thanks out there to live forever in the depths of the internet.

Thank you guys!! This community is seriously amazing!
