6,lx5o3z,"Okay hear me out this is more than a “squeeze play” and it’s essentially at its ATL (all time low) since IPO. $ROOT does auto insurance and their business model is pretty enticing. This is where you’ll all have to do your own DD as I have a sick kiddo tonight but want to get this out here to all of you. Let me throw some quick numbers at you.

1. Over 50% short
2. Closer to 52 week low (as mentioned above)
3. 42% held by insiders
4. 39% held by institutions
5. 25m float
6. 364m revenue
7. 1.1B cash on hand
8. ONLY 188m debt

Okay so I know charts and TA might be over your apes heads but go ahead and look at the 6m chart of $ROOT then pull up all time for $LMND and compare the charts. Specifically look at $LMND around Oct 29th and look where $ROOT is currently. $LMND was very comparable in shorts, etc. Though their cash on hand was much lower.


If you appreciate this post, get this out there for everyone. I don’t want this as a distraction from $GME and all your other current plays but.. this is just a beaten down company at it’s all time low with great short interest that has 1/3 of its market cap in cash on hand.",Next SHORT - $ROOT,0.52,1614809338,JKK201519

13,lx5p2j,"GameStop has been consolidating since last Friday (February 26) with over 600k in OTM call open interest. 

While being extremely annoyed of the consolation ruining my calls (I also hold shares), I thought to myself: Who is one of the largest market makers in the world? 

That’s right, Citadel Securities, and there is an extremely high probability that they are on the other end of these calls, hence the consolidation and IV crush over the past few days. 

With that said, I believe the MM’s (such as Citadel securities) are manipulating the stock to stay under these calls in order to receive their premium in full and also to avoid a gamma squeeze (call OI is much higher than put OI, so a gamma squeeze on the call side would carry much more risk to them).

That said, I would be very cautious buying $GME calls as it appears MM’s headed by Citadel are doing everything and anything they can to avoid such a gamma squeeze. 

In summary, I recommend staying away from calls and instead buying shares.",GME and Citadel - Why the consolidation?,0.8,1614809417,Clutch3131

84,lx5yjb,"***Edit:*** **Special thanks to the mods for their quick response time in this post's auto-deletion. We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing. Well, I do anyway.**

*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*

So I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**

Why? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.

Ryan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.

Steam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.

If they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.

A 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572/share.

I'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.

I'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.

Let's fucking go.

***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***. What's past alpha centuri?

**Edit 2:** Loving the discussion this is provoking. As much as I love the memes, it's good to bring up the signs that GME's future outlook makes them extremely undervalued even without the squeeze, but goddamn I am lookin forward to tendies either way 🚀.",GME's Future: Steamkiller,0.91,1614810182,Souperdev
