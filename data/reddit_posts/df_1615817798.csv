You know who they are: rockets, theaters, phones and others in the merry band of meme stocks everyone here shits on

# Portfolio Surface Attacks

Sounds like some fancy words huh? Well it's easy. The big picture is that price movements on the whole group of meme stocks might actually be the bigger catalyst for MOASS. Right now a huge squeeze campaign is being waged against Gee em Eee shorters, but that's not the only way to crush them. Most of these shorts are correlated with bear positions in the basket of meme stocks and so price movements there still hurt them good. However, some hedgies (mostly smaller ones) are only short in other meme stocks, and not in Gee em Eee! This means, if a meme stock rises enough and causes some smaller funds to liquidate, causing prices to rise again, it punishes the Gee Em Eee shorts who are still in and could potentially catalyze squeezes as these stocks are all very correlated (look at the Wednesday dip to see)! A squeeze in Gee em Eee basically means the memes are visiting the moon too. A huge plus is that smaller market cap/float for other meme stocks makes them more susceptible to momentum in comparison to sky high prices rn.

# Why does this matter?

If you're an average ape waiting to get in on the action and help hate on hedgies, chances are you feel it's too late or risky. These other meme stocks are typically cheaper, undervalued/close to historical prices, and wayyy lower on IV for the options game, which basically means they're lower barrier and lower downside plays with all of the same upside. For all you true autists, there's plenty of quality DD lying around on individual meme stocks to look into, which I encourage you to verify.

Analysts suggest that Norway may be the first European market for Nio. The company is quoted on the NYSE, and its stock price is currently at about $43. Nomura analysts predict that it will jump to over $80 within the next few months, if it continues to meet delivery targets.

2. Largest wholesale mortgage lender in America
3. They use and own their own proprietary software and system. They're the quickest at approving and closing loans in the market and hold this as a key major competitive differentiator over their competitors.
4. They benefit both B2C and B2B.
5. They've grown %545 this year alone with earnings forecasted to grow %4.83 per year. Market Cap: 16.58B.
6. They're also heavily undervalued. Currently going for around the $8 price range; The fair value analysis is between $19.34 - $40.00. Source: SimplyWallStreet. [Here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-uwmc/uwm-holdings).
7. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.
8. Short interest is very high. Over the last 2 weeks, the short interest volume % has been between 28% - 31%. The latest short interest information from general market analysis companies are dated as of 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock had a dividend payout on 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82 (The shorts must cover that as well), so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC.

9. Major market analyst rate $UWMC as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.
10. This is both a good short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to reach it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride. Plus, it has a dividend of %4.82, or $0.10 per share quarterly. I'm not a big fan of dividends, but I know a lot of investors are.

Hello everyone, this is my first DD post, I hope it isn't too shitty......

OK, so the company I am talking about, is Instacart.

What is Instacart? If you ever ordered groceries online in the US or Canada then you probably have heard of it or had your online grocery order fulfilled by this company somehow.

Instacart is America's largest online grocery retailer, with partnerships with major US and Canada retailers nationwide, along with some smaller scale regional grocery stores. Instacart has more than 500,000 ""Full Service Shoppers"", independent contractors whose job is to accept customer orders and fulfill them within the given timeframe.

Since the pandemic, Instacart's business has been booming. It recorded it's first net profit of $10M in April 2020 and it currently has a market value of $39B as of March 2021.

What is good about Instacart?

1. Instacart has partners like Walmart, Costco, Aldi, Target, Rite-Aid, Kroger, and many other big-name grocery stores, which allows it to get access to a huge customer base. It also has partnerships with some regional smaller grocery stores that mainly cater to certain groups of people, which can increase it's exposure.
2. Instacart is easy to use, and it's interface isn't that hard to understand. The most IMPORTANT thing is it's convenience. Just tap, and your groceries will be right at your doorstep right away(just an exaggeration)

What is bad about Instacart?

1. Like other gig companies, Instacart marks up the prices by at least 10% and charges service fees for all orders. This results in higher prices than in-store.
2. Shoppers are unhappy about the base pay they are given for certain orders. Since they get to see how much they are paid for if they complete an order, they may intentionally reject to do unfavorable orders, resulting in long wait times and unhappy customers, thus making customers reluctant to order on Instacart again.

What good and bad do I see on Instacart in my opinion ?

1. Instacart has seen it's business boom since the Covid-19 Pandemic began, and it will continue to prosper if people are forced to stay at home.
2. Instacart's base pay is terrible on certain orders, plus some customers(including the CEO) do not tip for unfavorable orders. This results in some customers having bad experiences on the platform which in turn makes them less likely to use Instacart again.
3. During the 2020 US election, Prop 22 in California has passed, which Instacart supported. Now Instacart can raise it's prices to ""provide benefits"" for it's shoppers, while increasing it's profit margins(since they do not need to provide employee benefits to shoppers as mentioned in Prop 22). But, because of this and other controversies(such as firing unionized workers
4. The online grocery business has boomed, and Instacart is finding new rivals, such as Shipt(A.K.A Target, since Target owns Shipt), which can potentially reduce Instacart's market share.
5. Some stores have been piloting curbside pickup programs, which may potentially affect Instacart's revenue.

In conclusion, I think Instacart is going to be a OK buy, as long as the pandemic is not over, but some people have been talking about shorting the stock if it ever IPOs.

72,m5lywo,"Hello Apes, Bulls, Bears and any other animals that congregate in this subreddit. Today I want to explain what an option spread is. We will be sticking with verticals spreads for simplicity and because they are the most common and in my opinion one of the best and safest strategies in the option toolkit arsenal. Understanding these spreads will not only help you to make more complicated strategies like iron butterflies or iron condors but it will also help you hedge your options bet and lose a limited amount of money compared to a huge loss depending how you construct the spread. I’m a huge fan of cash secured and naked puts but when volatility is poppin off the chain I like spreads. 

There are 4 types of vertical spreads. We will categorize them into credit and debit spreads. There are 2 types of credit spreads and 2 types of debit spreads for the smooth brains who can’t divide. Moving along, In finance, a credit spread is an option strategy that involves the purchase of one option and the sale of another option in the same class and expiration but different strike prices. It is designed to make a profit when the spreads between the two options narrows. With a credit spread you are receiving a credit much like selling to open a put or call. The difference is you are protecting your downside risk with the purchase of the option. Let me break it down for you. 

Credit Spread #1: Bear Call Spread (bearish) : This is where an investor sells a lower strike price call option and buys a higher strike call option. The point is to receive a credit premium and also protect yourself if that stock goes to the moon. Example: Stonk is trading at $50 and you sell a $55 call for 3/19 and receive $2.50 of premium. Now you Buy a $60 3/19 call for $0.50, now subtract your credit ($2.50) from your debit($0.50) so your max profit is $2x100=$200. Your max loss is the width of the spread which in this case is $5 but hold up you received $2 in credit so you now subtract the width of the spread from your credit received and boom $300 is the max loss and $200 is the max gain. Magic. Moving on to the next credit spread 

Bull Put Spread #2 (bullish) You will be selling a higher strike price put option and buying a lower strike put option to receive a credit but mitigate risk. Now the stock is at $80 and you sell a $75 strike 3/19 put and receive $2.50 you then buy the $70 put 3/19 for $0.50 so you are essentially receiving $2.00 in premium and since the width is $5 we are going subtract the $2 from $5 and we now have the max loss of $300 and max gain of $200. (Using name numbers for convenience) there is also a break even point somewhere between the spread that can be calculated in this case by short put - premium received. So $75-$2 credit = $73 break even point. 

Now moving on to debit spreads. Debit spreads are like buying options but the short options primary use is to help pay for the long options upfront cost. Debit spread #1 Bull Call Spread (bullish) Stock is at $50 and you buy a $50 call 3/19 for $4 you now sell a $60 call 3/19 for $1. So you’re cost is $3 and the width of the spread is $10. Profit/loss formula is different for debit spreads. Now we take the debit - the width of the spread which is $3-$10=$7. Your max gain is $700. Your max loss is simply what you paid for the spread, $300. 

Lastly the Bear Put Spread (bearish) stock is at $50 and you buy a $50 put 3/19 for $4 and sell a $60 put 3/19 for $1. Now like the example before you subtract the two and get a debit of $3 and the width of the spread is $10 so now subtract the debit with the width of the spread and you have $7 of profit and the max loss is the cost of the trade.

98,m5m31b,"OK Listen up you autists and smooth brain APEs. I'm a retard so you should do your own DD as well and let me know if this valuation make senses or point out that I have an extra chromosome.

$MICT is an underrated and probably undervalued company that I saw last night being mentioned for some reason  in a yahoo SOS ticker board I was looking at. So I decided to look a little further into the company because why late night shower thoughts and why the fuck not.

As you know $FUTU is a company that recently debuted at a overvalued company that was touted as game breaking a trading platform like robinhood and schwab but for mainland china and hong kong.

FUTU soared and early investors reaped the benefits at one point it was at $200. So here is the thing a recent article I read (link below)

[MICT Acquires Key License for Soon-to-Launch Stock Trading and Wealth Management Platform and Mobile App in China and Hong Kong Nasdaq:MICT (globenewswire.com)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/25/2182625/0/en/MICT-Acquires-Key-License-for-Soon-to-Launch-Stock-Trading-and-Wealth-Management-Platform-and-Mobile-App-in-China-and-Hong-Kong.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

What this article is saying is that there are over 400 million Chinese millennials and 325 million generation z. China makes up a huge portion of stock market trades. According to the article China and Hong Kong accounted for around 45% of total trading volume in 2017. Now that is a huge fuck you amount of volume going on and that is data from 2017. It is now 2021. That outdated data is probably under-represented at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. If anything estimate shows that robinhood has at least 16million users and with the robinhood company being valued at 20 billion pre-ipo. $FUTU has 1 million users and has a current valuation of 20b with a ridiculous PE something like 188+ ridiculous. What this means for you smooth brains is that if we follow that trend. $MICT should start following its peers or atleast rocket from $2 to anywhere from $20-$200 depending on how many new users open new accounts with them. The more that do the more the company would make. The article also references that there is a huge potential untapped market FUTU is barely scratching the surface 1 million user engagement at a whopping 20b valuation means if MICT becomes just as successful in the future it could reflect a similar share price.

&amp;#x200B;

MICT should be valued just as retardedly high. MICT has pretty much acquired a 9% stake in Huapei last year and was finally approved recently by the hong kong exchange to acquire said company. They plan to go live in 2-3weeks as of this article Feb 25, 2021. So pretty much sometime in March 2021. 

TL:DR  

 ""INSERT FUCK IT! IM IN""

Positions 1000shares at $2.11

Will buy FDs LEAPs if options ever becomes available for $MICT
