Important points from the conference today

* Differentiator Vaccine which has potential to work against other strains (tests on way)
* We are working with government agencies and we are hopeful we get a commitment and a contract.
* The govt will help us pick up distribution and supply for deploying the vaccine.
* We can also use our vaccine as booster for all of those who received other vaccines.
* We are in talks with FDA and they did comment on our interim data and they are happy with it.
* We will file for EUA as soon as we get more data published hopefully in beginning of April.
* 4 weeks after that we could receive EUA and start our supply of doses.
* USA release testing will happen via Ocugen control from a FDA approved laboratory -&gt; ongoing
* Covaxin will have its own clinical trials for children in US if needed.
* More good news on Ocugen  ocu400 Pipeline coming soon.
* More than 50 million in run way currently.

EUA filing in April is faster than NVAX which are getting ready to file in May

36,m16qki,"Imagine that you are a crinkley-brained whale with a monster stash and a burning focus on sucking up all the GME money.  You don't care whose money it is -- the hedgies, the apes, other whales.  You are intently aware that this thing started on WSB and you read it daily to know your enemy.  

You have observed that the fearless, rowdy apes have 90% of of the posture, but only 10% of the money.  You know intimately the fear &amp; greed of the hedgies and it is second nature to use that to feed on them.  You are sure that they are still short, but can't determine how short.  It is clear to you that there is a finite amount of money, because bankruptcy, and you sense that the action will end in late March.  

You don't care about legalities but want to avoid legal consequences.  You are aggressive, crafty, and emotionless (except when you win).  You secretly think of GME as ""Game Stonk"" -- other than that you are humorless. You are infinitely greedy.  You strive for invisibility. 

What are your strategies to extract the most money?  What moves do you make and when?

What are the ways that apes can sense your moves and feed on the scraps?

How can an ape tell from your actions when the moon has been reached and to stop hodling?

39,m16qmq,"I  watched the Jim Cramer interview again where he admits to some of the games he played when he owned a hedge fund and It got me thinking. He describes times he would take 5 to 12 million to manipulate a stock when he was short or long and needed a boost in his direction. He gives an example of IBM.

There is talk of Hedge Funds playing our side, the long game, knowing there is a lot of money on this side. That explains the volume we see at times. $GME got stopped the first time cause it was going supersonic to the moon. If this time it takes a slow pace to the moon like it's doing the last few days would the SEC/Government step in and shut it down? If HFs are playing this side, and Cramer used to drive up or down prices to start a trend, it seems like that tatic could be used here over a slow pace to ensure the price keeps climbing but at a slower pace not to trip any of the alarms. It would seem so questionable if it climbs slow, and the government steps in and says ""no more"" if done at such a slow pace.

I'm curious, cause i see some people (outside this forum) saying it will never hit 1K or 10K, but if there is HFs playing our side and the pace stays slow, seems inevitable to me.",Somebody may have spiked my banana but hear me out....,1.0,1615297702,ArthurKentAdams
