In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we‚Äôll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

[Ray Dalio‚Äôs Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it‚Äôs the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the ‚Äúrisk free rate‚Äù for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it‚Äôs the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it‚Äôs a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let‚Äôs go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded üìà price üìâ** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any ü¶ç with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)

There‚Äôs several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would‚Äôve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don‚Äôt need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won‚Äôt refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed‚Äôs official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It‚Äôs pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **üöÄ üåù**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **üìâ.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***üöÄ üåù***\*?\*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There‚Äôs this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really üìâ fast.‚Äã

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed‚Äôs worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn‚Äôt enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you‚Äôll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields üìà and all asset prices **üìâ**

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he‚Äôs changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn‚Äôt be counting on the Fed‚Äôs money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a üåàüêª in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven‚Äôt done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went üìà in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we‚Äôll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **üöÄ üåù** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we‚Äôll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)

[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we‚Äôve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade‚Äôs stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go üìà if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME üöÄ üåù when everything else üìâ**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I‚Äôll talk about this too. I‚Äôm sure some of y‚Äôall have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually üìà and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their ‚Äúnet exposure‚Äù, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn‚Äôt as risky because they are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they‚Äôve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It‚Äôs pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they‚Äôll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

73,m336nm,"First DD so go easy on me. First off lets go over the financials. Full 2021 FY numbers arent complete yet so I'll put the 2020 numbers. Note these numbers maybe a little inflated over current ones.

EPS: 1.363 ; PE: 18.35

BVPS: 11.18 ; PB: 2.237

What other company in this space trades at similar numbers. $FL does (18.45, 2.118). Thats a good sign, its trading like a company with twice the market cap. The difference being $ASO is regional and $FL (inter?)national. I see this as a bonus to the side of $ASO. It can focus more on the unique aspects of its customers and capitalize on *cough* guns *cough* those products. Contrarily, to the side of $FL, it does have a 1.4% dividend yield that is built into the price as well. 

Next question to ask is how well they have transitioned to the online economy that has dominated 2020 and will dominate in the non distant future? Introducing new board member Tom Nealon. Currently president of Southwest Airlines and previously served as EVP, CIO of JC Penney, (*record scratch* wait the JCPenney that got shat on by the pandemic? Oh no. . . lets keep reading.) from 2006 to 2010. *phew* dodged a bullet there. So it seems like he's actually good at his job and not a monke üêµ. With that being said it seems like they've already done better than your average brick and mortar during the pandemic, they have beat earnings in Q3 and I think they will again in Q4.

So now that we have reason to believe it's properly priced and there's room to grow from here lets get to the fun part. This stock is a time bomb, we hear it beeping but the LCD screen broke so we cant see the time left. Its 40% short and the shorts have been continuing to short as the price increases, hmm I've seen this one before. We will probably see 45-50% short on the next report date. 

There's no guaranty anything will squeeze. But at some point in the future the stock will be overpriced which means tendies and if it does squeeze, a lot of them. It will need a catalyst to squeeze but either way its a good investment

TLDR; üåàüêª bet against üî´ in Texas handing me my tendies for the next 5 years.

Ok I know everyone says ""Tomorrow this, tomorrow that, tomorrow moon, next week blah blah"" etc, and yeah it's probably more likely that nothing's gonna happen again tomorrow lmao. But here's why I still think it's going to be great for AMC:

***1) Industry trend:***

Cinemark: Earnings call 2/26/21 8AM ET (premarket), price dropped about 10% between 2/24/21 and EOD 2/26/21, increased 6.5% on 2/27/21, increased a little more for a few days. CNK did **not** beat EPS expectations (-$1.46 expected vs -$2.03 actual).

IMAX: Earnings call 3/3/21 4:30PM ET (AH), price dropped about 4.5% on 3/4/21, and increased 18.7% on 3/5/21. IMAX also did **not** beat EPS expectations (-$0.20 expected vs -$0.21 actual).

**AMC**: Earnings call 3/10/11 5PM ET (AH), price dropped about 6.5% from 3/9/21 to EOD 3/10/11 leading up to the earnings call (despite the intraday jump to \~$12s), 4.37% increase 3/11/11 which is mediocre or almost sideways I would say given AMC's current inherent volatility (I know this isn't the most fair and is a biased statement). **Then tomorrow? Maybe Monday?** Yeah again, sorry for sounding like all those other posts ""tomorrow this, tomorrow that"". But AMC **met** EPS expectations (-$3.15 expected vs -$3.15 actual); **did not fall behind expectations for the first time in many quarters.** Also, AMC **beat** revenue expectations by a quite large margin ($142.3 expectations vs $162.5m actual).

***2) Short interest per figures reported to and by FINRA:***

Yes the short interests data are reported after \~10 days and not fully reflective of today's ""reality"". But I think it is still relevant as the data's publicity is kept confidential/unavailable until the reporting date. And, check this out: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)

1/15/21 short data, reported around 1/27/21: $386 million. **What happened on 1/27/21?**

1/29/21 short data, reported around 2/9/21: $219 million (big decrease due to short positions having covered). Not much happened.

2/12/21 short data, reported around 2/24/21: $386 million. **$5.70 on 2/19/21, $9.09 on 2/24/21**

2/26/21 short data, reported around 3/9/21: $547 million. **$547 MILLION.** Are we going to the Moon or UrAnus?

We've seen some good increases recently, but looking at the prices I personally don't believe hedgies (or whatever institutions or whales or individuals who shorted) were able to (or intended to) cover much of $547 million since 2/26/21 (date of short data) up to now.

***3) Way too many good prospects (aka FORWARD GUIDANCE):***

Many people and YouTubers have already covered these so I will only list a few. All of you would know how bright the prospects are if you actually listened through the earnings call yesterday or/and are half interested in this company. CEO Adam was a FUCKING BOSS who sounded very much like he held the ownership and willingness to get AMC out of bunch of bullshit and get it going. Yes obviously he should sound like he's on the company's positive side but not all companies' earnings call give positive future guidance. When companies do present negative future guidance, that's when the stock fucking tanks

\- CEO has been in active talks with Gavin Newsom (CA governor) to reopen theaters in Los Angeles, the biggest movie market

\- Los Angeles highly likely to reopen theatres on 3/19/21, and if they don't, they will soon enough

\- PEOPLE LIKE MOVIES! As CEO Adam said himself, bears have been saying movie theatres are dead for YEARS but they aren't. Favorite spot for cheap ass mofos who want to go on a date while on a budget. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of movies, but the last thing I did before COVID shutdown was watching a movie on 3/22/20 or 3/23/20. It was literally the last day before countywide lockdown happened in Los Angeles. I also have not watched Tenet yet (huge fan of Christopher Nolan; watched Interstellar 55 times) just because I wanted to watch it in the movies

\- No one knows about the long term future and quite possibly the movie theatres may not stand strong years later, but for the upcoming short-term future, there **will** be an electric return and momentum which would further positively affect the stock. It does not matter if AMC was doing bad pre-COVID; the two situations are not comparable as many other variables have entered since. **We are trying to move forward from here on out, not just reverse back to pre-COVID era.** This ain't no finger snap shit. Stock prices don't really move rationally at all although all these analysts make their analysis sound very rational. Another reason to just ignore them sometimes. Not saying they are always on the wrong or something, obviously.

And as much as the points above may not have any positive effects, the share recount is tbh really not going to have much of an effect. Naked shorts are illegal and yes I understand that there have been precedents of naked shorts (notably GME, very much implied although cannot be 100% certain), but I don't think the practice of it is as prevalent as ppl make or conspire it out to be. It won't have much of an effect; just a personal opinion as with this entire post.

As for just the general shorting practice, A borrows AMC from B, sells it to C, and does **not** have a predetermined timeline to go purchase a stock to pay the stock back to A (i.e. covering/closing out their short position). B only has to close out their position if A explicitly wants it back or B is margin called. But A typically does not want it back quickly; i.e. short positions typically do not have a deadline to close. But until they are closed, B will be paying variable interest on them as you all know. If B does not cover, then the stock is legally owned by C, and **that's it. C has the right to participate in the shareholder meeting (in May) as of the share count date (today?) and that's it. A does not have the right or the ownership unless he buys another separate share. B does not and never had the shareholder's right.** Just wanted to reiterate this as quite a few people seemingly did not seem to understand this.

**TL;DR - BUY AMC shares, HOLD**, MAYBE BUY AMC call options too (I have good amounts of 3/19c $10, 3/19c $14). **But,** SELL any of those whenever you want obviously. Please don't forget you gotta make your own judgments on when you have to sell. No one here is going to help you or me, or be on your side (not talking about on your side mentally but talking about on your side *as a result*; result being your positive income. Doesn't matter if someone tried to be sincerely on your side. Only matters if you make money; let's be honest) as a when it comes to profit taking, the hardest thing to do. If someone sells, someone else is left a bagholder. If the price reaches $1k or $69,420, and if there are 1000 apes, not all 1000 apes are going to be able to sell at $1k or $69,420 altogether. It just can't happen. Again, some people seem to be putting themselves oblivious to this very basic idea.

This is my first DD. Be gentle. 

I‚Äôm all in on AMMO.Inc (a.k.a. ‚ÄúPOWW‚Äù)

Why?

We are still in a massive ammo shortage. They, like other ammo companies, have a huge backlog of orders to produce. And they‚Äôre producing full tilt. Also with our current political situation, guns/ammo may become even harder to obtain. 

Ammo.Inc is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. They design and manufacture products for a variety of aptitudes, including law enforcement, military, sport shooting and self-defense. The Company was founded in 2016 with a vision to change, innovate and invigorate the complacent munitions industry.

**Financial Summary for Fiscal Third Quarter 2021 vs. Fiscal Third Quarter 2020** 

¬∑ Sales for the quarter were $16.6 million ‚Äì 500**%** increase in comparison to the Fiscal 2020 quarter. 

¬∑ Sales for the nine months increased 282**%** to $38.3 million. 

¬∑ Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 20%, an increase of 163%. 

¬∑ Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 28**%** from the prior year. 

¬∑ Adjusted EBITDA has grown to $2.4 million for the quarter ‚Äì 295% increase from the prior year. 

AMMO is positioned for exceptional growth, setting a new standard in Fiscal 2021. Demand fundamentals in the US domestic ammunition market are exceedingly strong and we are seeing no indication of slowing. Our fiscal third quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in Company history, with even better quarters expected throughout fiscal 2022. 

AMMO‚Äôs sales for the quarter were $16.6 million, a 500**%** increase in comparison to the Fiscal 2020 quarter. Sales for the nine-month period (year-over-year) increased 282**%** to $38.3 million. 

Additionally, the Company experienced sales growth of 38**%** quarter-over-quarter, a $4.6 million increase. 

The Company‚Äôs margins have also increased to approximately 20% for our third fiscal quarter, an increase of 163% or $4.2 million year-over-year. When depreciation and amortization are added back to the cost of goods sold, our gross profit margin increases to 25% for the quarter. 

Now this was posted/reported during their Q3 earnings. Year over year saw a 500% increase, which was similar if not less than some of the other bigger names in the business. Then, in Q4, we heard this‚Ä¶

¬∑ Signed a Letter of Intent on February 9th **to acquire** GunBroker.com at an enterprise value of $240 million. 

¬∑ GunBroker.com is the world‚Äôs leading online marketplace for the legal sale of firearms, ammunition, and accessories with over 6.0 million registered users. 

¬∑ GunBroker.com‚Äôs estimated 2020 revenue is approximately $60 million, with over $40 million of EBITDA, positive net income and strong free cash flow. 

¬∑ The transaction is accretive to our shareholders. 

¬∑ Transaction provides strong free cashflow and high margin business. 

¬∑ This transaction further expands upon AMMO‚Äôs vertical integration strategy. 

The primary kicker here being the potential acquisition of Gunbroker. If they don‚Äôt find a shit show during their DD, assuming they‚Äôre currently doing their DD through February and March, it will add 60ishM in revenue (x3?) to what they‚Äôre currently generating.

They also closed out a repurchase of 1M in shares for $1.50 per share which lowered the overall float.

Now, the concerning part for me was available cash. They have 500k in cash, maybe? As of Mid-Feb. So my thinking is that they‚Äôll have to raise it through an offering?

Well that wasn‚Äôt the first piece of news to hit after the last earnings call. Which I sat through, and it was pretty damn boring aside from them all sounding pretty professional. Also their CFO looks like a serious dude.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y5gc0g7echm61.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7180688f653029b646abb8281ea69d13893cf82d

Also they have a board member who is mildly attractive. [https://ammoinc.com/about-ammo-inc/](https://ammoinc.com/about-ammo-inc/)

The next piece of news hit recently. It was all about Ammo entering an exclusive distribution deal with a Spanish company to sell biodegradable ammunition. Seems cool, but maybe sus because I would imagine shelf life would go down? Not that THAT is a concern right now given shelves are and will remain empty for the foreseeable future.

[https://ammoinc.com/2021/03/09/ammo-inc-enters-into-exclusive-u-s-distribution-agreement-with-bioammo-spain-to-sell-cutting-edge-patented-biodegradable-shotgun-shells/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/03/09/ammo-inc-enters-into-exclusive-u-s-distribution-agreement-with-bioammo-spain-to-sell-cutting-edge-patented-biodegradable-shotgun-shells/)

Then today, right before AH hits, we see a massive run up in price of like .45. Why? I don‚Äôt know? Maybe a quick pump so people could exit and rebuy? But why would they rebuy? Well, the public offering was announced.

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/11/2191778/0/en/AMMO-INC-ANNOUNCES-PROPOSED-PUBLIC-OFFERING-OF-COMMON-STOCK.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/11/2191778/0/en/AMMO-INC-ANNOUNCES-PROPOSED-PUBLIC-OFFERING-OF-COMMON-STOCK.html)

Go figure. Why didn‚Äôt I sell and wait for this? They had no cash. Now they will. The question I have, and maybe you can help me with understanding better is, how long will this take to equal cash in Ammo‚Äôs coffers so they can pay for gunbroker?

Anyways. This isn‚Äôt some DD post to try and suggest this company is heavily shorted, or will have a gamma squeeze, or w/e. BUT, I do think if and when the gunbroker deal goes through, we see a doubling or more of stock price. Which, as of tomorrow, may very well be $4-5.

95,m339ui,"**TLDR**: iStar owns $2.5B of SAFE shares, $3.1B in other assets yielding 8% (3.2B of debt which costs 4%), yet a *market cap of $1.3B*.  iStar should trade 2x from here, with a few possible catalysts that could get some attention.

# Summary

iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies. **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar‚Äôs SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017, which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings. There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman‚Äôs PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman‚Äôs SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar‚Äôs other underlying assets worth some $3B in other assets

# iStar‚Äôs Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets. These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# iStar‚Äôs Liabilities ($3.2B):

iStar is a REIT, so leverage is the name of the game. Debt, net of cash is $3.2B meaning if iStar disposed on their ""Other Assets"" they would be net neutral. The times iStar has offloaded assets, they received far more than what their book indicated [Link](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/istar-announces-the-completion-of-the-sale-of-its-preferred-freezer-net-lease-assets-300878208.html). iStar wouldn't do that as the cost of debt is \~4% while they are yielding some 8%. This debt is \~1.1x leveraged when including SAFE.  

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* **Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021**. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program or make a move private more seamless.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

There is a lot of information already out on iStar and SAFE. I'm a big believer in the SAFE and iStar business models, though my intention here is to highlight the massive price discrepancy between the two stocks.
