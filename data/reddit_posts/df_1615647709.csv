8,m47zhg,"Nah - that would be fun but its not the ending this story deserves. 

So thats why i would like to propose something.
Imagine us apes not only strong and rich together but also strong with all others apes and child apes and animals.

What do i mean? I really belive that who could make a dent in the whole universe and history of apekind when we do some good with all this nice and cheap money. 
So why not declare that besides getting fresh tats, buying our wifes boyfriends some cars and other cool stuff - we salso take that money and give it to someone in need. 
Lets say 5 or 10% or what ever amount feels good for you. 
But just imagine the wonderful message that we could send out to the world, if we would do some charity and give it to child wellfare, animal shelters or what ever charity you choose. Imagine the power we would have. Million apes giving millions of dollar to other apes. Just to show some rich fucks that people can actually do good things for so many other people.

Now that would be real gain porn. Showing pictures of all the money you gave to children without homes, mothers in need for medicine for their children, food for people that have nothing to eat, animal shelters and so many others lifeforms that need help from others. 


Come on apes. I know we can do it and also...you could never eat all those bananas alone. So share them! Be a good ape.


You see...that really would be a wonderful ending for the gme movie. 
After fighting hedgies, showing how stupid this whole short betting is and getting stupidly rich - the apes did not just celebrate. No, they gave some of that money to other apes to make them happy and bring more joy and happiness to the world.


Please think about it after the squeeze has been sqoozen....

This is not a financial advise. This a an advise for a wholesome heart and a better mankind.

Mods feel free to reflair this as another topic, but I feel this would be more of a discussion than DD because I may not have the full picture.. myself for the thesis

Anyways many of us are still looking at the tickers with strong trader activities.  However, we should still look at cyclical with solid fundamentals.

For instance $KMX and similar companies have been reporting decent car sales and these companies like many car dealerships make an insane amount of money on services, used car sales (retail or whole sale), however $KMX’s auto lending takes the cake.

“When I was a young lad in tendielandia...” I sold used cars part time at Carmax to pay for college.  Around this time of the year, it seems to be always the busiest times for sales.  What is crazy is that their auto loan interest rate is INSANE.  Like 30% interest for a 2009 Toyota Corolla...

What I am bringing is up are used cars sales.  Here are the favorable factors:

1. low interest rates
2. government buying shit debt from companies like credit acceptance
3. New cars aren’t really that enticing at the moment due to shortage
4. Stimmy passed
5. Tax refund.

When I was looking at the auto sector in general, it makes me wonder if the stocks are priced in already.

SO...

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**  
\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.   
[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)  
*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) *spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.*  
**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)  


# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

  
Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?  


**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**  
*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".*  
 *In a 2013 study*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***   
[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders**  
*The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social–emotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.* 

 **Social Media help autistic children navigate the world**  
 *Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***  
[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)  
**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**  
[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)  


If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate. 

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...  


# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...  
There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.   


**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes**  
*The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders**  
*Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**  
*“Participants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.*   
***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.”***

*The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy – even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* ***best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.***

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games! 

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development**  
*Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)  


**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**   
The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

  
Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.  


**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**  
*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'*  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**  
'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as “You’re a star” as opposed to “Well done.”'*

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won’t react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%. 

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands! 

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

See you on the moon with unlimited crayons and video games.

The IRS provides offers for software that you can use to file your taxes for free. What's the catch? Well, there's a couple. One, you have to go through the IRS website. Two, you have to be making around 70k or less (varies by software). Some of you retards are using the same software but paying because you aren't going through the IRS website. The link for the IRS offers is below.

[https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers)

&amp;#x200B;

**Best Software**

* TurboTax has one of the lowest AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) ceilings but if you make the cut I would recommend using them. Free federal and state. You can import all your statements directly. It's 2021, you don't have to type shit in.
* TaxSlayer - Has one of the highest AGI ceilings and provides free state filing (Not all states).
* TaxAct - Towards the top for AGI ceilings and provides free state filing (Not all states). Not as user-friendly as TurboTax but pretty damn good.
* There are others but these 3 are the ones that provide the most and are easy to use (This is important since most of you have smooth brains).

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT - You have to use the IRS link to receive the free offers. I made it easy for you, just use the link above.**

89,m48rdz,"I have been paying close attention to the ongoing situation with GME, AMC, etc over the past couple of weeks and something seems fishy to me. WAY too fishy. There is definitely a misinformation campaign going on while they attempt to spread out the bull run. My info on this post is loose but hopefully you get the idea. This is directed only at people trying to get into a squeeze.

1. Squeezes are supposed to be fairly rare events right?

So GME does the first squeeze in January. Now, ALL OF A SUDDEN, supposedly all of these other stocks are going to do it too (rkt, amc, sndl etc)??? Most of this being based on short interest rates and options coming through and other non fundamental data.

2. Retail trading is up across the market. Do you not think the HF's have spread out the game plan to encompass more of the market?

If they're being smart about this, the hedge funds surely are now trying to pump and dump other stocks as the GME saga continues. Every time someone buys into anything other than GME and AMC that is slowing the momentum of the squeeze. 

3. Volume appears to be super low on GME the past week or two. 

Tons of options trades are going through but no shares are being bought now. Meaning the money for those options OTM This week all went straight to them. 

4. WSB seems to be losing FOCUS on the mission at hand. 

This entire subreddit is getting flooded with shit posts and gain/loss porn. A week ago literally All I would come across were well written DD's and updates. I get this subreddit isn't just for GME, but goddamnit it is for making tendies, and that's why I'm writing this

5. We are transitioning to an overall BULL market. This appears to be giving people FOMO so they are focused on other possibilities.

Do you think they aren't considering all possibilities now??? They have fucking trillions on the line. If they think they can make the graph look like a fucking cup and Handle to trick the silly apes into buying more, and keep tricking people into thinking X stock will squeeze by Y date.

They aren't pulling any punches now and neither should we. We've seen how they're using the media as a scare tactic. We've seen them manipulating the graph. We've seen them basically lie to congress and the SEC. So why are we not standing together in solidarity on this?

WE NEED TO BAND TOGETHER. This subreddit is LITERALLY ITS OWN HEDGE FUND. We have so many smart people doing analysis for us. So many big players on our side, and then we go and do shit like buy some real estate stock instead??? Out of all of the stocks that are ""supposedly"" gonna squeeze, GME has the best chance of blowing the fuck up because it's already so pricey, the momentum is already there (huge short losses for HF) and it's basically the capstone of its market (storefront gaming industry).

So PLEASE, consider your future as a space ape this weekend. If we all DEDICATED ourselves to ONE CAUSE, the hedge funds will be swimming in their own shit by 9:30 am ET Monday.

There is no date for the squeeze. There is no guaranteed dollar amount. There are no guarantees whatsoever. But the Probability is there. And the more people we have focused on one cause, the better odds we have.
