15,m4ltcz,"Mr. Gill, 

Before anything else I will start by saying thank you.  Like many people I am skeptical of much of the DD I find on WSB but the time you put into making your posts and videos and thoroughly explaining your thoughts is greatly appreciated by me and I am certain many other members of WSB.  I know dedicating that much time offering your analysis was no small task.  You are the epitome of what makes this place so great.

A response is not required or expected, I just hope you see it and I'd ask that a mod could assist.  The first thing I'd like to mention is that I believe the nonsensical litigation being thrown your way is ridiculous.  I think others here probably feel the same, and perhaps you do too.  I have never invested a penny of my money into anybody's DD that I have not first verified myself and I'm sure many members here are the same.  We are all individuals making individual decisions and your contribution to any of those decisions, while thought provoking, did not induce my action and for an attorney to pretend it was (though I'm guessing even the attorneys don't see much merit in their actions) is shameful and opportunistic.

Second, and somewhat connected, I have found myself wondering at what point (if ever) you'd want to find other deep value strategies and if so a few things I ponder:

* Might you feel you'd be letting ""apes"" and ""r-tards"" and ""diamond handed MFers"" down if you diversified a little (assuming you haven't already)?
* Might you have been given legal advice not to reallocate risk due to your counsel suggesting it could have the appearance of corroborating the BS narrative that you orchestrated group action for personal gain?
* Might you feel inclined to refrain from sharing investment thoughts again in the future?

Speaking only for myself on these points I can honestly say I have zero doubts that this particular value investment will be one of many great ones that you come up with and I hope that at whatever point it feels right or prudent you will prove me right.  I can understand for reasons above why it might not happen immediately but I believe the entire community of value investors and high-risk gamblers alike will cheer you on when you elect to reallocate some capital if such time comes if it hasn't already.  I am assuming you won't be sharing much and I think that is fine.  Your contribution to this community for sharing your thoughts, not for allegedly signaling what a group of people should do as I have already made clear my position on that, has already secured your spot in the Hall of Fame.

So thank you again, friend.  Best of luck as you put up with the nonsense that came as a result of your generosity, and congratulations in advance for becoming the first member of WSB to gain entry into the *Tres Comas Club*.

44,m4m11u,"Hello apes, I threw some money into GME just like most of you. Nothing crazy but enough to make a difference. At first I was skeptical, when it dipped to $40 I was scared but I held strong. After it rose from $40 I kept holding. I saw posts about hedgies losing billions and saw some really great DD that made me feel confident, hell I saw a lot of really strong DD and technical analysis. None of that is the reason that I am holding. I’m holding because you stupid fucks have thrown a lot of money into these stocks and yeah a lot of you have taken profits, but you retards have been buying apes and donating to charities with those profits. That’s something these hedge funds would never even think of. These idiots are so self centered they probably don’t even know what a charity is (besides a tax write off), and the fact that everyone has been so quick to donate to charity or to redistribute their wealth makes this all worth it.

47,m4m1gr,"I have not been investing long, as a matter of fact, I didn’t trade stocks until GME had its first big rally back in January. I ended up buying into an over-hyped penny stock at a stupid high price, luckily after a few weeks, it dropped and I averaged down a lot. Shortly after, it went back up and I sold it all at a small loss to invest in GME so I could be here for the 2nd round. I was always disappointed I didn’t have the balls to go in on the first. My wife and I are now in for about 19 shares and just under 6k. We bought our shares about 20 minutes before the first trading halt last week. Within minutes my shares at $310 went down to $198 and I felt sick... but ended up buying $2k more because I KNEW this stock and community would bounce back and now we are steady at 260/270. It’s an honor to be part of this stupid ass community. I’m so glad my FOMO finally made me cave. Still down about $900 from my initial investment but I know that won’t last long. My wife and I are riding this ship with the rest of y’all for as long as possible. I can’t wait to see what the future holds.

59,m4m2w7,"Everyone knows over this past year COVID has financially, mentally and physically destroyed people. Myself and my family included. I lost 100k Sterling in shares at the start of lockdown and have only recently started making it back. (I didn’t sell btw). 

Over the last 12 months or so I’ve been lurking in this sub and mostly admiring people’s gains lol, or seeing what is gonna be the next big thing. I never invest off of the sub as I’m too scared to but I enjoy seeing others succeed. Even though a lot of you guys are going through hard times yourselves it makes me happy to see people working together for good causes. 

GME and other stocks that made a lot of people on this sub money, has allowed you guys to give back and it makes me happy to see that. From the guy buying switches to give to sick children, now to over 80 thousand dollars in donations to the gorilla charity. It truly wasn’t about the money, it was always about the message that wealth can send. Being able to help those who need it most and changing the view of older generations. The stereotype of the rich get richer and the poor get poorer was truly broken on this sub. But you guys did not keep your gains for yourselves, you gave back in people’s hours of need. 

I just want to thank everyone who has made contributions to this sub and have allowed others to succeed. The internet truly did unite, but not for your own gain. In the words of optimus prime, “the needs of the many over the needs of the few.” Fuck the hedge funds.

73,m4m5ds,"Hello Apes, Bulls, Bears and any other animals that congregate in this subreddit. Tonight I want to explain what an option spread is. We will be sticking with verticals spreads for simplicity and because they are the most common and in my opinion one of the best and safest strategies in the option toolkit arsenal. Understanding these spreads will not only help you to make more complicated strategies like iron butterflies or iron condors but it will also help you hedge your options bet and lose a limited amount of money compared to a huge loss depending how you construct the spread. I’m a huge fan of cash secured and naked puts but when volatility is poppin off the chain I like spreads. There are 4 types of vertical spreads. We will categorize them into credit and debit spreads. There are 2 types of credit spreads and 2 types of debit spreads for the smooth brains who can’t divide. Moving along, In finance, a credit spread is an option strategy that involves the purchase of one option and the sale of another option in the same class and expiration but different strike prices. It is designed to make a profit when the spreads between the two options narrows. With a credit spread you are receiving a credit much like selling to open a put or call. The difference is you are protecting your downside risk with the purchase of the option. Let me break it down for you. Credit Spread #1: Bear Call Spread (bearish) : This is where an investor sells a lower strike price call option and buys a higher strike call option. The point is to receive a credit premium and also protect yourself if that stock goes to the moon. Example: Stonk is trading at $50 and you sell a $55 call for 3/19 and receive $2.50 of premium. Now you Buy a $60 3/19 call for $0.50, now subtract your credit ($2.50) from your debit($0.50) so your max profit is $2x100=$200. Your max loss is the width of the spread which in this case is $5 but hold up you received $2 in credit so you now subtract the width of the spread from your credit received and boom $300 is the max loss and $200 is the max gain. Magic. Moving on to the next credit spread #2 Bull Put Spread (bullish) You will be selling a higher strike price put option and buying a lower strike put option to receive a credit but mitigate risk. Now the stock is at $80 and you sell a $75 strike 3/19 put and receive $2.50 you then buy the $70 put 3/19 for $0.50 so you are essentially receiving $2.00 in premium and since the width is $5 we are going subtract the $2 from $5 and we now have the max loss of $300 and max gain of $200. (Using name numbers for convenience) there is also a break even point somewhere between the spread that can be calculated in this case by short put - premium received. So $75-$2 credit = $73 break even point. Now moving on to debit spreads. Debit spreads are like buying options but the short options primary use is to help pay for the long options upfront cost. Debit spread #1 Bull Call Spread (bullish) Stock is at $50 and you buy a $50 call 3/19 for $4 you now sell a $60 call 3/19 for $1. So you’re cost is $3 and the width of the spread is $10. Profit/loss formula is different for debit spreads. Now we take the debit - the width of the spread which is $3-$10=$7. Your max gain is $700. Your max loss is simply what you paid for the spread, $300. Lastly the Bear Put Spread (bearish) stock is at $50 and you buy a $50 put 3/19 for $4 and sell a $60 put 3/19 for $1. Now like the example before you subtract the two and get a debit of $3 and the width of the spread is $10 so now subtract the debit with the width of the spread and you have $7 of profit and the max loss is the cost of the trade. Well that’s it’s for vertical credit spreads. See ya and happy trading!","I don’t teach high school, but let me explain option spreads to you.",1.0,1615690224,ThePracticalInvestor

92,m4mbjo,"Stimulus checks of $1400 are coming in. 

We are seeing this really heart felt movement of adopting apes, orangutans and gorillas. 

Now take a small portion of the population: say 10 million people, giving away $100 each

Small for each person, now multiply that: that is 1 billion $

1 billion not invested in GME, they could have forced a gamma squeeze that could force the actual short squeeze 

Why do you think this “feel good” campaign started right now? Why was it timed precisely to this week and not before? 

A smarter play is to use the money that was spent on the adoptions, to buy more GME. Secure the squeeze momentum first. After profits are made then adopt 10x more of the animals, with the earnings. Heck get the zoo you dream of, but get the money first

The biggest biggest amateur blunder is to assume your opponent is dumb. These HF’s employ some of the smartest people in the world. Right now there is a team of psyops who are giving ideas to the HFS how to drain money away
