43,m1hk32,"TLDR: Short calls as GME and AMC burn back into the atmosphere.

Yup you read that correctly. The most single retarded  play I have ever thought of, and I found it by accident.

Today trying to buy a single call at 9.5/March 19 I accidentally sold 2 calls I never had. Right at market open when the prices for calls for AMC going down. Took a minute to figure out my error and what happened. I was looking at my calls and they said they were negative, as in -2 calls. At which point I panicked and corrected my mistake and bought those 2 calls back and made a profit of $8-10

So what would happen if you sold a bunch of calls just at, and after the peak of GME or AMC. Well the money is credited to your account. Then you wait and hope your timing and judgement is correct and when the price is low enough buy back those calls. Yeah... keep thinking about that. 

So what would happen if you chose a date a few weeks after the squeeze and just waited to buy back. Theoretically you could make a %80-95 profit. 

The next question is what if you wait till the call just.... expires. Well then it is worth zero, how would you buy back zero? This is the question I have no idea if there are any rules or regulations for.

44,m1hk6h,"Hey Guys, 

I went full retard and thought to myself, hey GME plans to become Amazon of electronics right? So why don't we compare these two when it comes to market caps and their share values.

I might have went full autistic and I used Amazon's Market cap and online electronics' sales as values that are correlated.

MKT CAP: 1.54 T, 

Total Rev: 125.56 B

55.1% Of revenue is Electronics = 69.18 B

Amazon's share value is rounded to $3000, # of shares is 503,000,000

GME $250, # of shares 69,750,000

Assumptions:

GME will steal - 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of that business. This is ignoring all of the other things that either of the businesses have going on for them.

55.1% of 1.54T = $848.54B (Market cap value)

25% = $212.135B (Market cap value)

50% = $424.27B (Market cap value)

75% = $636.405B (Market cap value)

90% = $736.686B (Market cap value)

100% = $848.54B (Market cap value)

Add current GME's Market cap of 15.53 B to each.

Adjusted GME Share value when they steal amazon's % of electronic revenue with those Market Cap Values:

25% = $3,264.01 per share

50% = $6,305.38 per share

75% = $9,346.74 per share

90% = $11,171.56 per share

100% = $12,388.10 per share

SO WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SELL FOR LESS? THESE ARE NOT EVEN SQUEEZE VALUES. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS, A BIT RETARDED, AND HOLDING FOR MY LIFE.

With flowing locks of gold and eyes shaded to prevent my soul from being destroyed by gazing upon their magnificence, he shook the sky as he spoke in the tone of a disappointed Father, 'Gamestop will connect the world to the virtual marketplace for not just the tangible, BUT the Intangibles! Who else hires employees that actually care about the product they are selling and want to see you enjoy yourself with the coolest new games and classic oldies? And yet you do not buy this supremely attractively priced stock?"" 

Then, He showed me roads of diamonds filled with the Biggest, Fattest retards I have ever seen driving lambos, bringing back the 'High-Five' (to show off your DiamondHands), and a kitten that looked like Nick Naylor swimming in money. ""These are the fruits, and the bounty for those who listen to my words.""

And then, I was taken to an island floating in fields of fire and around me --- heads on stakes (including an ironically named Vlad), melting Bentleys, hedgies being deep fried into tendies. ""Here is the faith of those that seek to destroy American Companies to make billions. A sea of fire in the morning and acting out my favorite Harvey Weinstein Scenes with Harvey in the afternoons. The Meek Shall Inherit!""

Finally, as he vanished into the heavens on the Biggest Rocket that I have ever seen he called out, ""Do not forget, a man named Jonah and the fact that you live near a river, if you disregard my commands!""

After this, I bought $GME. 

""Weeks of pay into a dumb strip mall store!"" my family said as they laughed at me.  ""What a foolish, stupid thing to do! You are going to go broke."" my parents said. ""Please don't lose our money on wars the people can't win!"" said the wife. My friends said I was going crazy from being inside so much. ""Go Build an Ark next they said!""

But now. They have become quiet.  The great flood has begun!

61,m1hm3u,"Here is a load of non-advice horseshit from an idiot who knows nothing, but has been watching RBLX and just read an Investopedia Article on Direct Listings:

A lot of people seem concerned about where RBLX's opening price will be pinned.  This is the wrong question.  RBLX is doing a Direct Listing; all existing shares become tradeable by whomever holds them, subject to some restrictions.  Essentially, employees and VC's get their first chance to cash out.  

The price will therefore be dependent upon market forces rather than any particular price target set by an underwriter. Unlike an IPO, there is no underwriter here. It can't ""open"" until a bid-ask has been filled.  

RBLX's price action therefore depends on the incentives of insiders currently holding the stock tonight, on RBLX Eve.  More sophisticated VCs and investors might want to hold some if they see a heavy price target.  **VCs** might also want to do some profit taking - they've already made a ton on RBLX and would probably want to diversify.

**Employees** have been working around the clock for however many years (at least four, if they want to achieve total vesting of all their equity).  In my view, many would have no interest in holding RBLX for value - they would likely want to cash in their chips.  Their shares were literally worthless to them until RBLX went public, so in a way, $45 is as good as $100 - they hold thousands and thousands of shares, and are about to become very rich after working tons of hours.  Even if it dips, you might see more sales from employees who are like: ""EFFIT I GAVE MY LIFE TO THESE TINY LEGO SHITBAGS I MUST HAVE MY TENDIES"".  When your shares were essentially free, $35 is appealing, particularly if price is dropping.

A selloff shouldn't be unexpected.  Of course, aggressive meme-buying is also to be expected.  But which side holds more weight?

In my view, the profit-taking motive will be stronger at the beginning; eventually, retail memes will win out.  I am HEAVY bullish on RBLX longterm, and want to own as many shares as I can.  But in the first hour or two, expect wide bid-asks, low liquidity, and maybe even a decent dip.

I of course, expect nothing but 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 in the longterm.  But if you want to open your position in tendietown, it's good to think about entries.

77,m1hnq6," Many weeks ago, an Angel appeared before me.

With  flowing locks of gold and eyes shaded to prevent my soul from being  destroyed by gazing upon their magnificence, he shook the sky as he  spoke in the tone of a disappointed Father, 'Gamestop will connect the  world to the virtual marketplace for not just the tangible, BUT the  Intangibles! Who else hires employees that actually care about the  product they are selling and want to see you enjoy yourself with the  coolest new games and classic oldies? And yet you do not buy this  supremely attractively priced stock?""

Then,  He showed me roads of diamonds filled with the Biggest, Fattest retards  I have ever seen driving lambos, bringing back the 'High-Five' (to show  off your DiamondHands), and a kitten that looked like Nick Naylor  swimming in money. ""These are the fruits, and the bounty for those who  listen to my words.""

And then, I  was taken to an island floating in fields of fire and around me ---  heads on stakes (including an ironically named Vlad), melting Bentleys,  hedgies being deep fried into tendies. ""Here is the faith of those that  seek to destroy American Companies to make billions. A sea of fire in  the morning and acting out my favorite Harvey Weinstein Scenes with  Harvey in the afternoons. The Meek Shall Inherit!""

Finally,  as he vanished into the heavens on the Biggest Rocket that I have ever  seen he called out, ""Do not forget, a man named Jonah and the fact that  you live near a river, if you disregard my commands!""

After this, I bought $GME.

""Weeks  of pay into a dumb strip mall store!"" my family said as they laughed at  me.  ""What a foolish, stupid thing to do! You are going to go broke.""  my parents said. ""Please don't lose our money on wars the people can't  win!"" said the wife. My friends said I was going crazy from being inside  so much. ""Go Build an Ark next they said!""

But now. They have become quiet.  The great flood has begun!

All will attempt to climb onto the GME Ark, but will never be able to hold on with their PaperHands as $GME goes to $1000!

82,m1ho7k," So my friend just sent me a note about his next big bet, and I asked if I could share it with all of us Reddit Retards

&gt;Hey,  what's up retards? Big monkey here made fat tendies on GME, wishing he   didn't sell so soon. How many other apes feeling left out?  
I  for one have never heard of a Roblox, but my wife's boyfriend has been   telling me that it's super hot with the kids, blowing away all   expectations last year. With all the hype going on in the market right   now, you'd have to be a retard not to put your money into it.  
Putting   all of my $7,000 college kid retard bux in Roblox tomorrow at market   open. I am not a financial adviser. Plenty of open seats for you   beautiful apes on the RBLX pain train.

So  what are we thinking? I'm going to buy in at least a few shares. The  prediction is that the stock itself will start at about $45.

Here is a load of non-advice horseshit from an idiot who knows nothing, but has been watching RBLX and just read an Investopedia Article on Direct Listings:

A lot of people seem concerned about where RBLX's opening price will be pinned. This is the wrong question. RBLX is doing a Direct Listing; all existing shares become tradeable by whomever holds them, subject to some restrictions. Essentially, employees and VC's get their first chance to cash out.

The price will therefore be dependent upon market forces rather than any particular price target set by an underwriter. Unlike an IPO, there is no underwriter here. It can't ""open"" until a bid-ask has been filled.

RBLX's price action therefore depends on the incentives of insiders currently holding the stock tonight, on RBLX Eve. More sophisticated VCs and investors might want to hold some if they see a heavy price target. **VCs** might also want to do some profit taking - they've already made a ton on RBLX and would probably want to diversify.

**Employees** have been working around the clock for however many years (at least four, if they want to achieve total vesting of all their equity). In my view, many would have no interest in holding RBLX for value - they would likely want to cash in their chips. Their shares were literally worthless to them until RBLX went public, so in a way, $45 is as good as $100 - they hold thousands and thousands of shares, and are about to become very rich after working tons of hours. Even if it dips, you might see more sales from employees who are like: ""EFFIT I GAVE MY LIFE TO THESE TINY BLOCKPEOPLE SHITBAGS I MUST HAVE MY TENDIES"". When your shares were essentially free, $35 is appealing, particularly if price is dropping.

A selloff shouldn't be unexpected. Of course, aggressive meme-buying is also to be expected. But which side holds more weight?

In my view, the profit-taking motive will be stronger at the beginning; eventually, retail memes will win out. I am HEAVY bullish on RBLX longterm, and want to own as many shares as I can. But in the first hour or two, expect wide bid-asks, low liquidity, and maybe even a decent dip.

I of course, expect nothing but 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 in the longterm. But if you want to open your position in tendietown, it's good to think about entries.

**TL;DR:** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 LONGTERM but expect swings and lots of opportunities to build positions; but just in case, I'm going to use 25% of my RBLX fund immediately at open when everyone is skittish.

**TL;DR II**: 🌈🐻 in the early RBLX history, eventual 🚀. Cannot gauge when anything will happen, not advice, you have no idea whether i eat my own feces.",RBLX 🚀🚀 Direct Opening DD - Please Learn Why this is NOT an IPO Before You Make Any Moves,1.0,1615327710,POSOO_the_SMASHER
