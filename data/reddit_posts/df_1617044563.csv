I WAS TOLD ITS NOT A DD WITHOUT ROCKETSüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

ID LIKE TO PREFACE BY SAYING I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR NOR IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE YOUR OWN INVESTMENTS BASED ON THAT RESEARCH.

That being said here we go.

The DTCC has released new rules that essentially will split the bill with hedges and clearing houses etc. Now even the NSCC is trying to put out rules to split their bill too. The NSCC new rulings are set for 4/21. Time is running out for the companies to cover losses, THE DTCC, NSCC and more.

Why?

Mid March they found out the entire market is a fucking ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The US govt literally handed free money to hedges to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. That was the hedges job during the virus. Now on the 31st coming up that money is gone, no more, the rule is expiring and they won't be funded anymore. (Unless extended)

Who are they?

The DTCC is essentially the worlds largest bank give or take handling over 90% of all existing US money. They are the only people who receive ALL MARKET DATA meaning they don't have to guess about anything they have every bit of info they need on these hedges positions.

Why would they do this?

There's massive upside for many many stocks bc of the amount of free money pumped into hedges during the pandemic. This of course went to shorting an absolutely shit ton of stocks as we all know. Then the stimulus checks have essentially pumped more money into the hands of individuals then there has ever been before. This combined with the hedges free money disappearing the 31st can cause massive damage to the DTCC possibly for more than they are willing to depart with.

How do we know hedges are in danger?

Tiger LLC and Goldman Sachs have both been 'margin called' and liquidated over 10B dollars in assets for underlying hedges. This margin call on Goldman is ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGIN CALLS IN HISTORY. Tiger and Goldman both had high stakes in Chinese companies and US Media networks. For an example of what liquidation does to a stock refer yourself to VIACOM the price has drop over 50% in days due to liquidating positions. (Possible Distraction?)

What does it all mean?

IMO we've managed to scare the largest bank in the world, THE DTCC, they see their wellbeing at risk and are acting as fast as possible to split the bill with as many people as possible before shit really hits the fan and stocks like GME have INNNSAAAANE UPSIDE POTENTIAL come to be realized.

TLDR: THE DTCC IS FUCKING TERRIFIED OF US APES. The little guys are winning my friends. This can mean insane upside for GME among other stocks.",Hedges Are Fucked. GME GO BRRRR.,1.0,1617045098,OptionsBabi

44,mfxfuo,"This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.",National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging,1.0,1617046195,The_Greyscale

All signs point to Volkswagen changing the name of its stateside operation to ""Voltswagen of America,"" according to [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html). Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.

A Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source ""familiar with the company's plans"" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a ""public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility."" The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.

Traditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke ""the clean skies of a zero-emissions future."" The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.
