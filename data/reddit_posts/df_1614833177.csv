&gt;**A Consensus of Value**

&gt;Buyers are buying because they expect prices to rise. Sellers are selling because they expect prices to fall. Buyers and sellers are surrounded by crowds of undecided traders who put pressure on them because they may become buyers or sellers
themselves.

&gt;Buying by bulls pushes markets up, selling by bears pushes them down, and unde-
cided traders make everything happen faster by creating a sense of urgency among buyers and sellers.

&gt;An individual trader is free to wait for the best opportunities.

&gt;Most private traders fritter away this fantastic advantage by overtrading. An indi- vidual who wants to succeed against the giants must develop patience and eliminate greed. Remember, your goal is to trade well, not to trade often.


&gt;**The Market Crowd and You**

&gt;Markets are loosely organized crowds whose members bet that prices will rise or fall. Since each price represents crowd consensus at the moment of transaction, trad- ers are betting on the future opinion and mood of the crowd. The crowd keeps swinging from hope to fear and from indifference to optimism or pessimism. Most people don‚Äôt follow their own trading plans because they get swept up in the crowd‚Äôs feelings and actions.

&gt;As bulls and bears battle in the market, the value of your open positions soars or sinks, depending on the actions of total strangers.You can‚Äôt control the markets. You can only set your position size and decide whether and when to enter or exit your trades.

&gt;Most traders feel jittery entering a trade.Their judgment becomes clouded after they join the crowd. Caught up in crowd emotions, many traders deviate from their plans and lose money.

&gt;‚ÄúMen go mad in crowds, and they come back to their senses slowly and one by one.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWhoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character, or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.‚Äù

&gt;People change when they join crowds.They become more credulous and impul- sive, anxiously search for a leader, and react to emotions instead of using their intel- lect. An individual who becomes involved in a group becomes less capable of think- ing for himself.

&gt;Group members may catch a few trends, but they get killed when trends reverse. Successful traders are independent thinkers.

________________________________________________________

&gt;**Crowd Mentality**

&gt;When people join crowds, their thinking becomes primitive and they become more prone to act on impulse. Crowds swing from fear to glee, from panic to euphoria. A scientist can be cool and rational in his lab but make harebrained trades after being swept up in the mass hysteria of the market. A group can suck you in, whether you trade from a crowded brokerage office or a remote mountaintop.When you let others influence your trading decisions, your chance of success goes up in smoke.

&gt;Group loyalty was essential for a prehistoric hunter‚Äôs survival. Joining a union can help even an incompetent performer keep his job.The market is different: joining a group tends to hurt you.

&gt;Many traders are puzzled why markets reverse immediately after they dump their losing position.This happens because crowd members are gripped by the same fear‚Äî and everybody dumps at the same time. Once the selling fit has ended, the market has nowhere to go but up. Optimism returns to the marketplace, and the crowd forgets fear, grows greedy, and goes on a new buying binge.

&gt;The crowd is bigger and stronger than you. No matter how smart you are, you cannot argue with the crowd.You have only one choice‚Äîto join the crowd or to act independently.

&gt;Crowds are primitive, and your trading strategies should be simple.You don‚Äôt have to be a rocket scientist to design a winning trading method. If the trade goes against you‚Äîcut your losses and run. Never argue with the crowd‚Äîsimply use your judgment to decide when to join and when to leave.

&gt;Your human nature leads you to give up your independence under stress.When you put on a trade, you feel the desire to imitate others, overlooking objective signals.  This is why you need to write down and follow your trading system and money management rules. They represent your rational individual decisions, made before you entered a trade.

&gt;**Each price bar or candle reflects a battle between bulls and bears.When buyers feel strongly bullish, they buy more eagerly and push markets up.When sellers feel strongly bearish, they sell more actively and push markets down.Charts are a window into mass psychology.When you analyze charts, you analyze the behavior of trading masses. Technical indicators help make this analysis more objective.**

________________________________________________________

&gt;**Rallies and Declines**

&gt;Few traders are purely rational human beings.There is a great deal of emotion in the markets. Most participants act on the principle of ‚Äúmonkey see, monkey do.‚Äù The waves of fear and greed sweep up bulls and bears.

&gt;The sharpness of any rally depends on how traders feel. If buyers feel just a little stronger than sellers, the market rises slowly. When they feel much stronger than sellers, the market rises fast. It is the job of a technical analyst to find when buyers are strong and when they start running out of steam.

&gt;Short sellers feel trapped by rising markets, as their profits melt and turn into losses.When short sellers rush to cover, a rally can become parabolic. Fear is a much stronger emotion than greed.2 Rallies driven by short covering are especially sharp, although they do not last very long.

&gt;Markets fall because of fear among bulls and greed among bears. Normally bears prefer to sell short on rallies, but if they expect to make a lot of money on a decline, they don‚Äôt mind shorting on the way down. Fearful buyers agree to buy only below the market. As long as short sellers are willing to meet those demands and sell at a bid, the decline will continue.

&gt;As bulls‚Äô profits melt and turn into losses, they panic and sell at almost any price. They are so eager to get out that they hit the bids under the market. Markets can drop fast when hit by panic selling.

________________________________________________________

&gt;**Social Psychology**

&gt;Free will makes individual behavior hard to predict. Group behavior is more primi- tive and easier to track. When you analyze markets, you analyze group behavior.

&gt;You need to identify the direction in which groups are running and their changes of speed.

&gt;Groups suck us in and cloud our judgment.The problem for most analysts is that they get caught in the emotional pull of the groups they try to analyze.

&gt;The longer a rally continues, the more analysts get caught up in mass bullishness, ignore danger signs, and miss the eventual reversal.The longer a decline goes on, the more analysts get caught up in bearish gloom and ignore bullish signs.This is why it helps to have a written plan for analyzing markets.We have to decide in advance what indicators we will watch, how we will interpret them, and how we‚Äôll act.

&gt;Technical analysts believe that prices reflect everything known about the market, including fundamental factors. Each price represents the consensus of value of all market participants‚Äîlarge commercial interests and small speculators, fundamental researchers and technicians, insiders and gamblers.

&gt;Technical analysis is a study of mass psychology. It is partly a science and partly an art.Technicians use many scientific methods, including mathematical concepts of game theory, probabilities, and so on.They use computers to track indicators.

&gt;Technical analysis is also an art.  The bars or candles on our charts coalesce into patterns and formations.The movement of prices and indicators produces a sense of flow and rhythm, a feeling of tension and beauty that helps us sense what is happen- ing and how to trade.

&gt;Individual behavior is complex, diverse, and difficult to predict. Group behavior is primitive.Technicians study the behavior patterns of market crowds.They trade when they recognize patterns that preceded previous market moves.

________________________________________________________


&gt;**Read the Market, Manage Yourself**

&gt;A tremendous volume of information pours out of the markets during trading hours. Changing prices reflect the battles of bulls and bears.Your job is to analyze this information and bet on the dominant market group.

&gt;Use common sense in analyzing markets.  When some new development puzzles you, compare it to life outside the markets. For example, indicators may give you buy signals in two markets. Should you buy the one that declined a lot before the buy signal or the one that declined a little? Compare this to what happens to a man after a fall. If he falls down a few steps, he may dust himself off and run up again. But if he falls out of a second-story window, he‚Äôs not going to run anytime soon; he needs time to recover.  Prices seldom rally immediately hard after a bad decline.

&gt;Successful trading stands on three pillars.You need to analyze the balance of power between bulls and bears.You need to practice good money management.You need personal discipline to follow your trading plan and avoid getting high or depressed in the markets.

That Bold part‚Ä¶ remember now all those posts about people continuously asking why the AMC and GME, and other popular stock charts are completely matching up, and begging for an explanation?  That's the explanation.

_________________________________________________________

&gt;**The Meaning of a Bar Chart**

&gt;Chart patterns reflect the sum of buying and selling, greed and fear among investors and traders. Many charts in this book are daily, with each bar representing one trad- ing day, but the rules for understanding weekly, daily, or intraday charts are remark- ably similar.

&gt;Remember this key principle: ‚ÄúEach price is a momentary consensus of value of all market participants expressed in action.‚Äù Based on it, each price bar provides several important pieces of information about the tug-of-war between bulls and bears (Figure 17.1).

&gt;**The opening price of a daily bar tends to reflect the amateurs‚Äô opinion of value**. They read morning papers, find out what happened the day before, perhaps ask for a wife‚Äôs approval to buy or sell, and place their orders before driving to work. Ama- teurs are especially active early in the day and early in the week.

&gt;Traders who researched the relationship between opening and closing prices **found that opening prices most often occur near the high or the low of the daily bar. Buying or selling by amateurs early in the day creates an emotional extreme from which prices tend to recoil later in the day**.

&gt;**In bull markets, prices often make their low for the week on Monday or Tuesday, when amateurs take profits from the previous week, then rally to a new high on Thursday or Friday. In bear markets, the high for the week is often set on Monday or Tuesday, with a new low toward the end of the week.**

&gt;**The closing prices of daily and weekly bars tend to reflect the actions of profes- sional traders.They watch the markets throughout the day, respond to changes, and tend to dominate the last hour of trading. Many of them take profits at that time to avoid carrying trades overnight.**

This is my first DD attempt onto a reddit form, so my apologies if I suck!

If this is your first time hearing about the company, they are a Sporting goods retailer. They are similar to a Dicks sporting good, Bass Pro, Cabelas (Canada). They sell a wide variety of products that range from clothing to fitness equipment to outdoor equipment and accessories. They made a large chunk of their money on Fishing and Hunting goods.

Financial Health is solid for this company. They are profitable and making money. They do have some loans outstanding, but they have raised some capital to cover a great deal of them. Moving into spring sporting goods stores tend to have their sales go up. With covid no longer forcing them closed and with it stretching into summer, we are likely to see another rise in outdoor activities.

Today March 3nd we hit a 21 day upward average. This shows an upward momentum of the stock. In 2020 we saw a earning per share growth of **459.85%** which is awesome. The stock is doing well without any trends or lots of word of mouth.

2020 Q4 the Price to Book ratio at ASO was 2.2x.

ASO has a debt to total capital ratio of 59.18% which is par for industry average.

ASO did see a sales increase of 17.80% however this is number less than the industry average by a bit. They were forced to close due to covid, hopefully now that things are opening up it can grow that number to beat the average like it has in the past.

Then for all you short or nothing people, it is a shorted stock at 41.18% of the float. Keep in mind that industry owns a lot of the total float so that number works out to be a lot higher if you only look at retail.

Anyway no financial advice here, just wanted to share some knowledge. If you enjoy the stock maybe add it to your watch list and do some research of your own :D

Full disclaimer I did buy some shares today. I've been looking into the company for a while and I finally pulled the trigger.

While everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and RKT crashing ([I was crying too](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7mlz/rkt_12k_114k_17k/)) it was announced ZNGA acquired a game studio, [Echtra Games](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/03/zynga-acquires-diablo-co-creators-echtra-games-in-expansion-to-pc-and-consoles/), whose creator and his team played a pivital role in Diablo/Diablo II. They were acquired with the goal to help Zynga move into PC/cross-platform game play. I think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just [one of many planned for this year](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/).

The CEO of Zynga also spoke at a conference with Morgan Stanley today. Below are some excerpts he said during the call that I found interesting .

&amp;#x200B;

**Well known established global IP + data driven iteration + proven game mechanics =** üöÄ

&gt;We like to learn from what we've done before. And in the case of Harry Potter that was a big element of it. One of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience, so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience. So we combined a new IP with some proven mechanics that we'd been messing around with. And then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets. That's really the structural difference between mobile and console.  
&gt;  
&gt;In mobile, you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk. And so with Harry Potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was Australia or Canada, we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game. Does it retain? Does it engage? What's the conversion rates? Does the UA scale against what the cost of acquisition is? And so, we thoroughly put Harry Potter through its test marketing phases. And what we're really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal.  
&gt;  
&gt;We saw - the ratings were very strong. The Harry Potter fans were raving about it. It went really viral. We did some fun stuff with Zayn Malik. And it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch. But then when it started to hit weeks 14, 30 and beyond, all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements, we were exceeding them. So it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here.

The Harry Potter IP is a money machine. If you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions, or spend hours playing, combined with a raving fan base of an established global IP, imo this is going to print money for them.

The Harry Potter game was [launched on Sep/23](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-launches-harry-potter-puzzles-spells-worldwide). I think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game.

**2 Upcoming Game Releases in the First Half**

They're targeting 2 new game releases in the first half ""Puzzle Combat"" and ""FarmVille 3"".

**On Puzzle Combat**

&gt;So as we think about releasing Puzzle Combat in the first half, I wouldn't necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where it's - a Marvel movie that comes out at summer and it's got this huge spike. That's not at all the model here, right. We're in this for the long-term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're going to be releasing the game, see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what we're seeing in the dynamics and the metrics.

**On FarmVille**

&gt;And, there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people had played FarmVille over the years. And when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience, we‚Äôve doing a lot of testing. We‚Äôre also running a bunch of FarmVille games right now, whether it‚Äôs Country Escape or Tropic Escape, which has a very big fan base and they love the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;And so it‚Äôs a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the pre-set expectations, but what we‚Äôve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike LA. It has things that are familiar to people that have played FarmVille in the past, but it‚Äôs got a lot of unique new elements to it, and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days.

Puzzle Combat is more of a long play, and I like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays. Zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this, which I really like.

What I think Zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base. I think FV3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged.

**Expansion into cross-platform gaming**

As mentioned, they acquired Echtra to boost their expansion into cross-platform gaming. Unrelated to the acquisition, one of the first cross-platform titles later this year will be Star Wars Hunters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yeah. I think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall, some of the largest franchises in the world right now are cross-platform, and they‚Äôre free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like Fortnite, Pub G, Engine Impact, a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing. Well, I think that door swings both ways. I think mobile developers can actually step into the cross-platform mega franchise part of the market, because of a few reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the team they acquired:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think the last point I‚Äôd make on cross-platform is that. We‚Äôre just getting started in this. So the acquisition of Echtra is really a key one for us, because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership. And when you look at these guys, they‚Äôve worked on RPGs for up their whole careers. They‚Äôve worked on Diablo, they helped to create Torchlight, which is a fantastic IP and the action RPG category. They‚Äôve actually published games cross-platform. It‚Äôs a team less than 50 in San Francisco right near our shop.

I think if the launch of Star Wars Hunters goes well in the second half of the year then I think it's possible we see a nice upward movement on the price.

&amp;#x200B;

**Becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like Google/Apple**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...mid-point the last year, we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming. All of our games are enabled for IAP and IAA. But between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game, we had it was kind of opaque, right. We worked with other parties ‚Äì other third particles or use other third-parties like, Iron Source or Unity app and Google, Facebook, and the third-parties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition. And then we looked at our first party data asset, which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games.  
&gt;  
&gt;And that was tremendously valuable, but we were missing that piece of it. And so when we looked at it, we said, wait a second. If we do a couple of things here, we can capture the 15% to 30% we‚Äôre paying partners right now, just to manage the exchanges. We would get more information about what‚Äôs hot, and what‚Äôs not at the top of the funnel in terms of what‚Äôs appealing? What‚Äôs not appealing? What companies or products are doing better and why? We would be able to creatively optimize our products better. We ended in a post IDFA world that would all become first party data. The big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual, right? But if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are, you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint.  
&gt;  
&gt;And so when we looked at it from multiple directions, we're like, wow, we can margin expand, we can pick up more efficiency in our UA dollars and in our advertising business. We could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority, just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy.  
&gt;  
&gt;We felt like this was something that we could go after. We went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like. And we found that some of these components we could build, some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech, there's a lot of - there's really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as you've seen from recent development.  
&gt;  
&gt;So when we think about where we were as a company, we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company, but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and PCs, and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where we're seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers.""

This really sticks out to me. Zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by Apple/Google on stronger ad tracking privacy. They're becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games. This also gives them an advantage on learning what's working for others and apply that to their business model.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research.

Positions: $27k with various calls throughout the year. I think they could have a great ER to justify a new target price from analysts, so went with a higher strike price after their next ER.

What is it going to take to have people realize that continuing to invest with RH is basically condoning everything that they did to us. It‚Äôs like giving vlad your sister and mother after he got done with your wife. Even in Bulgaria people know it isn‚Äôt the way.
