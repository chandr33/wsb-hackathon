I worked for the company for a long-ass time, and even ten years ago they knew that they were going to have to completely change up their formula in order to stay alive. They've been talking about turning GameStop stores into the cultural hub of gaming for a literal decade. 

[Concept stores](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-24-gamestops-concept-stores-a-laboratory-not-a-hail-mary) using the new formula were launched, and they were wildly successful. They became social spaces for people to game, to try high end products, to gather with other gamers. And then, just when it looked like they'd tweaked their plan accordingly, covid shut down all social interaction for the entire planet. They were forced to limp along for another year with the other specialty retailers, fighting for life until this pandemic lifted.

And now, we're close to beating this thing. Vaccines are out, phase 1C is rolling out in most states. Cases are way down and will continue to drop. And you can bet your ass that as soon as it's safe, GameStop is going to launch this store formula in a big way...and it'll be spotlighted in a manner that it wasn't before thanks to all the stock price publicity.

My advice as a former store manager?

Don't bet against the bunny. That little bastard always makes it out alive.",You know what I think is most hilarious about all of the GME detractors?

68,m1mx54,"Basic math.  Halts are triggered when the price of a share rises or falls 10% in 5 minutes or less.  Lets assume that the squeeze is triggered tomorrow morning at opening (it won't be) and that it raises 10% instantly (it won't) until it reaches the high point (whatever that will be).  It would still take 75 minutes of constant instant 10% raises, halts, wait 5 minutes, trade resumes cycles to get to $1,000.  If you are of the mindset that it will get to $100,000, that is going to take over 5 hours or almost an entire trading day.  And this is assuming the price doesn't go down at all.  

[Assuming 10&amp;#37; instant raise and 5 minute halts](https://preview.redd.it/3z0z79kuz3m61.png?width=265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d499ef131767464da3cdbf81cf16b02fa3e5d8e)

My recommendation is to use an app like Yahoo Finance (free and easy to use) to set multiple notification alerts at various price points.  I have them every $100 up to $1,000 and then every $1,000 up to $10,000.  As they get triggered, I set an alert for the price if it goes back down so I can monitor it without looking at the chart all day.

This will not be an issue of I went to the bathroom and missed the squeeze.  This will take a long time.  This will be a slog.  It will be frustrating.  It will go up, it will go down, it will go sideways.  We only have one thing that we need to do once it starts...

 **💎🙌**
