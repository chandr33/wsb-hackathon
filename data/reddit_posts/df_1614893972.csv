I'm mostly holding meme stocks after the market tank thanks to the new PotUS

I found out that every Friday, the call options premium had been dropped near the market price (market price - strike price)
So, here's my strategy, I'm gonna buy some calls at or bellow the market price and then just exercise them right away (not that the premium are gonna skyrocket) and I won't get a margin call until Monday when I got my shares.
Meanwhile in the naked call writer's side, they need to fight to purchase more shares and since there's not too much to buy, this will push the price up.

Then the Monday comes, I received my shares fresh out of an oven with some margin calls (since I can't afford to buy the actual shares but just the calls), I can sell those additional shares to cover my margin.
Now I have no margin calls and with more shares to hold with the price higher than before the weekend.

So, what do you guys think, will this work? 
I know is a very risky move, but I'm very bullish after the short sellers had been trying to keep the price down.

Lastest earnings showed they were up 35% last year, slaughtered the expected numbers. They control the majority of the ammo market in the middle of an ammo shortage, they acquired multiple failing ammo producers right in the middle of this as well. 

I think they are significantly undervalued and here's why; In this ammo shortage, when they're already earning quite well they announced that 04/01/21 the price of their ammo will increase 3-15%. They're currently scaling up production to meet demand to tackle the mountain of about 1 billion dollars in backlog. Did I mention that the ammo hoarders are THE least rational consumers on the planet? If a senator so much as suggests gun control or expanding background checks they go out and clean off store shelves. With the all blue admin we have now I think those folks are going to be as retarded as ever.

Today being the Red Wedding day for everything in the market, (except for the champs in GME), VSTO dropped to $28. Now this significant because ZERO bad news came out of the company, in fact sales appear to be up higher lately too.

I reaaaaally like this stock and bought up a bunch more shares today on the dip with 18.46 @$30.27 average. For those following the sporting goods industry what do y'all think, is there something here?

I know there are many theories bouncing around on the meaning of Ryan Cohen‚Äôs tweet earlier today. 

Here‚Äôs a take:

RC Ventures currently holds a 12.9% stake in GME with clearance to purchase up to a 19.9% stake (see form 8-K for standstill provision timelines). He tweeted a still from Pets.com at 2:19pm EST, shortly after the tweet GME went fucking vertical. Right before the still the puppet said ‚ÄúpUrElY iN aN AdViSoRy RoLe‚Äù prompting a puke emoji out of Ryan.

Sure it could have been a whale going long, delta hedging, etc.. but.... what if RC started acquiring a larger stake in GME in the midst of a hostile takeover?!

RC tried urging the board to review its current leadership privately for some time to no avail. He then decided to take his message public.. not long after this GameStop‚Äôs CFO Jim Bell ‚Äúleft on good terms‚Äù while Chewy‚Äôs former CFO sat on GameStop‚Äôs board. ‚ÄúGood terms‚Äù my ape ass!

RC Venture‚Äôs statement after 13D/A filing 

The Reporting Persons have engaged, and intend to continue to engage, in discussions with the Issuer‚Äôs Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the Board and other corporate governance enhancements. While the Reporting Persons desire to come to an amicable resolution with the Issuer, the Reporting Persons will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.

GameStop‚Äôs board was increased from 10 to 13 with Ryan and co. joining with plans to have a vote to reduce the board back to 9 seats.


Start connecting the dots and I believe Ryan Cohen is taking the reigns.

83,lxwhpy,"As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. 

**TL;DR** the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.

**Here is what I did:** Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. 

**What is a gamma squeeze:** For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.

**Now that GME is @ $130:** Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. 

# GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)

**GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):** At this level going into Friday we could expect **22,427** in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About **2,242,700** to be exact or about **4.97%** of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. 

**GME @ $130:** We can expect **35,989** contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid **13,562** more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to **3,598,900** shares or **7.97%** of total float. Now we're getting nutty.

**What about GME @ $150:** Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be **46,397** contracts ITM. This means that a whopping **4,639,700** shares or **10.27%** of total float. **MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100**

**What does this mean?** Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, **10%** of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. 

Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. 

**Summary:** Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has **DOUBLED** I repeat **DOUBLED.** If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised **10%** of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still **50%** more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ill say it again for those in the back ***DOUBLED*****.**
