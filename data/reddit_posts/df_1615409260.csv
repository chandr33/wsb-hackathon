Lose money, panic and sell both at around a (realized) 400 loss. Watch the market roll on and decide meme stocks are not for me.

Cut to yesterday, March 9, and the beginning of the second squeeze. I am, again, thinking about jumping back in the game but I don't make the move until 4AM this morning when the markets open - G M E is rallying to the moon but I only have like $30 dollars available. I sell 2 shares of AMD (I aim to buy them back later, don't worry) to buy HALF of a share of game stop for the grand price of $170 ($GME = $340/share at today's high).

Buckle up and wait for the moon?.. Within half an hour of buying my $170 half-share and TRADING has been HALTED ... AGAIN!! Price of the stock crashed back down to under $200.

70,m287px,"**Disclaimer:** This is not investment advice, this is simply an inside look at the reasoning behind a large investment decision I am personally making.

MPLN is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market right now in my humble opinion, and I will attempt to explain why in this post. While major indices sit near all-time-highs this sucker is wallowing near all-time-lows at $6.30 after a merger with a deal price of $10.00 a share. 

**What is MultiPlan?**
MultiPlan helps provide cost savings in the healthcare industry primarily by utilizing their massive size and scale (they work with over 700 payer customers including all the big boys such as UnitedHealth, Cigna, Aetna, etc.) and proprietary IT tools to reduce the cost of out-of-network medical claims for all parties involved. This is a complicated business so I won’t waste time trying to explain it to people who don’t care, but all you need to know is that they saved their customers about $19B in 2020 on medical claims and charged only about $1B to do it (everyone wins – even the patients save $). At $6.30 a share the market cap is less than $4.3B and they have incredibly high cash flow margins on their revenue. They deliver tremendous value and because of their size, scale, and history they have an enormous moat around their massive troves of medical claim data (they processed in excess of $105B worth of claims in 2020 alone). They have long-term contracts and decades long relationships with key major customers. In fact, Warren Buffett actually considered buying MultiPlan in 2013. Instead, they eventually went on to make an $11B deal with Michael Klein in the fall of 2020.

**Why is it so low?**
Soon after the company’s business combination in October, MuddyWatersResearch put out an inflammatory short report titled “Multiplan: Private Equity Necrophilia Meets The Great 2020 Money Grab” and attempted to attack the stock. This short report has been thoroughly debunked by management (refer to the Q3 2020 earnings call for a detailed breakdown) and analysts alike (Citi called it a fundamentally sound company and initiated a $10 price target). The two analysts who have initiated coverage have given this $11 and $10 price targets and both occurred after the short report. Further, after the business combination they had a massive debt refinancing which required underwriters – nobody is going to allow them to refinance all that debt if there was any truth to MuddyWaters’ claims. In fact, in a recent fireside chat held on January 12th the business combination sponsor Michael Klein reiterated that the short report was BS and suggested that we will see the truth in the company’s future results.

**But who cares about MultiPlan?**
Institutions and insiders do. Insiders and other institutional holders (including the PIPE investors) own as much as 91.4% of the roughly 685m shares by my tracking. NASDAQ reporting data as of 12/31/20 shows 543.5M shares held by Institutions &amp; Insiders, however there are an additional 9M shares held in Treasury and some of the holders at 12/31/20 had to report their exact shares held in Q1 after tripping the 5% ownership threshold.
 
Further, somewhere in excess of 300m of these shares are locked up under the business combination terms, further tightening the float since the original owners (H&amp;F) as well as most of the PIPE investors and some other insiders can’t sell until later in 2021 and beyond. This has quietly been bleeding (with the help of shorts) and now is in full meltdown mode after a solid Q4 earnings report. Meanwhile, institutions load up off the backs of retail investors who were blindly chasing hype without a clue what this company does or what it’s worth. This not some stupid hype machine without real value; this is an established, dominant player in the subset of the healthcare industry in which they serve. PIPE investors loaded up $1.3B in convertible debt at $13 a share along with warrants that have $12.50 strike prices as part of the original business combination. Similarly, the sponsor Michael Klein’s incentives require this to get up around $12 or $13 a share. The very structure of this merger provides proof of the potential that credible investors see in it. 

**So how do I make money?**
By my estimation the float is as low as 50m – 85m shares, yet there is a short interest of 21.2m shares as of 2/26/21 (the most recent data). Based on my numbers that is anywhere from 25% - 45% of the float which is extremely high (and I believe it’s close to 45%). Once the worm finally turns, it will turn hard and this stock will run like crazy on the small float.",Multiplan (MPLN) DD - Massively undervalued; heavy insider ownership; short-squeeze potential,1.0,1615409651,TimmyTiggles
