33,lw9c8g,"Mariner Research dropped a bomb last night accusing Exro of overexaggerating their partnerships.  First off Mariner is a shorting company and their history of making correct statements is suspect and then if you look them up they have been found guilty of making false statements look up Blink another EV charging company.  So the source seems to be untrustworthy.  What's in it for them?   Unsure but after  looking at their past record and fines etc I bought more stock.  Bargain price for a company that shows huge growth.  Their coil driver gets rid of the gear box on EV cars, gets more power, battery life is better which results in fewer recharges and they make them for any vehicle.  They opened a new facility in Calgary in October which is their manufacturing location.  They do have an office in Vancouver where they started with electric bikes.  Yes they have had delays with the Mexican side but they are having this coil put in delivery vehicles in LA this July which when successful will put this stock through the roof.  It's a shame that Marine Research did not come up to Canada  to visit their facilities and the pics on their site look like they are from Google Earth.

74,lw9gbk,"Hello community,

I would like to bring to your attention another stock heavily shorted in the healthcare sector with 3 attractive technologies targeting oncology, haematology and virology (COVID-19). The name of the company is Moleculin Biotech and it trades under the ticker $MBRX. They have currently about 15 million shares float and a market capitalisation of $121 million. The next important catalyst is the data release of in-vivo activity of their compound WP1122 against Covid-19. About 6 more updates are to be released in the second half of this year on their compounds against Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, DIPG, Brain Cancer, Lung Metastasis and Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma. The company has done a seasonal equity offering at the beginning of the month raising about $70 million, an amount more than enough to finance the operations necessary for getting the drug against AML called Annamycin from clinical trials to consumers.

I consider the collective help of companies heavily shorted much beneficial if the joined forces support a company that fights for life extension than other companies which do not serve an existential need.
