21,m6hb65,"First off, Michael Burry has a huge position in this. I know a lot of you like to hate on the guy but let's be honest, he's a genius, and he's made too many right calls to be ignored. Let's remember that he had a huge position in Gamestop before it had a squeeze as well. 

As I dug deeper into this stock I found that it has a $1B market cap and it had $440M in cash flow for the year 2020. That means it's trading at a P/FCF multiple of just over 2..... this company will collect more cash in the next 3 years than it's entire current market cap which is insane. It also pays out a 12% dividend, which suggests it is extremely financially healthy. Currently it is trading at $8.10 a share which is not much above its 52 week low. As of today, it has short volume of 40%. That's VOLUME, not interest.

For example, If I buy a spac stock like SRAC, do I get the common stock of Momentus when the merger is completed? Do my shares just change ticker symbol? Or do I have to buy the momentus stock after and my spac stocks get sold at current market price. I have never invested in a spac and am curious how it works and if there are any other rules that I must know about regarding the spac merger process.

Also what may be your opinions on spac investment? What are some pros and cons?

59,m6hj9a,"Hello retards,

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a French retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other. In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng 🧻🙌). It also trigger stop loose (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE?

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data 🖍️ to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions.

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our 🌈🐻.

* ***🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸***

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people 💖) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge 🚀 tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win !

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose !

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet : “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.”

PL:TR: Price down cause of short sells and 🧻🙌 ----&gt; Solution = Buy now and hold 💎🙌 for going to 🚀🌑

96,m6hpro," TL;DR Thank you to the DD masters in this sub. Some random facts that we know, and HODL, but the dips. Not financial advice.

I want to send a special thank you to the Alpha Apes in the sub! You know who you are, and what you have done. You guys are the reason the 90% of the people come back here every day. I love reading all of your DD regardless of any predictions or non-confirmation bias, because I know what went into putting it all together.

We, the public, only have certain information available to us at any given time. The fact that you can extrapolate real theories and factual data from the publicly available cache is incredible. I will continue to read your valuable thoughts and form my own opinion, which will help me decide what I want to do with MY OWN MONEY (buy and hold obviously).

With all of that said, here is the reason for my post. We, the public, have precious few real facts to go on. The information we get from the institutions is old, incomplete, fraudulent or flat out non-existent. The only things that we know for sure are as follows:

1.) The hedgies have shorted GME.

2.) The total float of available shares vastly outnumbers the actual available shares.

3.) There are synthetic shares in circulation.

4.) There is a lot of artificial and negative press the further this goes on.

5.) There are a lot of Bots and/or Shills spreading FUD.

6.) DFV is a hero!

7.) The Alpha Apes who put their blood, sweat and tears into helping us, are heroes!

8.) Even though the hedgies did a very stupid thing, they have very intelligent people working for them. They have vast resources and many legal and illegal options at their disposal.

9.) We the retailers have Whales and other institutions on our side to a certain extent.

10.) Those whales and other institutions are not in this fight for the retailers, but are in this to make massive tendies for themselves.

11.) This is a big one. If a person was to buy GME shares, and then held said shares, he/she would indeed have diamond hands. This in turn would force a person in a short position to have trouble finding the needed shares to cover their position. Theoretically, the value of the unobtainable shares would then grow. As that value increased, it would start to take the shape of a massive rocket. If said diamond handed warrior were to continue holding his/hers unobtainable shares, the rocket would appear to lift off in the direction of the moon.

Lastly, I’m no expert, but if this theoretical diamond handed warrior did exist, he/she would surely tell you to HODL, and buy the dips.

This is not financial advice, blah blah blah....

98,m6hq5o,"I had a long ass post written but then I was like, these apes won’t read it. So the short version. We put in our money, they manipulate the market how they want. They make money. We lose money. They would have nothing without the people’s money. 9.5 million people in this group. What if we all took our money out for like a month after we get tendies! Do you think it would have a big enough impact to make any change? Sorry I’m a dumb ape and that thought has been in my little brain.
