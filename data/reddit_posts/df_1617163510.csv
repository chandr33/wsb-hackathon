Here are some thoughts that somehow, even if just for fun, can be realistic.

1. Show your love of the stock campaign.
Each person showing that they are holding shares of the company since january 2021 will receive a complementary discount on their first purchase.
- Maybe the more difficult to implement, because of the ""manual"" checking of the holdings.

2. Respect for DFV
Full, max VIP/premium edge whatever their fidelity program will be for DFV and his legacy
He could also be given a honorary board member seat at the table.
- Just a PR stunt, but as a nice touch

3. Respect for WSB Collection
Form an exclusive partnership with any bobble head manufacturer for a WSB Collection.
Items available : an Ape, DFV, Diamond Hands iconic mascotte, with also Cramer, Tenev, Plotkin and the prompter reader from Citadel, and a rocket.
- I don't see why not beside licenses and royalties needs from the concerned people.

4. A Meme world section
Offering any merchandise related to the meme universe, just for the sake of it. Becoming the best place around for finding props. Like mugs, mats, etc.

What other campaigns do you see to boost their first weeks ?

American Airlines will recover from this, the government had shown they believe Airlines are too big to fail in 2008. However people are hastily rushing to think its gonna bounce back to its peak before the crash. 

I've got news for you, it already did that and then some. Pay attention to the amount of shares available. You are  facing an uphill battle to get anything from this. Travel is still heavily restricted around the globe, fuel prices skyrocketing, limited capacity. This has nothing going for it other than retail being piss poor at math trading on feels.

Now comes my hypothetical question;

GME, We like the stock and we bought it and held and saw what that can do (wont go into much technicality of the short interest and squeeze and stuff). 
What happens if each of those diamond hands went to GME and bought a game or something? What happens to their earnings? That reflects to its stock?

42,mgyed5," The color coded lines represent moving averages at certain prices on the stonk over time. Using the 55 and the 25, I will show why I think that GME will be (possibly) spiking toward $300 again soon.

* The dots in first picture represent 55 day EMA at 182.
* The dots in the second picture represent the 25 day EMA at avg. 186.
* In the first pic. Everytime the dark red 55 EMA crossed to the bottom (from the top), it stayed on bottom for a significant period of time.
* Every time the 25 day yellow line crossed to the top (from the bottom), it stayed on top for a significant period of time.
* Those time periods at those crossovers for both EMAs were significant spikes in price.

My personal prediction. $225 level tomorrow. $250-$275 level Thursday. $300 level next week.

Eat bananas apes. 3 a day. Ape eat banana. Ape no cramp.

Bottom line: people want to escape their homes and they are going to be much more likely to document their out-of home-experiences, using GoPro and maybe even this recurring revenue bundle.

88,mgz55i,"Given that Amazon has built its empire on the back of its wage slaves, it makes absolutely no sense to keep bare minimum wages. However, currently there is no simple way to revolt against this company.

I want to provide a potential method for Amazon employees to take money from Jeff Bezos and put it into their pockets. This requires the cooperation of a fairly large amount of employees, but I think it is possible.

First, you buy massive amounts of puts of AMZN stock. Then you boycott the job, preventing cash flows for Amazon.

If a lot of people do this, then AMZN isn‚Äôt generating profits. Many deliveries will be stopped. The institutions will have no choice but to exit their AMZN positions. This drives the stock price down, thus increasing the profit of the put. Where is the profit coming from? It‚Äôs Jeff Bezos who lost a massive fortune.

Currently, I could think of some risks to this strategy:

If AMZN is able to quickly replace the workers with new labor, then it is unlikely to reduce the cash flow. This, this strategy works in a well-publicized movement, with large implicit cooperation between employees.

If AMZN replaces its entire delivery teams with drones and bots. Well, that‚Äôs in the future.

Just as hedge funds are the ones taking away the blood of America, Jeff Bezos is another one that should be targeted. Currently, there is a lot of controversy in insane wage hours and peeing in bottles, so it might be a prime time to spread a message to other slave workers and let them know about this plan.",Message to Amazon employees,1.0,1617169100,twistyshell
