Short week +Volatility holding = big move... Before I get into today's theme, let me go back and clear up something I said yesterday. Short Squeeze and gamma squeeze are very similar but not quite the same. As I explained, the short squeeze is when a lot of traders take one side of a trade (let's say short like the spy on¬†Friday¬†for example) and due to either time or lack of available shares on float, the trade goes the opposite direction causing a sharp jump in price because of short covering (which is the buying back to close positions). Team short covering with normal buy side activity and you have¬†an¬†influx of buying that causes the sharp price jump. On the other hand, a Gamma squeeze is when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock price. 

¬† Getting back to today's theme, we have a 4-day trading week. Yesterday internals seem to peak around 3pm and then turned over kind of setting the tone for today. Also, even thru the positive gains early in the day Volatility never really backed off. Market makers expected move is at 402.8 on the top side and 389.16. We also have a new month starting on Thursday. Just from these things Its possible to get a big drop today and then bounce back on Thursday to close the week. So, Let's look at the possible outcomes for today. 1) if we hold below resistance of 396area we look for the following dominos to fall break of 394 area opens up path to 390area. Then break of 390 area opens up path to 388 area and below. From the open you may have to be quick because it could happen fast and may only retest 395 area. 2) we hold support at the 390 area look for consolidation between the 391 area and the 396 area before break out higher or lower. 3) We break thru resistance area of 396 which opens a path to 400.¬† 

Either way buckle up because it seems to be a volatile 2 days ahead. 

1) if we hold below resistance of 396area we look for the following dominos to fall break of 394 area opens up path to 390area. Then break of 390 area opens up path to 388 area and below. From the open you may have to be quick because it could happen fast and may only retest 395 area. **50% probability**

2) we hold support at the 390 area look for consolidation between the 391 area and the 396 area before break out higher or lower. **10% probability**

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

So a few week ago zjz commented on the daily thread and said he was starting up a Rust server for WSB. He said he was going to be making a post about it to get some more players. It was up for a couple weeks and had a few players. Suddenly a few days ago, the server disappeared with no word from him and has now been gone for days. 

I‚Äôm going to take a jump here and say his base was raided and he rage quit and shut off the server. He‚Äôs also avoided replying about it. He was previously replying to comments discussing the server. 

So I wanted to make a post about it so we can all publicly shame zjz for quitting quietly and turning off the server in truly bitch made fashion. He might as well have been Robinhood turning off purchasing of GME because he‚Äôs losing.

42,mgg1r9,"You all know RH gets paid by orderflow from shitadel, right? That payment is depended on the width of the bid/ask spread. That in itself is a very contraversial way to make money and we have covered this many times over, its not my intention to go on this again.

So how do us small time retail traders/autists get our own back? Easy.

Step 1. Never cross the bid/ask spread. When you feel that urge to buy/sell, put on a limit order at just a little bit higher than bid/little bit less than offer. And take a note of bid/ask and midpoint. 

Step 2. Take a coffee, waste some time and check at it again. If your order is 1 lot, chances are RH has already filled it, if not improved the price a cent or 5. Wait some more. If someone else is higher than your bid, improve a bit more. 

Step 3. Improve as your see fit but very slowly. Do not go over the original midpoint by more than a few cents unless there has been significant movement in underlying stock. 

Thats it! Simple. This relaxed mode of trading gives you several advantages.

1. You save money.
2. You reduce the market bid/ask spread and save other traders money(in case they wanted the opposite trade), improve market liquidity and screw with RH all at the same time.
3. By not crossing the bid/ask you statistically measurably improve your odds of winning.",Nothing much happening so lets screw with RH for a bit of fun.,1.0,1617110946,davesmith001

I flipped through Cathie Wood's new Space ETF holdings and discovered some tickers I wasn't familiar with. Specifically, $KTOS. It's 6% of the Space ETF and 4% of the autonomous vehicle ETF so I decided to look into it. 

What do they do?

""Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc. operates as a government contractor of the U.S. Department of Defense. The company operates through two segments, Kratos Government Solutions and Unmanned Systems. The Kratos Government Solutions segment offers microwave electronic products, space, training and cybersecurity/ warfare, satellite communications, C5ISR/ modular systems, turbine technologies, and defense and rocket support services. The Unmanned Systems segment provides unmanned aerial systems, and unmanned ground and seaborne systems. It serves national security related agencies, the department of defense, intelligence agencies, and classified agencies, as well as international government agencies and domestic and international commercial customers.""

At only a $3 billion market cap, this company should see consistent appreciation as Cathie adds more to her Space ETF. In fact, 91% of the company's outstanding shares are held by institutions. 

Seems pretty attractive to me - Thought I'd share. If you have pertinent info about the stock, add it in the comments.
