0,m2167m,"Okej. Let's make easy calculation. Last Monday we get close to 45%+ and we had 35,000 calls. 

Monday 15.03 we have for now 45,000 calls. (lest calculate to that number, but remember that it should go bit higher) --&gt; 45,000 is 128% of 35,000. 

So 45 \* 128% is 57.

That means 15.03 we can see 57% + without retails hype!!

300 +57% is = $471. Without HYPE!

But 2021-03-22 Monday we have 62,779 calls for current price(lets calculate it to that price even if it should get 471) 62, 000 is 177% of 35,000.

So 45% \*177% is 79,5.

That means that 22.03 we can see 79,5%+ without retails hype!!

471+ 79,5% = $845 WITHOUT HYPE and retails buying in others days!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

And magic is just starting cuz $845 number from only calls, and it don't include retails buying. That mean we have to add to that number short squeeze !  


it's not financial advice. Ples do your own simple calcualtions.

When my grandmother was too tired to continue and pull the wagon she would let us all go inside to play the games and steal candy from the check out while she rested her good leg and tightened her prosthetic one. 

These are my memories of GameStop. This is why I love this company and I like the stock. I wish for one day this stock to be $6,969.69 because this was my grandmother’s favorite number. Cheers to all of the diamond miners in Bulgaria 🇧🇬

I joined the gme rally back about a month ago when it was at $300 a share and I invested everything I had (6k.) (yes, I know it wasn’t smart) I held for as long as I could and In the process lost my gf, my car and my room that I rent. I was laid off at the beginning of this COVID stuff and have still been unable to secure work. Especially now not having a car to drive it makes it that much more difficult. Anyways I held onto those shares until I had to sell the car and move out out of my home but it came to the point where I needed that money to find another place to stay and pay rent so I sold at a 60% loss. Few days before it started rising lol. I’ve still yet to secure work and I only have one gme share at 300 left. i want to sell it but I feel like it’s my only way out of this mess once it goes up. but same time I have no choice and rents coming up again. Anyways I guess what I’m saying is, If they’res anyone out there, I hope your listening, it would genuinely mean the world to me if someone could help. anything helps but my goal is 2000 and that would be plenty to get me by.

Or maybe do something really exotic with the funds, like buy shares.
