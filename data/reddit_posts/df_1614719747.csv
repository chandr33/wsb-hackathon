9,lwcrp7,"Remember all the shenanigans and manipulations hedge funds pulled out for GME? Those failed, just because the volume was too high for them to handle (like, entire wsb and elon, etc.) and diamond handed retards held onto their shares. Same might not happen to RKT. They can short enough shares for the frenzy to stop, alongside many other moves. I'd say collect your gains and get out. Maybe there is still some value (or even huge value) to squeeze out of RKT, but it still is very risky to hold onto it for extended periods of time.

12,lwcs10,"* It's a seesaw market day as all indices attempts to find a clear direction after one of the best bull day in almost 9 months. Alas, after running up 5%+ on Monday, Tim Apple pare gains while Andy Amazon stayed relatively flat until power hour where big tech took a big dump. AAPL closed the day down -2% to $125 while AMZN closed down -1.64%, losing $3,100 yet again. Similar situation with FB at -2.23% and MSFta t -1.30%. With pressure from big bois and all sectors, QQQ/SPY sell off continued into closing hours.

* **RKT** is back on WSB menu after a long hiatus where it never fucking breaks the $22/$23 channel. Things changed yesterday as the largest mortgage lender in the US reported stellar Q4 numbers, with EPS at $1.14 vs consensus of $0.87. For once theta gang does NOT win on RKT even with an implied move of 18%+. Coupled with the special dividend announcement of $1.11 per share, short sellers are being extra squeezed today as shares ran as high as $36+ during intraday high. Despite floating around up 18% to 20% for the day, RKT started sky rocketing as it broke out the channel at 12:47 PM. After touching intraday high of +60%, RKT continued volatite trade with multiple halts as all OTM weeklies goes deep ITM. RKT closed the day up 71% with the rocket continuing in AH. Surely a new round of WSBer going into an ""old"" meme stock won't result in a new group of bagholders!? 

* **GME** continues to trade in a new channel with wild swing days as gamma exposure settles from MMs selling Feb options last week. F to the bro that bought way too many $800c 2/26 FDs last week. During intraday high GME was up ""modestly"" at +8% to $133 but gains faded towards end of day to close red at -1.84% to $118. The all-to-important Q4 earnings loom later this month on Wednesday March 24. 

* **ZM** reported earnings yesterday and while shares soar 9% AH, the gains didn't translate in open session today as shares fade and sold off towards end of day to close -9% at $372. Q4 EPS was $1.22 vs $0.79 consensus, and they project Q1 EPS of ~$0.97 vs consensus of $0.72 along with full year 2022 of ~$3.65, above consensus of $2.96. Price target was raised to $420 from $390 at Morgan Stanley while Piper Sandler upgrades the video conference company from neutral to overweight, with a PT of $541 (lol wtf). 

* **ARK Invest ETFs** traded flat today reflecting many of Cathie's holdings performances as of late (until power dump hour). Sent by Market Jebus himself, Cathie Woods has been dealing with a number of negative news round as chatters floats about of funds targetting her holdings as an attempt to push ARKK, ARKW and others down thanks to recent growth name weakness and a push on redemption - to which Cathie responded in bewildment that her ETF has plenty of liquidity and redemption is never an issue. With selling pressure from ROKU and TSLA, ARKK closed down -2.48% to $133 while ARKW closed down -2.34% to $164.

* **Notable upgrades and downgrades:** BYND, an old WSB meme, stock received an upgrade by Citi from Neutral to Buy. Shares close the day down -5% to $139. Cruise stocks receive an upgrade from Macquarie today with NCLH, RCL, CCL all upgraded to Outperform from Neutral today. On the downgrade side, PLUG took a hit from Barclays from Equal Weight to Underweight, while upping their PT to $29 (up from $21). The meme stock tok a dump today to close -7% to $48.73.

* In WSB meme stock land (okay what isn't a meme stock these days), **AMC** close the day down -2.72% to $8.93. Steel gang (I know you're still out there) are finally slowly crawling back from the depths of theta hell, with **MT** up +3.71%, finally breaking out of $25 once again. **BB** closed down -3.76%, staying in the $10 ranges for now until the next catalyst arrives.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** SNOW and OKTA reports today after market close. On Thursday before market opens: PRPL, and Michaels. After market close: COST, SDC, AVGO, GPS, and WORK. Heavily shorted Chinese education ""platform"" GSX reports Friday before market opens. Watch for TAL and EDU to move in sync with whatever GSX ends up reporting. (Both are good ER play candidate if you don't want to deal with the IV crush from GSX).

* **Notable econ numbers:** ADP employment at 8:15 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM. Jobless claims report at the usual Thursday 8:30 AM followed by factory orders and EIA at 10:30 AM. Finally, Fri brings us the employment situation with nonfarm payroll numbers at 8:30 AM Friday.

* The DOW closed down -0.46% or +144 pts, Nasdaq down -1.69% or -230 pts, SPX udown -0.81% or -31 pts, and RUT close down -1.93% or -43 pts. Our boi VIX is back in the spotlight again as its up 3.3% to 24+.

35,lwcu33,"For those of you who do not know what Margin is, let's just simplify it to ""borrowed money."" When you open an investment account with any broker, they give you the option to trade on margin. The amount of Margin they give you is based on your assets versus their calculated risk.

There are 2 key reasons trading GME (or any stock you like) on Margin are dangerous if your goal is to score some gains off of a potential squeeze:

1) Shares bought on Margin can be borrowed and shorted. Not just those shorting at the $5-20 level when this began, but also those being shorted right now at $130. Shares bought with Cash (your money) cannot be shorted if you make your account a cash account. This can effectively reduce the Float.

2) Shares bought on margin can be called in. We saw this happen with RH and other Brokers in January. The borrowed money was not worth the risk of loss for these firms, so they executed the right to call in your borrowed assets to cover their exposed risk.

TL;DR - If you're goal is to reduce the float available to shorts, DO NOT trade on Margin. Make your account a ""Cash"" account and trade with your own available cash to prevent your shares from being borrowed.
