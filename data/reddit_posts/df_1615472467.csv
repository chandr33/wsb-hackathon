2. Download the GameStop app and take a look
3. Make sure you are not using margin on your account (I know most brokers have a 100% margin requirement for GME but if you are using margin for other positions then they in theory have the right to lend out your shares)
4. For any electronics that you may need or want, go look at GameStop first.
5. Think about buying gifts for family members or loved ones from GameStop
