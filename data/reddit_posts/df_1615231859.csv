So what would happen if this sub, millions of people strong, flocked to $DIT the same way they flock to meme stocks? In other words, what would happen to $DIT, a low float and super small cap company, if it were met by the volume it sees in a few months within the span of a few days?

46,m0o3f3,"I recently did some calculations and came up with a direct PTOF system that incorporates a HFT machine inside of it and swaps stocks between every index on the NYSE, finding the lowest bid and the highest ask, netting you an inconceivable profit. What the system does is like a Payment to order flow machine that  routes through multiple exchanges simultaneously. There was a kid on CNBC who was running a ponzi scheme that claimed to be similar to this, but is SO inferior to this system. I tested the possible returns from a stock called $EH, and the result was a 778,513% gain. If that's not amazing, I don't know what is. This is a HFT system, though, which means that it executes trades every millisecond/second. Imagine a nearly 800,000% gain per second. 

For this to work, though, You need to have full permission from these indexes (get ready):

Just wanted to confirm if everyone else also noticing the same patterns with GME (I do huff glue). 

\- On market opening, prices usually jump high, then fall drastically within the first 30 minutes. 

\- Day-long peaks tend to occur around 11:30 - 12:30 p.m EST

\- Last hour of the market we usually see a steady price decreases compared to the rest of the day.

\- Stock closes out the day a couple percentage points above opening

OK, let it rise again. Why on earth would I wanna do that?
Think about it. Over a good few weeks let it rise steady up to near the 300 mark where all those people bought in last time, and have been waiting for rescue. Bit of trading to give a bit of fight back and fore.
Everyone thinking, ""Oh here it is...rocketlaunch time, we are fighting them, and winning. Look at them trying to fight this, they are losing... Got this in the bag!""
Its the first time people have seen a profit ever.
It floats sideways a bit.... ready for launch.

Now tank it to high heaven, all guns blazing in about a week so everyone is suddenly scared its all over. I mean the biggest attack ever. People are now thinking ""well I managed to finally break even, if I don't do anything now I'll lose it all""- and everyone starts selling in the droves not wanting to be left holding the crash. 
Panic. I thought we were winning? It must be over!
300, 250, 200....
""I'm lucky, It'll never get that high again. Phew! I got out before it was too late, I got stuck up there last time, this time its def not gonna get back here"" It escalates, more people sell...drives it back down to minimum prices and THEN try exit after that without the resistance, aside from maybe a stubborn few apes who forgot what the sell button is.

Just a thought.

67,m0o79v,"First I want to point out something that should be obvious, but by reading comments here it doesn't appear to be that obvious to many:

1. HF's who lost billions of $$ on $GME...they're not going to attempt to make those losses back on a SINGLE STOCK. Institutions don't get emotionally attached to a single stock. 

Now that we have that out of the way, on to the DD:

# Why does $GME have these massive price swings intraday, then crash?

**Answer: Because institutions are pushing the price up, selling at the top, and making millions....here is how they do it.**

1. Buy ITM calls on $GME
   1. *This will appear as a ""large print"" on a number of dif. sites where people literally stare at large volume option buys all day. Typically when a huge buy comes in the options market it's an institution. It would be rare for a retail buyer to be doing 2 million dollar option buys. Often when this happens those apps / discord live chat / reddit have people saying hey look at this massive print, someone must know something.*
2. Buy OTM calls on $GME
   1. *Institution will then buy deep OTM calls. This also would show up as unusual options activity, and just create a confirmation bias based on the first ITM call that got printed.*
3. Buy $GME shares
   1. *Enough to get the price rolling upwards...causing momentum. When you have a stock like $GME that has eyes on it every second of the day during trading hours people notice very quickly when it's on the move. You have a collective mindset that this stock can go to $800 / share, $1,000 / share $10,000 / share ....or $420,000.69 / share. So when the price gets rolling people FOMO buy.*

**This is how an institution can get the price of something moving in the direction they want. Now how do they capitalize on it?**

1. Selling those ITM call options at a massive profit
2. Selling those OTM calls at a massive profit
3. Selling the shares, again, for a massive profit....

However, Institutions are smart, they're not going to dump everything all at once. This is why you'll get these double peaks in the recent trading days. If they sold off everything at once it would almost certainly trip the circuit breakers, that has not happened in a while. 

**If an institution today had bought a reasonable portion of $GME at $160, and started to sell at $200...they'd make over $4mm dollars. That + the options (and potentially buying puts when it was at $200) it would be easy to clear $20-$100mm a day on $GME with a fairly small amount of capital in terms of institutional money.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Again...an institution isn't trying to clear $20 billion on a single trade....you think the SEC isn't going to investigate that? But a $4mm gain... a $20mm gain? even a $100mm gain in a single day? That's nothing, happens all the time and would present zero reason for the SEC to even consider something happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

We saw this on Monday last week:

What do every single one of those charts have in common? **The stock never closes the day HIGHER than the high of the day.**   


If I look at unusual options activity for today on $GME I highly doubt that a retail buyer is making a $1.4mm or $1.3mm buy on $GME. 

https://preview.redd.it/rjaf87dbxul61.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fde04e830686de45ce90395fa8817bb314ed32c

If we look at February -&gt; March of this year it's obvious that institutional money is going into $GME.

https://preview.redd.it/7i7n6q3oxul61.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ea93ac64c0ab93de2b96f714c129fdc135ba3f1

but again...before you doubters come out...there is not an institution in the world who's going to dump $100mm into $GME in an attempt to make $1bn + off a single day / trade. No institution is that stupid, or going to do something that is a giant red flag for the SEC to come look at your books.
