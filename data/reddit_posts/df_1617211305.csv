37,mhbbb9,"So, I was pissed yesterday. Then I read between the lines and other boards and I believe they would have outperformed the revenue line if not for the patent sale upcoming.

Chen said that yearly income on patents is 250 M$. 250/4= 62.5 M$. Now, look at the deferred revenue line you apes between q4 and q3. It went up 61 million.

This is not counted in this quarter's revenue because if they sell the patents this revenue will probably go to the buyer and BB will get what they sell it for.

Clearly, people want it to go down but without this patent sale, they would be in line if not outperform the revenue expectation of 246 M$.  


**So what about IVY**? 

The timeframe for the IVY release day is coming sooner than expected! We can expect it in February 2022 which is insane, I was thinking we’d have to wait many more years to see that released. Yes, you read that right, February 2022!!

The thing is, so many people still don’t know Ivy exists and once we start seeing live demos of Ivy in action I expect new investors to flood in and the price to go up significantly. Nothing like Ivy exists on the market today and there are endless opportunities with this technology.

In the meantime, now that the quiet period is over I’m expecting a flood of new releases from BB and I’m super excited. Another catalyst will be drones, hoping to hear more on that sometime this year.

# TLDR; $ROOT has a rare short squeeze opportunity with a short interest of 47.36%!!

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website). 

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a “four-year head start”** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.  

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers. 

# Big boys invested in ROOT

 Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

 Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT’s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT’s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55. 

 (important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

 Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

The original bear argument was centered around $ROOT’s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company’s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT’s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages. 

# Root 2021 Growth

 Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:** 

 “We were able to show strong growth despite the decisionto pull back onmarketing spend towards the end of the first quarterresulting from the globalpandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatoryuncertainty.”

“We plan to more than double our sales and marketinginvestments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investmentin marketing fuels anaccelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.” 

 This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie). 

 **Daily Downloads – ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)** 

[ Downloads – ROOT \(Green\) vs. LMND \(Blue\) ](https://preview.redd.it/skmav0hlceq61.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95694e1c1dc782ca7c5db2ef4aaebdd41a016d5)

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target 

 Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology and an ESG trend that is too strong to ignore.

 ""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

96,mhbvb7,"Monday's earnings call was Canoo's single largest event since it deSPACed ($HCAC =&gt; $GOEV). For those who don't know me, I've written the original [Canoo/BangBus DD last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzioed/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/) which speculated the Apple partnership ([which turned out to be true](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)), I'm a mod on r/canoo, I'm active in most Canoo channels (Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, Discord and etc) and I love to share whatever I stumble across (like [leaking the Canoo pickup truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/)). This is not financial advice, I am not employed by Canoo nor represent them in any way and I do have a position in Canoo (see below).

I'll start off with this number: **$8.9m**. This is how much Tony Aquila (Canoo's Chairman) personally lost between Monday's close and Tuesday's close. While we've all lost in the past day (I personally lost six-figures), Tony has lost more than any of us. While I'm not apologizing for him, I'm sure he too feels the fire of deep red in his investment. However, much of what Tony said, absolutely needed to be said. The moves he made has set up Canoo for long term success and I'll explain why.

I was looking forward to the Contract Engineering revenue and became disappointed when we did not see it. I truly believed this additional revenue stream would've been huge in the short term price movement. After all, OEMs are reaching out to Canoo for their expertise, while other companies are rolling trucks down hills or [trying to build vehicles that don't erupt in flames](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39788/lordstown-motors-endurance-prototype-caught-fire-ten-minutes-into-first-test-drive). Having listened to Tony's reasoning and looking at [Canoo's financials](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/52/canoo-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results), I completely understand why he nixed the Contract Engineering.

Let's go back to the end of 2019. Canoo was a young company. Developing electric vehicles is very capital intensive. Canoo's liabilities exceeded their assets, and at the end of 2019 they had a mere $31m in cash with $11m in current liabilities. While Canoo developed a great product, and held some cash, it may have not been enough to continue to gamma stages let alone enough capital to build vehicles for their subscription model. On the heels of Stefan Krause being ousted, Canoo was in turmoil. Senior members saw the writing on the wall, and started to leave in 2019 to early 2020. So, Uli Kranz (CTO, then interim CEO) and the remaining engineers did what they do best, find projects to work on. Enter Hyundai.

While the partnership with Hyundai may not have been ideal, it would've doubled Canoo's cash on hand. With a world-class engineering team on idle, it seemed like a really great idea to reallocate resources. As the saying goes, one in the hand, is better than two in the bush.

However, in hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible deal. Keep in mind Canoo's skateboard cost $250m to develop. We initially speculated the Contract Engineering revenue was $34m, but on the earnings call, it turned out to be even less at $25m. Furthermore, it's very difficult to differentiate your own IP versus the work you've been contracted for:

* If you developed a better skateboard for your client, you cannot use this superior skateboard as it belongs to the client.
* If you developed a worse skateboard for your client, you've now knowingly given your client an inferior product (see [Tesla vs Fisker](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-vs-fisker-the-epilogue-or-why-tesla-owes-fisker-11-million-3052/)).
* If you give your client your skateboard as-is, the client just received a skateboard that takes 3-5 years to design/engineer and possibly billions ([Faraday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jia-yueting-faraday-future-tesla-rival-bankrupt-2020-1)) if not $500+ million ([Dyson](https://electrek.co/2020/05/18/dyson-cancelled-electric-car/#:~:text=Dyson%20has%20unveiled%20its%20abandoned,on%20its%20own%20electric%20vehicle)), for a measly $25m. Congratulations, you just played yourself.

As you can see, none of these scenarios are ideal for Canoo. If I were Hyundai, I'd be all over this deal too. No wonder Hyundai was so quick to jump on this deal, especially after announcing their partnership with Arrival just a month prior.

With this conflict of interest, I now see why many automakers are turning their backs to Apple. Why help a competitor to make a better product, for very minimal upside for yourself? As an engineer that signed up to join an exciting start-up like Canoo, would you be happy if you were pimped out to another company to engineer something that's not better, but not worse, but not the same, as something you've already created?

With that being said, Tuesday's price action was absolutely blown out of proportion, and I took advantage and bought GOEV warrants ($GOEVW) with both hands. Remember, we never knew details of the deal with Hyundai. Now knowing that the Contract Engineering would've produced minimal revenue, no royalties/on-going income, while delaying core projects, wouldn't you have cut this too? By killing the Contract Engineering, Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing tophats, factories and etc). For quick math, Canoo foregone $25m in contract revenue. Let's assume Magna would've charged $5000 for each vehicle. If Canoo instead reallocated resources towards building a facility, they would earn all that lost revenue within the first year ($5000 x 10,000 vehicles first year = $50m saved), while protecting their own IP.

Also, an important fact to consider was that Tony revealed that the contract value was based on labor of engineers (e.g. hourly rate), not value of IP. Meaning, Canoo charged a mark-up on top of their existing employee’s salary, rather than charging based on the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in IP they were receiving. While I do think Uli is a great leader, this was a great misstep under his watch.

With all the focus on the Hyundai agreement, we lost sight of gems uncovered in the earnings report/call:

* Internationalization. Lots of demand in Europe. International sales coming online soon.
* Better idea of cash on hand and operating expenses.
   * We are in a very healthy financial position. One-third of our market cap is cash. Canoo also has a mere $27m in current liabilities and &lt;$7m in long-term debt. **If this isn’t a deep value play, I don’t know what is.**
* Timeline and order of models have not changed: LV, MPDV, PU. We are still on track for production next year.
* Working closely with State Governors to obtain the greatest benefits/incentives.
   * These discussions could save tens or even hundreds of millions down the road. While I would’ve liked to get confirmation on Monday, we cannot rush this crucial process.
* Acknowledged Investor Relation's lack of communication.

Tony also stated some milestones to look out for:

* Gamma vehicle progress.
* Reporting reservations vs pre-orders.
* Lock in geographics and contract manufacturing partners.
* State level partnerships.

As of Tuesday’s close, Canoo had a $2b market cap. Canoo has $700m in cash, and IP worth anywhere from $250m to $1b+. In comparison, Fisker has a $5b market cap and virtually no IP, no engineering and no proprietary technology. Lucid, which has a \~$40b market cap, is worth 20x Canoo, yet, they are only months apart from manufacturing. Canoo at a $2b market cap (&lt;$10 share price) is an absolute steal in comparison to other players in the field.

**My bull case from last year still applies. The $18/$25/$30 price targets for management's earn out shares applies. I still have a $30 price target, which I'm confident we'll hit this year.**

**Positions: 130,001 warrants.** These warrants should be worth $18+ once GOEV hits $30.

**TLDR: Canoo's deal with Hyundai was terrible. Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing top hats, factories and etc). Production and model timeline is still on track.**",Canoo $GOEV - State of the Union - First Earnings Report,1.0,1617213771,PlaneReflection
