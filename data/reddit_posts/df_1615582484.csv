13,m3qzs6,"Let me preface this by saying I don’t mean to overhype GME. It’s nothing but speculation for fun, don’t take it as gospel. Overhype is a bad thing, but I still want to be able to put out my guesses. 

Anyway. So 3/12 didn’t go the way we were expecting but that’s cool, we still have 3/19 quadruple witching hour and someone buying a bunch of 3/19 800c today, volume on those looked pretty big to me, idk I’m an ape. 

But, here’s what I think is going on. Someone tried to orchestrate a gamma squeeze for today and it turned out the HF had more ammo than we realized. Someone got us on the short restricted list with that perfectly set up strike from 350 to 180 last Wednesday. Then did it again the day after. I think they did it to bleed out any shares the Hedgies were sitting on through Thursday to gamma Friday. But what I think happened is they under estimated how much ammo they had. 

So on Monday I bet we see a huge spike like we did Wednesday where someone loads up on a bunch of shares so they can keep SSRing throughout the week without using shorts, then mid day tomorrow we see a huge tank from a high price to somewhere in the neighborhood of 240-50s putting us on the short restricted list for Tuesday. That is if there is enough money left in the tank. On top of this we have stimmies coming in, so that should throw some more fuel on the fire.

Once we’ve been SSRed Tuesday the HF holding short positions have to sell any actual shares they have to suppress the price. Since our mystery whale will likely have bought a bunch on Monday they can short restricted list all week bleeding the hedges until quadruple witching hour Friday where they’ll undoubtedly have massive 3/19 calls again. I don’t think they’ll make the same mistake twice if they do decide to go in for round 2.

Obviously I’m not a financial advisor this is just speculation, don’t get your hopes up, but if it happens don’t forget me.

TL;DR:

1- $RIDE is a strong buy at current $15 price

2- It has huge upside due to multiple factors that all support a bull thesis.

3- $RIDE is potentially an American ""Rustbelt Revival"" story.

4- Share price has been knocked down artificially recently due to Hindenberg Report which announced short position, i.e. hedge funds are shorting/trying to destroy the unification of America. Betting on $RIDE is betting on America and on progress.

LORDSTOWN MOTORS ($RIDE)

Okay, fellow retards and all you true autists out there, listen up. I never make time to do this but I'm about to share some DD that leads me to believe that $RIDE is a strong buy right now.

I believe that $RIDE's current share price ($14.95 currently) potentially holds some--dare I say--deep fucking value to those that start getting in now at current prices. I've been meaning to do some DD on Lordstown for a while now. I've been on it since its pre-merger spac days and am LONG. Today's Hindenberg report was some serious bullshit, in my opinion, and a clear example of the kind of shit Cramer told us happens all the time. I am sure someone paid them for the take down in order to help calls in the $15+ range expiring they worthless. As we speak, there has been a battle to keep it below $15 for the past hour or two. It looks like RIDE just broke through, but the activity the stock today is NOT normal. I've been following this stock literally since before its inception, and its current price is the second lowest since merger, not since Oct 30 did it dip lower once, and it has surpassed $30 per share already on more than one occasion. Seeing it knocked down to $15 and below caused me write this shit up, because I think $15 is a STEAL and potential ten bagger as time goes on, if you go in long on it as I am. Even in the short term, I think calls will be printing and it was veryyyy interesting to see that despite the price drop today, premiums on my 3/26 otm calls went UP. There is some short action fuckery afoot, it would seem. But that's not the reason I'm bullish, as I've been bullish since its inception.

In my opinion, there is a reason why rating agencies (I think Morgan Stanley, iirc) recently downgraded RIDE and why the Hindenberg report dropped this morning. Hedge funds/big money/MM/whoever wanted this stock down today and calls not to print. But that’s all beside the point – back to the bigger picture.

My point is: BUY $RIDE and if you want to RIDE its eventual (if not imminent) return to $30 and beyond. $15 for RIDE is ridiculous. Its the only yet-to-sell-a-car US-based EV company that will actually be rolling thousands of units off the lines THIS YEAR. They have a large, former GM plant (as well as having big GM backing/investment), located right in the fuckin heartland of the USA in blue collar Ohio (which makes the company's badass name even more badass—Lordstown is actually the name of the city). The cars come from LORD'Stown, i.e. God's Country.

Aside from Lordstown being a cool name, more importantly, they have allies in Congress. It’s located in Rep. Tim Ryan’s district, and he is fighting for them. $RIDE will be bringing back jobs and helping to revitalize the area as it expands.

These articles talk in more detail about these issues and explains shit better than I can:

[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac)

And to top it all off, they have Joe Fuckin' Burrow as the company spokesman – with a pretty good ad campaign and marketing vision, I must say: [https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow)

Oh, by the way, Tim Ryan has already been pumping $RIDE to ~~Grampa~~ President Biden, and the talk is of America's ""Steel Valley"" to rapidly become America's ""Voltage Valley"": [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/rep-tim-ryan-invites-president-biden-to-visit-lordstown-motors-attend-voltage-valley-roundtable/ar-BB1d9xYh](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/rep-tim-ryan-invites-president-biden-to-visit-lordstown-motors-attend-voltage-valley-roundtable/ar-BB1d9xYh)

Need I say more!!? $RIDE is going to unite Blue and Red America as we embark on this EV revolution, by providing the first mass-produced electric pickup trucks this year. Hop upon this $RIDE to American EV dominance glory! It's a story of rebirth of the American Rustbelt. A rebirth of the shuttered Lordstown GM plant.

Hype aside, all I’m really saying is that I do indeed like this stock, and recommend y’all look into it and decide what you think. I welcome all the Hindenberg trolls’ comments.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Funko shares have been climbing for weeks now, and with the release of their killer earnings, the stock jumped almost 20% today. Not only are they heavily tied in with our almighty GME, they are also one of the only stocks you can invest in today that will have heavy ties to the rapidly growing NFT market. 

Adding some information from another post I saw recently by

[u/throwawaymyalias](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaymyalias/)

 **About FNKO:**

FNKO ([www.funko.com](https://www.funko.com/)) was founded in 1998, and is based in the Seattle area.

As per their website, ""Funko is one of the leading creators and innovators of licensed pop culture products to a diverse range of consumers. Funko designs, sources and distributes highly collectible products across multiple categories including vinyl figures, action toys, plush, apparel, housewares and accessories. Our aim is to provide consumers tangible ways to take their fandom offline.""

FNKO reported earnings yesterday, and widely beat all expectations.

Per share: 29 cents. Consensus beat: 123%.

Revenue: $226.51M. Consensus beat: 16%.

Moreover, FNKO has topped consensus revenue estimates four times in the last four quarters.

So, based strictly on the company's fundamentals (*ugh - fundamentals!*), it's a safe bet.

But... the real reason you should buy FNKO:

The CEO stated the company is entering the NFT market. And this has the potential to be HUGE!

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**So, why is entering the NFT market a potentially massive move by FNKO?**

**From NFT Report 2020:**

""The NFT market tripled in size last year, and its total value rose to more than $250 million.

Among the reasons explaining the market boost are global brands’ interests in NFTs. Fashion and luxury brands such as Nike, Louis Vuitton, Breitling, and sports brands like the NBA and Formula 1 have been actively creating NFT-based consumer goods and services.

In 2020, the total value of NFT transactions rose from $62.8M in 2019 to $251M in 2020, while active NFT wallets grew by 97%.

The NFT market could be considered the core asset class for the coming 'virtual economy.'""

(And the anticipated future of the NFT market? Read this: [https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/366648](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/366648) )

In other words, the NFT market, still in its nascent stage, is *rapidly* growing.

Moreover, the media has just barely began to cover the NFT market.

But I expect the hype will soon go into full gear, and when it does everyone from your wife's boyfriend to evil Wall Street pedos to angel-winged diamond handed retards will rush into (the currently very few) publicly-traded companies associated with the NFT market.

**And if your still not convinced there's big money to be made via the NFT market, some recent news:**

1. In 2020, Dapper Labs, in partnership with the NBA, launched a beta version of their NBA Topshot collectable and tradable NFT-based app, which they had been working on since 2018. In October 2020, it was announced that Dapper had exited the beta and opened it to all fans. As of February 2021, Dapper Labs was reporting over $230M in gross annual sales in the app.

86,m3rcte," This guy Ricky Gutierrez is approaching people on Instagram to invest in a platform called [www.smarttradestation.com](https://www.smarttradestation.com/).  Please be aware that this is a scam where they steal your money first  and then do not give you a single penny. First they tell you to invest  and once you start sending them money , they manipulate their website to  increase your profits. You can understand its not real because of the  huge returns they mark.

When you  want to withdraw they increase your account balance(example: Mine was 7k  before my withdrawal date, once the withdrawal date comes the balance  suddenly jumps to 25k. Then they say we have to pay 20% and 10% of that  total amount. Once you pay that they again increase your account balance  saying you made bonus and they again want another 20% of the that  without them sending a dollar to our account. I was fooled the first  time but later I stopped sending them money. Now this Ricky guys says he  will cover my 16k and then he wants me to send another 10k to his  account. This is just a scam and do not believe this guy. Just abuse him  if he ever approaches anyone of you. )",Fraud on Forex Trading by Ricky Gutierrez,1.0,1615583722,EquivalentAd7626
