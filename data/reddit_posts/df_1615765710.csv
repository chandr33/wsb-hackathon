QAnon request financial donations to benefit who, we do not know, with no ROI to the donor. At WSBs, there is no conspiracy or falsehood regarding the FACT that Hedgefunds GAMBLED with their investors' money and over shorted stocks. If anything, this has united people from all over the world for the purpose of lifting individuals up and supporting each other.

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

My position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go 🚀🚀🚀.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&amp;D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Second, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.",$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news.

40,m580g5,"This is a DD about GameStop's long-term. The squeeze is an extremely real potential but I want to help put things into perspective. 

Currently at $270 a share GameStop's market cap is roughly around $18 billion. Nintendo switches alone made almost 1.2 trillion dollars in 2020. There is absolutely no way you can convince me that in 18 billion market cap for GameStop is fair. Is GameStop transitions into e-commerce and begins to have a much more online presence I believe that seeing them at a 200 billion dollar market cap is quite modest.

I don't have the exact numbers to back this up to be clear. I could do some simple math and figure what stock price would be worth but in all reality nobody knows exactly how many shares are floating around of GameStop. I have calculated the amount of shares in existence of GameStop a couple different times through the last 3 months. When I first bought GameStop it was hovering around 49.5 million. I did it about a month ago and I got 165 million. Doing it right now as of Sunday March 14th there looks to be 65 million. I don't know exactly how many there are supposed to be because of conflicting information. But at the same time counterfeit shares could be not counted towards GameStops market cap. 

it is important to remember the original reason deepfuckingvalue invested. It was never to force a squeeze it was because he saw value in the long-term play on GameStop. $270 a share is a joke. $1,000 a share is a joke. I think this will probably SETTLE OUT around $2,000 per original share. This is after the squeeze as a long-term play. 

This simple idea could add more fuel to the fire for GameStops squeeze. Don't get worried, stop panicking. GameStop is worth more than this and is being suppressed by market manipulation and stubborn hedge funds. We won't, but we could literally stop buying and let natural action take its course on this and we would still probably see $2,000 a share. More people will become interested as more news is present.

I'm with the apes and autists family all the way. I have yolod my money into this everything I can spare because I'm confident. I know we're all looking to make a quick buck and come out of this wealthy as fuck. But take a step back and realize that this company is still undervalued watching the stock go up 100 200 $300 or back down to 40 don't sweat. People will paper hand it, it will happen but people did this with Tesla too and then they look back and saw $2,400% growth that they didn't get a piece of. 

Hold your shares, don't let price action right now ruin what is almost a sure thing.

TLDR:
GameStop is undervalued a 200 billion market cap is not a joke and very possible in the next year. Squeeze aside this company is undervalued in the long term don't let price action right now psych you out of an almost sure thing. It might be a slow burn but this thing is going to the Moon even if we have to build the steps up to it. 🚀🚀💎💎",What the fuck is an 18 billion dollar market cap on GameStop....

89,m58l9j,"So basically after 2008 bailouts became a given. When GME inevitably squeezes will this cause hyperinflation? I’ve heard a lot about Michael Burry warning of hyperinflation and I’m wondering if this could be a catalyst. 

If GME squeezes to 6 figures this will be significantly more than what’s on the balance sheet for these hedge funds. They will go bankrupt. The responsibility of this getting resolved will then go to the DTCC and then the FED. How will they pay for this? 100k a share is just south of a 7 trillion market cap. They will print it. Or as they like to say “provide liquidity”. The FED balance sheet is already a parabola along with our money supply. This will simply accelerate the parabola setting up a period of extreme inflation in the dollar.
