I'm trying to figure out how anyone can short GameStop? I'm using TD Ameritrade, it doesn't allow me to short it for the past 2 months. And I asked other brokers too. It's not possible at the moment. 

So how on earth anyone can still short GameStop? Do the big funds have their own brokers?

This is a link to a video where Edward Snowden talks about the scary place the world is heading with tracking all citizens. With the little guys here changing the way the financial system works. Breaking the power of hedgefunds, isnt Wallstreetbets our only hope to take over 'the system'? To think freely for ourselves, to steer the world the way we want it to go. Instead of following wherever big money and big power takes us. 

Last year the poor people of the world lost $3,7 trillion (or so) and the rich people gained that amount. The Corona crisis is the largest robbery in history. And now 'they' want to keep things going right. I dont believe in a great conspiracy, but I know history. Everywhere I see countries giving money. But like saving an airline company. What are they paying? Sure the personel, but mostly the loans to finance the planes. Our trilions go to who?? If a plane is grounded for a year it has to be payed! Why? It is not used, a little conservation maintance maybe. But its like a car, the mileage stays the same. So its only the lones that HAVE to be payed. 

But what if they are not payed? The people receiving it are the ones now getting richer and richer. Why not pause contracts. 20 or 21 years. We all are in this together, why not pause....

So some powerful people benifit and now we hastly introduce a system of total control. Please r/wallstreetbets isnt there a little guy way for us apes to be together strong?

P.s. I know this might not be the best reddit post for this discussion, but I searched and dont know what else to do, or where else to post my thoughts. The words of Snowden made me so sad, we are heading into very very dangerous times. My hope is on the little guys.

Hello fellow apes, the other day I posted a technical analysis on GME regarding a cup and handle pattern that I noticed while looking at the 3 month movement chart on my brokerage site. Due to my post gaining a decent amount of traction and there being a bit of confusion regarding the photos I posted, I just wanted to provide more information to everybody.

**1.)** In no way am I suggesting that anybody go and buy GME. I just happened to notice this formation and wanted to share it. I like the stock, what else can I stay?

**2.)** Everybody should know that a cup and handle chart can break three ways, it can break either up, down, or flat. However, based on the average daily volume that GME has been receiving over the last three months and the amount of people backing the stock I believe that this squeeze is very possible.

**3.)** Generally, the cup and handle shape takes a few months to form, it does not all happen in one day. That being said, the break will be gradual.

[GME \(3-month Growth Chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/lllhlb9dw7q61.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2584c6d5a31e2480d05d4bfa80faf48bbb34bdf0)

On top of this cup and handle analysis, I would like to talk about the fundamentals of GameStop as a company and why it is actually farther from a gamble than people think. Since January, the company has been building a fantastic team. They gathered executives from Google, Amazon, and the CEO of Chewy. On top of this, they have released news on how they plan on branching out into selling PC gaming products. Cohen has made it clear that he plans on fixing GameStop's e-commerce. PC  Since this past summer, they have been dipping their toes into hosting esports events. This with this being said, no, I don't think the stock will shoot to $500 over night, but does the company have the fundamentals to get their overtime? I definitely believe so.",Why GME is a long term investment,1.0,1617133562,OscarFromSharkTales

GameStop is also on the way to having a very strong business model. Firstly, GameStop acquired Ryan Cohen, the CEO of Chewy. There is no doubt in my mind that Cohen isn't going to transform the fundamentals of GameStop for the better. On top of this, the company also acquired executives from both Amazon and Google. The company plans to fix their e-commerce situation as well as branch out into selling PC gaming material. Also, the company is dipping their toes into hosting e-sports tournaments. So, do I think the stock could potentially go up to $500? Yes. Do I think that will happen over night? No. This will all be gradual, and if the fundamentals do end up strengthening, then there will be no need for the stock to ever dip down to under $100 ever again. So with all of this being said, apes stay strong and stay retarded.",Why us Apes Should Think About GME Long Term,1.0,1617134409,OscarFromSharkTales
