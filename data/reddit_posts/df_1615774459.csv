"")

6 hrs 33 mins agoBy **Corey Vallas**📷

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose will be in the Mahoning Valley Monday.

LaRose is scheduled to tour the Lordstown Motors Corp. facility in Lordstown tomorrow at 5 p.m.

He will review their progress and go over next steps with them in their effort to bring jobs back to Northeast Ohio.

LaRose's visit comes less than a week after a report by Hindenburg Research took aim at the company claiming that it misled investors.

The report called Lordstown Motor's order book a ""mirage"" and said the company paid an outside consulting group to generate preorders ahead of its deal to go public. They also accused the company of having undisclosed production hurdles.

Lordstown Motors issued the following statement Friday evening: 

""We will be sharing a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do, we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.""",$RIDE ; Sec. of State LaRose visiting Lordstown Motors Monday : Shorts are screwed : Hindenburg is a lair and a cheat,1.0,1615774737,joker3181986

Not... Not a weed stock.

Disclaimer: I am not a pot farmer. I am not smart enough to grow pot. I just planted my first crayon tree... So hungry... As such, this post offers no financial advice. I have VERY small position in $GRWG. 1x53c @ 1.20 3/19 and 10shs@$39

PSA: don't exit your favorite stonk mid squeeze, seriously...

----

I'm going to keep this DD short because I don't think there's much interest in it, and I'm not going to put a ton of effort in for you beautiful apes until after $GME earnings call. I'll offer an updated DD if I still like the stock. Bullets!

THE PROS:

* GRWG has seen parabolic growth

* It's not a weed stock. Hydroponics have a much broader market. Urban gardening and also weed...

* It's a weed stock and 4/20 is just over 1 month away.

* It's a weed stock and Mexico is on the cusp of legalization. (You may have noticed the rally in weed stocks.)

* 20% this week.

* Over 10x over the year.

* The dominant political party blaze up and down their side of the aisle. Bet.

* We're approaching a critical number of states with legal recreational use.


THE CONS:

* It's schrodinger's weed stock. Will benefit from weed rallies, but also it might not.

* Joey B said he wasn't going legalize it, but is he opposed if legislation reaches his desk?

* Scot's Miracle Grow ($GROW) is not sleeping on the scene. They've recognize the potential of the 'dro (however Scot's is not going to cater to weed)

---

TL;DR;

$GRWG is a strong play on Mexico's pending legalization of the pot. I want to target 4/20 with a $69 call. Depending on my favorite meme stock's action in the next couple of weeks.",$GRWG will grow your stimmies,1.0,1615774798,Soulsauce042689

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?
* Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?
* Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

## Investing in Internet Forums

In my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt;Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses websites - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information. 

[Pinterest is a search engine.](https://preview.redd.it/nv6rme6vm3n61.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d66cfd12f7dfe113f059548b78caf90273acea)

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

* Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
* Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
* Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
* Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
* Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.

## Searching

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pinterest user's \\""finding or shopping for products\\"" differential is extremely large.](https://preview.redd.it/ksemsx8jr3n61.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35d8453fe3817558695c5814bf53d6273a5347ed)

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair) 

\- Skincare ideas (Target) 

\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB) 

\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)

\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

&amp;#x200B;

[House Interior Paint](https://preview.redd.it/q8rx75d3p3n61.png?width=3718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c705c2365461dd710978c171cb1234695105dadc)

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

## The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

https://preview.redd.it/hdp9d130r3n61.png?width=2595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b5bcf48b44d76b0549bb8558a53db963999335

&amp;#x200B;

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary

I believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.

I'm hoping he says something to sour investment confidence and we get a small sell off. On Thursday there is a meeting between the US and China it might go bad and cause China to start selling their substantial US Treasury Position I feel like they are anyways with the way Yields have been spiking recently. If they sell enough of them the Yield on the Bonds will go so high that we get a serious market meltdown on Friday. The US might respond by taking action against China. China might finally say enough is enough and finally try to take Taiwan by force. Monday would be record breaking.

Or the market could do what it always does and go up &gt;\_&gt; and my puts expire worthless. As is Tradition.

# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?
* Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?
* Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

## Investing in Internet Forums

Let’s keep one question in mind:

&gt;Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses websites - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

[Pinterest as a Search Engine](https://preview.redd.it/v87cfq0xv3n61.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dc986edc0c68a5a506de566be8a0dad8ced6c1f)

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

* Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
* Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
* Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
* Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
* Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:

1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok). I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.

## Searching

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Pinterest users have an extremely high willingness to consume products.](https://preview.redd.it/bmho4mjyv3n61.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f657c48b9d1c707063abaf8cdbbd52e7785556f)

&amp;#x200B;

[A massive skew in customers that translates to families, husbands, friends, and local word-of-mouth.](https://preview.redd.it/ggksukf1w3n61.png?width=1936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc9ec0633ec584eb4477feb83c09be2bf1302958)

This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

\- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)

\- Skincare ideas (Target)

\- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)

\- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)

\- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

&amp;#x200B;

[Sherwin-Williams Painting Ideas](https://preview.redd.it/4yktmh6aw3n61.png?width=3718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a57e8cf06b77c89179ef298af82a80dd0277e6e4)

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.

Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

&amp;#x200B;

[The growing competition](https://preview.redd.it/li1aniqbw3n61.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e0aa87909dfe6bc27be6149c6b7d08dab313230)

&amp;#x200B;

## The Design

Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:

1. Security &amp; Privacy
2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
3. Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
4. Vectors for advertisers
5. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.
