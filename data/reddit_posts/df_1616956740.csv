You should put on **Dreamer‚Äôs Wake** by **Rival Consoles**.  It's good, smooth and you can just listen to Unravel next which should help you follow us down the rabbit hole of schitzo speculation

**God Damnit there is so much to talk about today** that it‚Äôs hard to know where to begin.  I think the usual disclaimer is that this is not financial advice and that you should make your own decision like a big boy and girl.

***Takes a hit of Copium***

**Price is not an indicator of value.**

Useful is to... perhaps recap...  the last week of price action as being something that was difficult to swallow as shares of GOEV began to approximate the cost of admission to your mom‚Äôs discount crotch circus but thank god we didn‚Äôt get that low. (By the way the quality of that spectacle really went down during her ""Groupon Phase"".)  The only consolation is that [GOEV accrued the most significant amount of short interest](https://u.teknik.io/KgmjB.png) in a small amount of time that I have ever seen.  If you can stomach the price drop and GOEV does return to the ring we are in a significantly better tactical position than we ever have been.

**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.

**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**

Micro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered 4 miles away.  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other‚Äôs FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall‚Ä¶ I mean football game.

So we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet‚Äôs views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool

But suddenly cn0110 busts in and says ‚ÄúHave you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!‚Äù.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.

This continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta booted down the door with a loop stick and tard wrangled everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of ‚ÄúVehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time‚Äù and ‚ÄúTheir electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo‚Äôs‚Äù.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said ‚ÄúGod dammit not again‚Äù.

**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a ‚ÄúSedan‚Äù like Canoo car this smells kind of like a ‚Äúnon-compete clause‚Äù.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.

Moreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause ‚Äú""*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.""  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.

**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**

**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**

**TLDR** \- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech provided by Divergent whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**

**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**

**P.S** \- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.

**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.",$GOEV - The Bull Case of Canoo Inc.

Now listed up /r/WSB and in particular my GME smooth brain, crayon munching Apes! For the man who had Diamond handed through all of this. For the man that has been ridiculed and laughed at and never wavered. When things get tough and we feel like we are crumbling toward loss porn he has reassured us. I often go watch his videos back to make me feel better about my, albeit small in comparison, GME play.

Now what do you get a man who isn‚Äôt a cat, whose wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend, who has wrinkles in his brains, and is about to be fuck you money rich when this all plays out? That got me thinking...a certain video sharing website gives people awards when they reach a subscriber count and currently he has 517k at the time of this post. Well that is good enough for silver but this man isn‚Äôt CNBC. 1 Millions gets you gold but this doesn‚Äôt look like a boomer to me. 10 Million though...that‚Äôs DIAMOND BABY! 

So what does everyone think? I would like to support him for all the memes and daily updates through this all. I didn‚Äôt know how else I could and a thank you doesn‚Äôt seem enough. I feel like what could make him wakeup with a smile the next time he logs in and see his subscriber count.

86,mf8hgz,"I started scraping hourly data from stock subreddits in the beginning of February and was obsessed for a couple weeks, then just stopped because analyzing it all became a second full-time job (my job is already in data). So I haven't done anything with it since, but it's kept on scraping

This was my answer to other stock alerting/trending products which would give top X trending/mentioned tickers along with some aggregated data. I wanted more than just trending or most mentioned (also figured it'd be a cool side project)

For example, I see value in knowing the difference in a ticker that's mentioned across all stock subs with little engagement, vs a ticker mentioned in only one subreddit that had tons of engagement. I see value in knowing if a heavily upvoted post had little comment engagement, and vice versa. I see value in knowing when was the first time a ticker was mentioned. Or what tickers are in some kind of ""sweet spot"" where they fall well below popularity but showing increasing momentum. Anyway, there's a lot of stuff I wanted to know that the alerting/trending products didn't offer (not knocking them, they're still very useful)

Turns out this didn't get to the predictive/inferential analysis I was aiming towards, but it did become an amazing information synthesis tool that sped up my research. I have all the data piped into Google Cloud Storage and have views in BigQuery that pull up the answers to my interests above, complete with links to each post, so I can delve further if needed. I built an MVP Dash app to visualize a couple of interesting things but didn't take it as far as it could go. I definitely burned out. But what's already there could be of value.

Anyway I was gonna let it keep going indefinitely and maybe pick it up again in a few months but figured maybe some people would find the raw data useful. No idea what direction I'd take it but interested in knowing if this would be useful, given all the products already available for reddit stock trending and alerting. Also the raw data would take a bit more data-savvy individual to parse through than say, something like Unbiastock which presents everything neatly. It's trading usability for granularity/flexibility and might be a barrier to wide usage of said raw data",Would people be interested in hourly raw data scraped from stock related subreddits?,0.91,1616961221,throwarawooo

Let‚Äôs Talk About ‚ÄúMarket Makers‚Äù

Getting Straight to the point.

There are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a ‚ÄúMarket Maker‚Äù.

However each license does not make you a market maker.

There are three different types of license holders:

\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),

\-Floor brokers

\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)

1.) The DMMs, formerly known as ‚Äúspecialists,‚Äù act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.

2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.

3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE‚Äôs goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.

Example of DMM Role:

On the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.

Each of the counters is a DMM‚Äôs post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs‚Äô posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.

Important: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.

Example of DMM Role:

Your clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM‚Äôs post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM‚Äôs post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer‚Äôs representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to ‚Äúwork‚Äù the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM‚Äôs post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM‚Äôs bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 √ó 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.

For a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM‚Äôs post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the ‚Äúcrowd.‚Äù In such cases, the DMM‚Äôs responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM‚Äôs post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.",Let‚Äôs Talk About ‚ÄúMarket Makers‚Äù,1.0,1616961958,OfficerTruth
