Also this is an Amazon backed company with alternative revenue possibilities besides food delivey,Opinions on the Deliveroo IPO for Early April.

* Chinese tech in the current political environment, 
* delisting threats,
* ADS/ADR structure and
* credibility of Chinese accounting.

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses to tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect to the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

Save a copy to your google drive and then there is only 2 inputs - Simply change the date (UK Format) to the 1st of what ever month we are in and change the Ticker (yellow boxes) everything else is auto

Given everything we know about float, who owns what, potential short interest. Say 20% of people sell out at $10k, would that fuck it for the rest of us, or at that point, assuming it jumped there quickly, would the stock, theoretically, continue climbing if the rest held?","Say the stock jumps to $10k in one day, how many people would have to sell for it to seriously hurt the chances of it going higher?",1.0,1617100959,Phimb

99,mgd3qh,"So, as many of you already know, Gamestop said in their K-10 that they would reserve the possibility to issue shares if needed but doesn’t see any need of right now. So my guess on if they would do it is the following: 
They might wait for MOASS to occur and when the Hedgefonds have their faces ripped of and Share Price is in the Millions and all GME investors are already millionaires but it’s still rising and not slowing down. Well at exactly that time they could issue new shares.
“Why?”  do you ask. Well if we see it from a outwards perspective they could praise themselves to be the saviour of the whole economy because they stopped the system from entirely collapsing. At the same time they would fix the huge sums to the company and make it worth whatever they take in by issuing new shares. So although the shares might eventuell my be worth less GME would still have liquidity if several billions just because of moass. And therefore the company would also be worth that! And they could take that money to transform the company as fast and the best way possible! And the company would be even worth more by that! 
TLDR:
Gamestop issues shares in hight of MOASS and therefore fixes the value to the company and can even use the liquidity to become the chewy of gaming. 

Sorry for the formatting, I am writing this in mobile and hope it’s working out",Why Gamestop might issue shares at one specific time,1.0,1617101095,benni248
