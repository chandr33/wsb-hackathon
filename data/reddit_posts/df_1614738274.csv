1,lwiwsj,"#  $ON  - ON Semiconductor 

First time DD -  Provide any constructive feedback, looking forward to your comments. (Flavour of tendie sauce)

We   are in a market shortage for semiconductors and the material to make   them.The shortage is so bad it is a detriment to production of many   other sectors and companies.

It's so bad it hits [boomers hard and us even harder.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[Ford](https://www.motortrend.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-automotive-ford-f-150/) and [GM](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/gm-extending-plant-shutdowns-at-three-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html) are having trouble keeping up.

GPU    and CPU shortages, shortages in the industrial sectors, and most    importantly shortage of tendies. That's right if you need tendies, you    need to get semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is high and  supply   is low, so what does that mean? Free trip to the moon with  tendies and  extra sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Good Stuff

$ON    Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for    various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in    automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances.

""Other    manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor    shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars,  whether   they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions  for  every  manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That  means  assembly   line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines  and  shop   equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and   microwave. It  even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending   it all after  you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the   toaster, which uses a   power switch, which are made by $ON. ""

They create [new electronic parts](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210217005026/en/ON-Semiconductor-Announces-New-650V-Silicon-Carbide-MOSFETs) for the market as often as I dream of making tendies.

Even innovating new technology. [World’s First Automotive Qualified SiPM Array Product for LiDAR Applications](https://www.eejournal.com/industry_news/on-semiconductor-launches-worlds-first-automotive-qualified-sipm-array-product-for-lidar-applications/).

[The    semiconductor industry is expected to grow every year exponentially    with the pent-up demand that will continue for years to come.](https://www.google.com/search?q=stonks+meme&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=u6efoi5-iFSDLM%252C1tK3bZ4IdEGK9M%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kQYuA_T6I_Oov2SaTU3RYEhCMrFog&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwio-I3F6pLvAhV5ITQIHUWCD2gQ9QF6BAgOEAE&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1098#imgrc=u6efoi5-iFSDLM)

A    new CEO was brought in with tremendous experience in the  semiconductor   industry (sound familiar?) that has experience growing  both revenues  and  margins at Cypress Semiconductors. **Hassane El-Khoury**; the man, the myth, a new tendie legend. Already a moving force in the semiconductor world, [he    was a pointing factor behind the merger of Infineon Technologies and    Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the  organisation](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/company/cypress-acquisition/) as ""one of the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers"".

I'm    a grower and not a show-er, so if you want growth you can actually   hear  it from me personally. This company is a killer for revenue   because  they are financially stable and very profitable as is this   play.

""The    one thing that sets   $ON apart from the rest of the equities on  this    list is that  they're  not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not  a    company that  simply  outsources chip production to other people     (overseas) and  who has  shown a willingness to keep some production in     house.   Matter of  fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that  he     wants to  maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.   Which     means  when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer  money   to    build out US production, they'll have their hands out.""

&amp;#x200B;

# USA's BBC (BIG BIDENS COMMAND)

Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-to-sign-executive-order-tied-to-semiconductor-shortage-11614177715)last week for “an immediate 100-day review across federal agencies to    address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products.   Those  four products are semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical   minerals  such as rare earths, and large-capacity batteries such as   those used in  electric vehicles"". **As well as the by-product of tendies.**

[Military Possibilities:](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/biden-to-order-supply-chain-review-to-assess-us-reliance-on-overseas-semiconductors.html)The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and    supply chains that are dominated by or run through “nations that are or    are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.”

Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent  of their chip makers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Throw your PT out the window its already hitting the moon

[Bank of America (BofA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bofa-double-upgrading-semiconductor-180553211.html)raises price target from $32 to $48. “We are late to recognizing ON’s    turnaround potential, but we still see potential for another 20%+  stock   upside as management makes the case for turnaround at their  upcoming   Aug. 5 analyst day"". ON top of the PT double upgrade!

&amp;#x200B;

# VERY BULLISH FOR SHORT AND LONG PLAY

Set your calendar dates to 100 days after the BBC $ON June 7, 2021.

Under priced options with low IV but why is there so much O/I? The market is bullish for this stock that's why.

$ON is a fierce competitor with an extremely experienced and competent CEO who already predicts when their [backlog](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/on-semiconductor-ceo-expects-auto-chip-backlog-to-end-by-third-quarter.html)   will end. Get in while you can for a short and long term   investment/play. An only opportunity to get options and stock while its   cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

# You want green, I want green, we all get green

""Additionally, $ON products find their ways into **vehicle charging** and **battery technology** which is also a growing area. Global drive for **power efficiency** will also increase in the face of the ""Green Deal"" and increasing global drive for **CO2 reduction**.""

&amp;#x200B;

# Did someone say short squeeze?

This    is not a short squeeze play, but if you hate shorts and know how to    squeeze a tiny one like I do my own, then jump on it for an [8% shares short ratio](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=ON) squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the stock and I am very bullish.

With that being said, I know for a fact 75% of you degenerates are tossing your Rocket profits into GME. You know damn right that’s what I’m doing. I sold the majority of my Rocket shares and will be yoinking the cash directly into GME tomorrow morning. With so many bozos making obscene amounts of bread today, there’s bound to be a massive influx of buy interest going on with GME in the coming days. 


There’s absolutely nothing more poetic than a Rocket taking GME to fuckin Pluto. If GME hits 1k I’ll chug dick and quad witch deez nuts. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

So I have been reading the posts here a lot while taking a dump and a thought crossed my mind.
What if all the meme stocks did a crossover like the Marvel and DC Movies?

Maybe on 19th March there are a slew of annoucement

GME buys over Super League or hires Ann ( based on a post about Ryan Cohen's tweet ) 

GME and AMC has a joint venture to hold super league tournaments at AMC theatres

BB signs on to provide the cyber security thingy that they do for all the transactions in the tournaments and etc

NOK provides the 5G infrastructure for streaming?

They all use silver medals and cups for the trophies

RKT manages the mortgages for houses the teams to train?

26,lwj15j,What people don’t understand is that stuff reopening is exactly why bond yields are going up. Our velocity of money will spike up and we’ll get the inflation from the 22% of our monetary supply we printed in 2020. And bonds have to compete with inflation. So yields will go up making the algos we use favor value instead of growth now. A simple way to put it is If bonds are 2.5% that’s like a 40 P/E ratio and the s&amp;p(the stock market) is at 39. Then you have to have compression in the markets. I know most people don’t understand how inflation can lead to lower stock prices in the medium term but it’s all over the news now if you watch so I’m not making things up. It erodes the future purchasing power and eroding the growth potential until the inflation hits the real economy boosting their bottom line. But until then bond yields will rally on our reopening and stocks will have to have multiple compression of the pe’s or  price to sales ratios if they have no earnings. The reason we have had this bull run was low yields and rates due to how bonds and stocks constantly compete for investor dollars so if rates are low they have nowhere to go other than equities. I know that a lot of you have been born in this bull run. as in haven’t seen a market that doesnt only go up. This multiple compression will happen if we get the new stim bill and open up like Texas. Thus overstimulating the economy and causing inflation that bonds will react to faster than the inflation hits companies bottom lines. it also effects the multiples of growth names due to yield competition.,Rant about bond yields,0.91,1614738740,Throwawayyyyy37

Well, y’all are sure acting like it with all these “Anyone pushing RKT is a bot/shill/hedge fund gay bear, buy GME"" posts. This is a place for more than one stock, and the rules explicitly go against any coordinated p/mp and dump. Let people enjoy their gains and talk about their moves for tomorrow without getting dogpiled by a bunch of smooth-brained twats who think anyone who doesn't fit their confirmation bias of something that still very well may not happen despite your deep desires for tendies is a bot. I was here for the first GME round, and from what I saw of the past before this all started, it was so much better than this bullshit right here and I wish the mods would do more to redirect the dumb mob mentality. It was all gung-ho after GME dropped and the bagholders suddenly saw the light and started acting normal, but some random sustained spike in price with a slight potential of an actual squeeze really whipped y'all back into the Qstonk type shit and now y'all don't know how to act right again.

Anyways, for those of you wondering I have 44.6@$37 $RKT (bought in at 29 then averaged up) but am planning on selling tomorrow at the post-open high before things tank and potentially buy back into GME or buy into UWMC. Regardless of this post, I do still like GME. Also, I can verify that I'm a human if some of you cultists don't believe.
