18,m21dpt,"I posted last week about why I like the CDR/OTGLY stock and I was surprised at how many disliked it got because fellow apes felt lied to/betrayed by CDR management. 

Look I understand, CDR was one of the good guys, Witcher 3 was excellent and contained no greedy micro transactions also they gave us tons of free DLC. We all thought we could trust them blindly and that was wrong. They let it go to their heads and thought they could get away with patching after release. But they did immediately start offering full refunds on all systems no matter time spent played. Also they did promise to fix the game and that is ongoing. 

Im not saying you should not be angry at CDR, you should be and you should not trust them until they have proven them self's again. But so far they are on the right track back.

Since I posted last time Citadel decided to start shorting the stock, on Tuesday they shorted 0.5% and by the looks of it other shorts have been piling on since then. Its hard to see in Europe because you don’t have to report short positions as long as you stay under 0.5% of market cap. But free float is only 66% of total stocks so short % of free float is almost double. At these levels I think this is a pretty stupid move and if the price starts moving up it will be very painful for them. 

My reasons for liking the stock still stand (check out the link for more details), sales numbers still looks to be good, Cyberpunk can still be redeemed to a good extent and the combo of Netflix Witcher season 2 + Witcher AR game on mobile has the potential of being huge. And its down +60% from top.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxi6c0/fellow_apes_retards_and_other_degenerates_may_i/

So ask yourself this: How much do you dislike the company that fucked up Cyberpunk 2077 launch but that did make Witcher 3, has apologized, offered full refunds no questions asked and has started delivering on fixing the game? Now place that dislike against the chance of making a profit and as a bonus it will be on Citadels expense. 

Disclamer: Im not saying buy the stock just because Citadel has shorted it and they will be hurt if the prices move up. I’m saying I like this stock and that there is a real buy case at these levels.","Ok so you don’t like what happened with Cyberpunk 2077, but ask yourself this",1.0,1615393561,JavveTBDer

My 11 year old daughter has been a frequent to GameStop like I was as a child and it’s been something we can enjoy together during this rough time. She loves to learn so we talk about what goes on in the world including the markets. She likes the stock, probably because of all the moon talk and fancy rocket ships, so we literally scraped together enough to buy a single share of GME with $9.00 left over. We decided that this share is hers and she was excited to have her ticket to the 🌕. I’ve struggled my whole life paycheck to paycheck but giving her the chance to get a head start in her life is epic.
