58,ly4lze,"I want to share the very definition of a gamma squeeze. People keep pushing a gamma squeeze but don’t actually  know what a gamma squeeze is.

“In a gamma squeeze, the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks. “

The reason gamma squeezes are even a thing is because of this.... They don’t have to own shares to sell you shares. Therefore not really costing them much. With options, because they are more riskier and more volatile they have to make sure they have those shares available. Which causes them to hedge those options. Thus costing them more than it would if they just sold you shares. 

Where the gamma squeeze actually happens is when you have multiple weeks of high options volume coupled with options expiring in the money. High volume call option purchasing drives the price up which In turn helps the upcoming expiring contracts to expire in the money causing them to be covered which causes the price to go up even more. Now one week of this most hedge funds can recover and regroup from but multiple weeks they cannot. Often times at this point (if the stock isnt already heavily shorted) any short positions begin doubling down often leading to the stock to be shorted. This is why gamma squeezes can lead to short squeezes (though not a guarantee)

I want you to understand the simple concept of what a gamma squeeze is, so you aren’t just expecting something you haven’t fully understood yet. More less just throwing money into a stock aimlessly. 

You may not like what I’m saying but anyone who knows anything about a gamma squeeze knows I’m telling the truth. I’m just simply wanting people to understand what a gamma squeeze actually is. And that each day that passes that option volume does not increase the less likely a gamma squeeze can happen. 

You can refuse to acknowledge the facts or you can simply understand the fundamentals of what a gamma squeeze is. A gamma squeeze is not something that magically happens, it’s happens with consecutive weeks a high volume of options investors with calls expiring in the money. Yes borrow interest, SSR, etc are all great things but those things alone don’t cause a gamma squeeze. Increased option volume forcing sellers to hedge the shares for those options is the very definition of a gamma squeeze. Borrow Interest, short available, SSR, etc aren’t some magic wand. They just set up the ability for a gamma squeeze to happen.

On another note...There is also a quadruple witching date coming up on 3/19 (if you don’t know what it is just type it in your google search engine and read) which adds to the possibility for a gamma squeeze to happen. The day alone doesn’t guarantee anything. In addition to that Friday was great and those FTD’s helped the possibility of a gamma squeeze but that alone won’t cause it. 

I honestly would imagine hedge funds laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without actually buying a lot of options. Actually I know they would be laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without buying a lot of options because you can’t have a gamma squeeze without buying a lot of options. It’s like trying to start a car with no gas. High volume of options investors is the gas for a gamma squeeze. Without gas (options investors) that car (gamma squeeze) goes no where. And if you only fill that car up once (FTD’s from last Friday 2/26/21) it’ll start, but it will only take you so far before it runs out of gas. 

I wouldn’t share this if I didn’t want to see all of the people that have invested money into AMC win. I want to see you guys win. It would be a sad day if I sat back while you hope for a gamma squeeze and not tell you what a gamma squeeze actually is. Great night apes!

This is not financial advice. Just a mere essay teaching gamma squeeze basics, class 101. Thanks to this community because every other community has silenced me. It’s really led me to believe that some of these communities are ran by hedge funds themselves trying to manipulate people and lead them astray. I had speculated that but the fact they delete my post explaining how to properly execute a gamma squeeze on certain Reddit and discord communities seems real sketchy to me.

93,ly4ykn," None of this is financial advice, nor am I telling anyone to buy/sell stock. This is my opinion based on the most recent public information I could find. Your investment choices are yours alone and I'm not a professional by any stretch. This is a casino. Now with that out of the way...

The reason SNDL is currently down is a combination of hedgefund shorting, daytrade usage, but also simple market correction. It looks like most cannabis stocks have undergone a market correction this week. I'm not that worried. I'm just gonna hope that their next financial statement is sexy and that the next one is even sexier.

Despite its infancy as a company, I believe Sundial Growers is drastically undervalued and can become highly competitive. I personally plan to hold for awhile.

At the time of writing this, SNDL is at a dip and I don't think it will last long. This company is far more than a PnD. My plan is to go for a long hold and buy more when I have the chance.

This is why...

Consider the following:

\-Recently acquired NASDAQ compliance. If the value of their stock stays above $1 by June, they'll maintain that compliance and likely be in good shape to keep up their upward trend.

\-On Dec 21 2020, Sundial announced that it has paid off all debts. Compared to other cannabis companies, this is huge.

\-Their new equity, allowed them secure $600M in cash. They should be stable for the foreseeable future.

\-Sundial Growers has undergone management changes; presumably because of the number of serious setbacks in previous years. Mold, fires, air circulation issues, everything you DON'T want to see in a cannabis company. In January they have switched out Torsten Kuenzlen for Zachary George. While this could be a reason to be alarmed, here's a quote from newswire.ca :

""Mr. George brings a wealth of experience to Sundial having spent more than 15 years evaluating catalyst-based investment opportunities across the capital structure of North American companies with a focus on real assets.  Mr. George has worked in a management capacity, including as a Chief Executive Officer with numerous corporate boards to turn around operations, effect corporate action and implement governance policies in order to maximize shareholder value.

Mr. George co-founded the alternative investment platform FrontFour Capital Group LLC and currently serves as a trustee and director on the boards of Cominar REIT and Trez Capital Junior MIC.  He previously served as the Chairman of the boards of FAM REIT and Huntingdon Capital Corp., as the lead independent director of both Cornell Companies Inc. and PW Eagle Inc., and on the boards of Allied Defense Group Inc. and IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund.""

\-Now consider the fact that despite having to solve these issues, they managed to become debt free. I believe the credit can be attributed to their new management and their financial restructuring.

\-Earlier this month, they had a market cap of 1.3B. It's currently 1.8B. An incoming 5B market cap is not unrealistic and legalization efforts around the world will likely increase the market cap for multiple cannabis companies not just SNDL.

\-American legalization does matter here. Just because they are Canadian, doesn't mean they won't export product to the US. Same goes for any other non-American cannabis company. Americans love weed and cannabis companies know it. Whether or not legalization happens this year, it's a political inevitability at this point.

\-Sundial has also been making moves that suggest expansion efforts. Quote from nasdaq.com:

""There's one company that's been of interest to Sundial Growers of late, and that's microcap cannabis stock **Zenabis** (OTC: ZBISF). On Dec. 30, 2020, Sundial announced it had acquired a special purpose vehicle that at the time owned 58.9 million Canadian dollars worth of Zenabis's senior secured debt. Sundial will also collect a royalty under the agreement of between 2% and 3.5%, depending on the company's net cannabis revenue.

Zenabis made a payment on that debt of CA$7 million on Dec. 31, 2020, but Sundial still issued it a notice of default. Zenabis contests the default and, in a statement issued on Jan. 6, says that ""Sundial made such investment in an attempt to coerce Zenabis into being acquired by Sundial."" Zenabis says that prior to Sundial's investment, it was in discussions with its lender to get an extension on its CA$7 million debt repayment. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of just CA$4.8 million, and so liquidity is a clear concern for Zenabis."" This quote is what is making me hopeful about their next earnings report on March 17.

\-A lot of investing and stock websites (i.e Motley Fool) are advising against SNDL. Thankfully we're retarded. If my time on this subreddit has taught me anything, it's a sign that they want the price to stay low. In my personal opinion their analysis is shallow and probably motivated by hedgefund worries.

\-When it comes to cannabis companies, I don't rely on revenue info alone. Plenty of cannabis companies are struggling to be profitable.

\-Sundial is preparing to release a new line of products with higher THC potency to meet the increasing customer demands. They have made some drastic adaptations to their cultivation processes over the last six months and according to their new CEO, the nature of Sundial growing facilities enables the company to stay on their toes.

Quote from Zachary George (CEO) ""Since inception, we've compiled a broad spectrum of cultivation statistics, including more than 600 harvests, including 243 in 2020 and 52 in the third quarter alone. Sundial has leveraged his data analytics capabilities to focus on key improvement areas. I am proud to say that **just last month in October we generated the highest average potency results since Sundial's inception…**”

\-Sundial has also gotten ahold of some promising cannabis genetics which they expect to have tangible financial impact in 2021. They have also been able to slash their costs and improve their efficiency. CEO quote: ""We exited Q3 with lower costs, greater efficiencies and dramatic improvements to our balance sheet. Despite underperforming on revenue, we reached several key operating milestones. As we continue to improve our processes, we are also working to elevate our customer experience while driving long-term growth…” (Found on Yahoo Finance) After reading through their financial statements, can confirm.

And last but not least...
