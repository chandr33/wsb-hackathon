**POSITION 3000 SHARES AT $10.15**

I’ve been saying for years that the two most irritational groups of consumers are new parents and new pet owners. There is almost no limit as to the amount of money they are willing to spend on their babies and their furry 4-legged friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of the many reasons why I think Owlet is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this baby-tech trend which combines wearables, health monitoring and critical data to provide a better solution for newbie parents as well as pregnant women (with their newest product the [pregnancy band](https://owletcare.com/pages/band)).

2019 revenues:  $49.8 million

2020 revenues: $75.2 million (est)

2021 revenues: $107.2 million (est)

2022 revenues: $174.7 million (est)

2023 revenues: $316.4 million (est)

2024 revenues: $581.4 million (est)

2025 revenues: $1,064.5 million (est)

&amp;#x200B;

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

A decade ago we said “content is king” — Now we say “data is king”

In terms of competitive advantages for Owlet, I see many of them which I’ve listed in no particular order:

1. current product portfolio
2. product pipeline
3. existing retail distribution with more on the way
4. 1+ million existing customers
5. FDA clinical trials already underway
6. robust R&amp;D process
7. $300+ million on the balance sheet
8. strong brand awareness and NPS scores
9. strong patent portfolio \[[click here](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD781568S1/en)\]
10. seasoned management team

**FINANCIALS:**

Sometimes you have to take these 5 year financial projections with a grain of salt because you really don’t know how the company is coming up with them despite their best efforts to show charts and graphs. In the case of Owlet I actually think they have a good shot at hitting these numbers — assuming we get a couple more innovative products (not including the pregnancy band), more b&amp;m retailers and of course some international expansion. I think the TAM for baby-tech products is enormous and will grow rapidly in the coming years because the core audience is millennials in their 20s and 30s with disposable income and the desire to own the best products in every category. I’m convinced that Owlet is going to be the leader in both baby-tech and the connected nursery.

Hopefully the company can meet their gross margin goals which will help them get to profitability within the next few years. I rarely worry about my portfolio companies losing money in the short term in order to invest in growth, product development, expansion, sales, marketing and capturing market share. The only way you build a $10 billion company is to forgo profits in the short term and instead focus on growing those revenues and building a strong ecosystem for customers.

**VALUATION:**

As I mentioned above, I think valuation on Owlet is extremely reasonable although if I’m being honest I think it’s ridiculous this company is not already trading at 15-20x 2021 sales especially when I look at some of the companies below and see their multiples. We already know that Owlet is trading at 10x 2021 EV/Sales with 60-80% revenue growth potential going out to 2025 and improving gross margins. This stock is about to hit the radar for tens of thousands of investors over the next few days and I’m glad they’ll finally be paying attention. I’m pretty pumped up for this company if you can’t tell — I just appreciate how massive this market is going to be for Owlet and I believe they have the team, products and resources to dominate.",$OWLT - Owlet Baby Care TO THE MOON VIA BECKY 🚀,1.0,1614699443,pound_salt_

We are so close but I think we can all agree we need to beef up our pockets to make a mega push together.  We are all here for one main goal and that is making money together and removing it from the pockets of the big hedge fund companies thence placing it into ours!!!  CAN WE ALL AGREE?  So let’s beef up our pockets right now today, we all have the opportunity as we always do to come together and take aim at something we can all afford as we know the GameStop stock has sky rocketed in price and if we all want to continue pushing together we need to liquidate some more money into our pockets to do so in which Sundial is the perfect target to make a massive push today and then all earnings we take together from this we use to make history in the GSE push.  This is a one day squeeze here with a stock starting under $2.00 at the current time in which we can all afford to buy and use to beef up our pockets to make our GSE HISTORY PUSH.  I come to my fellow reddit people, we started this together and we shall continue this together. This is one of the most wonderful things to see is when the people come together as a whole in aims to make something special happen and we are right here so close.  So I say to everyone, while it is on the low side, let’s make this money together and continue riding this rocket into history on the biggest squeeze of all time.

67,lw4zw5,"Back in January, when everybody was buying up shares and call options on $GME, $BB, $AMC, $NOK, and $SLV the banks and big wall street took noticed. 

**For $SLV, expiring March calls were bought six times higher than usual.** 

So isn't it surprising that with the stimulus package quickly moving through the House and will probably pass fairly quickly through the Senate, and the fact that demand for silver metals have gone up, the price for $SLV and silver miners have been going down? 

**Well, $SLV is very easy to manipulate, since it's all paper. Like what proloystar posted a few weeks ago, they may be using all of our $SLV money to actually short silver.** Read his post if you need a reminder &gt;&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/ 

**It's obvious that $SLV doesn't carry the amount of silver metals it says it is carrying, and that big fund managers and banks are trying to drive the price down to avoid paying off contracts and earning a grip load of money in the process when the price of SLV should be shooting up?** OUR MONEY IS BEING LOST in SLV while everyday we hear stories of inflation, and that people would rather put their money into shitcoins, stocks, and pokemon cards rather than cash. And the fat cats are making a fuck ton of money off us**SO FUCK BIG WALL STREET TRYING TO SCREW US OVER.**

AS PROLOYSTER STATED BEFORE, WE CAN FIGHT THIS BY
**GOING TO A DIFFERENT EXCHANGE AND BUY PSLV AND SILVER MINERS** There's a reason why Robinhood (fuckin thieves decided to halt the trading of PSLV on their platform, even though now you can trade GME, AMC, BB etc. SLV is easy to manipulate for them, PSLV is not because they are more transparent of their silver holdings. It's a closed end fund, and they won't create new shares unless they actually acquire more silver. 

**BUY ACTUAL SILVER** Difficult to do, especially with the high premiums they put on to stop us from driving up the market. But if you can do it. Otherwise buy PSLV on a different exchange. Got it?
