40,m0p00f,"Hello everyone, this is my first DD post, I hope it isn't too shitty......

OK, so the company I am talking about, is Instacart.

What is Instacart? If you ever ordered groceries online in the US or Canada then you probably have heard of it or had your online grocery order fulfilled by this company somehow.

Instacart is America's largest online grocery retailer, with partnerships with major US and Canada retailers nationwide, along with some smaller scale regional grocery stores. Instacart has more than 500,000 ""Full Service Shoppers"", independent contractors whose job is to accept customer orders and fulfill them within the given timeframe. 

Since the pandemic, Instacart's business has been booming. It recorded it's first net profit of $10M in April 2020 and it currently has a market value of $39B as of March 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

What is good about Instacart?

1. Instacart has partners like Walmart, Costco, Aldi, Target, Rite-Aid, Kroger, and many other big-name grocery stores, which allows it to get access to a huge customer base. It also has partnerships with some regional smaller grocery stores that mainly cater to certain groups of people, which can increase it's exposure.
2. Instacart is easy to use, and it's interface isn't that hard to understand. The most IMPORTANT thing is it's convenience. Just tap, and your groceries will be right at your doorstep right away(just an exaggeration)

&amp;#x200B;

What is bad about Instacart?

1. Like other gig companies, Instacart marks up the prices by at least 10% and charges service fees for all orders. This results in higher prices than in-store.
2. Shoppers are unhappy about the base pay they are given for certain orders. Since they get to see how much they are paid for if they complete an order, they may intentionally reject to do unfavorable orders, resulting in long wait times and unhappy customers, thus making customers reluctant to order on Instacart again.

&amp;#x200B;

What good and bad do I see on Instacart in my opinion ?

1. Instacart has seen it's business boom since the Covid-19 Pandemic began, and it will continue to prosper if people are forced to stay at home.
2. Instacart's base pay is terrible on certain orders, plus some customers(including the CEO) do not tip for unfavorable orders. This results in some customers having bad experiences on the platform which in turn makes them less likely to use Instacart again.
3. During the 2020 US election, Prop 22 in California has passed, which Instacart supported. Now Instacart can raise it's prices to ""provide benefits"" for it's shoppers, while increasing it's profit margins(since they do not need to provide employee benefits to shoppers as mentioned in Prop 22). But, because of this and other controversies(such as firing unionized workers
4. The online grocery business has boomed, and Instacart is finding new rivals, such as Shipt(A.K.A Target, since Target owns Shipt), which can potentially reduce Instacart's market share.
5. Some stores have been piloting curbside pickup programs, which may potentially affect Instacart's revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I think Instacart is going to be a OK buy, as long as the pandemic is not over, but some people have been talking about shorting the stock if it ever IPOs.

Edit: this is not financial advice


As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.


First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.


Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.


This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.


Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves

Seeing the incredible DDs here that teach me way more than any boomervesting news outlet ever did, has inspired me to learn as much as I can about the stonk market.

I've been really depressed and struggling to find the motivation for studying programming to get a job, but I had the realization recently, due to this sub, that I can combine those interests into something that can get me a job and can make me personally profit

I'm going to put effort into learning algorithmic trading with Python and getting a solid understanding of the stock market as a whole, and get a job in fintech.

You guys are helping make an ape into a coding ape.
