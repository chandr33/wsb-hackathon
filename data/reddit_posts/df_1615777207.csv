33,m5bhj5,"Why don't you have a seat if you dare retard, I'm going to give you a lesson you didn't want or need. The words you're about to read can't be unread and may haunt you to your shallow unmarked grave. Just to make sure you understand that I'm going to use some pictures:

#🦍👀📪, 🦍💀🚫🍗

What's the *worst possible thing to do with money?* If you said throw it into a big pile and burn it you'd be wrong; at least in that case you would have a little warmth. If you said finance terrorism, yeah that's probably it.

If you said use it to purchase options expiring the same day you purchased them, why, that's also pretty fucking bad. And wrong. In fact there should be a new word to describe it: Badong. 

#Purchasing options expiring the same day you purchased them is badong.

#This is financial advice.

So why do people do this? If there's one thing you can count on it's your chromosomes, and the more you have the higher you can count. I take off my shoes to count my chromosomes, which is why I'm qualified to explain this to you.

Let's say your cousin by marriage on your sister's side and birth on your mother's side told you his daddy's company Goober Corp. is going through a major merger and they were going to print some bitchin tendies. It's happening real soon and you're the only person on the planet who knows about it other than the hedge funds about to pump the price sky high. You don't have any choice, you're going to HAVE buy this option today, but it expires in 4 hours! The option's not even in the money but you *know* that stock is going to go up right at the last second and make you a millionaire. This is a no-brainer which is right up your alley which is also where you keep your crayons warm.

Since it's 4 hours to expiration, this option is $1. Why would you only buy one? You decide to buy 10,000 knowing that stock is going to go up in the last hour of trading day. 

The clock is ticking down and it's 1 hour from market close. $GOOB suddenly jumps up 17% and your options leap in value from $0.23 to $1.20 apiece. Even though they aren't in the money the volatility is making them a necessary purchase for hedge funds. 

Hedge funds will often buy options they don't care about expiring worthless as a 'hedge' against other positions they have, meaning unlike you they don't care if the options expire in the money or not because it's part of a larger trading strategy which minimizes loss. To put that another way if those options did go into the money for the hedge fund something else would have gone horribly wrong and they would need to fall back on them.

Minimizing loss is foreign to you. Papa didn't raise no wussy web toe loser. You're a web-toed winner. It's tendy town or bust, you mutter to yourself, I'm holding these to expiration for maximum gains! Sure they're not in the money yet but this stock is definitely going to go up all the way until they are in the money and make you rich. As. Hell. why would you sell for a measly couple thousand gains??! That's for  donkeys with leaflets of compressed emulsed and dried wood fiber where their upper locomotive appendages should be.

20 minutes left in the day. Your options are 50 cents away from being in the money. If the stock goes up just 51 cents your options will be exercised at close and you'll make money. Because of all the volatility they're all so jumping around. You could easily set a limit price and sell them probably for even more than double what you paid. $1.40, $2.10, $1.75... the price is jumping around as $GOOB goes up and down.

...

Well you can guess how this story ends. If you had sold in the last 20 minutes of the day you would be up about $2,000-6,000, but when the day closes your options are just under the money and expire totally worthless. $10,000 down the drain. Fuuuuuuuck.

Congratulations, now you're trading the Wall Street Bets way, and you should probably have your finances taken over by a state caregiver. Post your loss porn so we can pump and dump our genital fluids.

I couldn't be more proud of you, incompetent retard, because I reserve that emotion for my dog when he manages to not eat his own poop. And I don't have a dog.

And now you know the only investment strategy Wall Street Bets will respect. It's kind of like how the only way to impress the Jackass crew was to staple your nutsack to your leg or dive off a ladder onto swimming pool full of hundreds of floating wooden mouse traps.

TL;DR at bottom.

I’m along for the GME ride with 121 shares at $131 avg price. Been sitting quietly in shadows reading the amazing DD that some of you have posted while trying to absorb knowledge, fact check, and learn as much as possible. I am in love with this stock and I have enjoyed blasting the back of my throat with the explosive firehose full of DD, Google searching, and your wife’s boyfriend’s ejac.

It just so happens when the first GME round happened that I viewed my birthday as a significant date. As I’ve continued to hold and buy when able, I can’t help but see the news and other significant happenings next week from the collective discussion and DD from you apes. 

So if this is fate for me, that it brought me here for a reason, then I feel prudent pulling in insignificant data and giving you a PT. Knowing it’s all bullshit and that I’m just holding and buying - below is the breakdown of how I came to a $783.84-$795.50 3/19 PT for GME which is also my 30th bday. 

Again, I’m not making financial advice or telling you to buy or sell, but I am saying that I like this stock and for all of us I’m hoping we can all enjoy next Friday together. 

Here is my work:

- GME IPO (in days on 3/19/21) = 6,794
- My IPO (in days on 3/19/21) = 10,958
- My IPO time = 9:36A EST
- Ryan Cohen age = 34-35 (12410 to 12775 days old)
- Letters in my college’s name = 6
- # of exes who left me for other guys = 2
- Favorite number = 65
- Letters in Keith Gill’s name = 9
- Letters in GameStop ticker (GME) = 3

1. I figured how much older my IPO date was compared to GME’s IPO
- (My IPO Days - GME IPO Days)/GME IPO Days
- (10,958 - 6,794)/6,794 = 0.5712 or 57.12%
- This means my IPO is 57.12% older than GME’s

2. Now I figure out what 57.12% of Ryan Cohen’s age (34 to 35) in days. This is where the “range” will come in. 
- Bottom range: At 34 years old: 57.12% X 12,410 days = 7,088.59
- Top range: At 35 years old: 57.12% X 12,775 days = 7,297.08

3. From here I have a floor and ceiling to start working off of to determine the 3/19 Price Target Range. I now have to account for how many exes left me for other men into the floor and ceiling from #2
- Bottom Range: 7,088.59 / 2 Exes = 3,544.29
- Top Range: 7,297.08 / 2 Exes = 3,648.54

4. Okay we’re getting close now. The # of exes that left me is 2 so it halved the top and bottom of the PT range. Now I’m able to divide in the letters of my college’s name, which is 6. 
- Bottom: 3,544.29/6 = 590.715 (rounded up) = 590.72
- Top: 3,648.54/6 = 608.09

5. Now I take the time of day in which I IPO’d which is 9:36 and factor that into total minutes since midnight = 576 total minutes it took for me to IPO on 3/19 years ago. This number is now added to the top and bottom numbers from #4 and then get the average
- Bottom: 590.72 + 576 = 1,166.72/2 = 583.36
- Top: 608.09 + 576 = 1,184.09/2 = 592.045 (rounded up) = 592.05

6. Next is to take the square root of my favorite number (65) and then multiply that into the bottom and top numbers
- Square root of 65 = 8.062
- Bottom: 583.36 x 8.062 = 4,703.05
- Top: 592.05 x 8.062 = 4,773.11

7. Last step is to subtract the # of letters in GameStop’s ticker from the # of letters in Keith Gill’s name, and the divide that into the PT bottom and top range from #6 above to get the range. 
- (Keith Gill’s letters - GameStop ticker letters) = 9 - 3 = 6
- Divide into bottom: 4703.05/6 = $783.84
- Divide into top: 4773.11/6 = $795.52 (rounded up to nearest penny)

So looking at this analysis and considering if/why fate brought me here - my GME 3/19 PT range is is between $783.84 and $795.52. 

TLDR - my birthday coincides with quadruple witching day which is the end of the week that holds significant events and DTCC rules potentially going into effect. I feel the universe brought me here. I don’t know what to do with my hands but my 3/19 GME PT is $783.84 - $795.52.",My IPO and Quadruple Witching Day,1.0,1615778986,zmorgan65

It's almost like Hertz has a bunch of rental cars they couldn't rent out last year because Corona kept us quarantined.  Once this quarantine ends however the new digital nomads in the economy are going to travel because they can work remotely.  This means people are going to rent cars after they are vaccinated.  There is a powder keg of energy in the economy right now, people want to be free.  

Now let's look at the option chain: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Look at all those JUICY JUICY JUICY ITM puts compared to calls.  All going up!](https://preview.redd.it/ba8ot4n654n61.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45cc61d3b8a0cff0ff3d55eac1d91f900530b1f9)

Need I say more about the above call option chain?  Those puts are going to be exercised.  

Balance sheet: 

&amp;#x200B;

[They can afford to pay their bills, in a pandemic!  ](https://preview.redd.it/9jirmlqi54n61.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbde05ed546c954284f589ea5abf2d0cb0b3b129)

They have an okay balance sheet IMO.  W/ over $1BILLION dollars of cash on their balance sheet to afford their upcoming bond notes this year.  THIS IS GOOD!  THEY ARE NOT GOING BANKRUPT! 

Weaknesses to my DD: I don't know anything about the management team.  They could be morons.  

My moves: none, I'm balls deep in GME until this over.  This move is for you Apes willing to do the DD to prove me wrong (or right). 

Conclusion: When quarantine ends many people are going to take their job on the road.  They're going to put everything in storage and rent their vehicles from Hertz to explore the world while they work remotely.",HERTZ - An Fundamental Analysis Pay - DD,1.0,1615779974,Iam_nameless

83,m5c01a,You guys should quit the adoption shit and pool together for world wide UBI or even just UBI for USA and Canada. Then we would have a means of saying FU everytime these suits wanna beat on the middle class worker. It's the ultimate FU to everyone involved and you guys seem powerful so one of you should open a bank that offers accounts that pay everyone a passive income aswell based off UBI currency flow.
