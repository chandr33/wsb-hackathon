Lately their short positions were going to pan out well for them until we came along; they recalculated, manipulated, forged and set their sights on the most logical thing they could next. Now that WSB has such heavy weight on the markets, the new 9.5M strong retard on the block says 'X' and they act accordingly. while all of you are sticking true to our self proclaimed title of retard/autists, a large portion of us have become pigs and you’re going to be slaughtered.
