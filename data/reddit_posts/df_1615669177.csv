37,m4fnyd,"I think short interest doesn't really matter, even if at 10% (which I doubt anyway)

Excluding retail the % held by insiders + the % held by institutions (mostly passive funds, ETFs, etc) is around 150%. 

They simply can't close all position. Insiders won't sell that much. Institutions are mostly passively managed, thus more diamond hands than us apes.

If we add retail we may get some % points of diamond handing. 

THEY BROKE THE SYSTEM, THEY CAN'T CLOSE ALL OF THE SHORTS.
