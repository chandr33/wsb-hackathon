Today’s wild swings were caused by institutional investor sell off and further hedge fund antics. Retail investors are holding. If there is volatility, it’s only because the “experts” are gaming the system and losing at it.

Disclaimer: Also buying 3k worth of shares of GME because obviously I like Stock

So basically, with GME running its course of Round 2ing to the moon. I am buying some share 3k worth of shares if it hits 300, but that is not what this is about. This is about where I shall be in 5 years.

Yes I am autistic, but I shall be one that is successful, being inspired by GME, I shall also transition from a lazy sitting on my ass kind of ape to one that is a titan of the Financial world. My goal in all of this, is to one day be invited on to Jim Loser's show, and on live television call out his shit.

That's right apes, I shall be rich asf and still be an autistic ape. I shall reach the level of rich, that I can call the robbing the hood CEO's little boys with chump change and clown them on a regular basis.

TLDR: I have been inspired by GME to become rich asf, and call out JIM LOSer on his show. GME and my fortune to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",GME TO the moon As Well As my Fortuna 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,1.0,1615402926,thegamingmt
