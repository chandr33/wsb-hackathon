6,lwzwxd,"Everyone loves GME and owns some, that's granted. But not everyone gets the whole silver thing yet. It's the original money. And its great for a savings because its volatility is low. 

But some people want to add some liquidity to their physical silver assets, so they can tie up more of their savings into silver, instead of holding fiat which may continue to experience inflation.  

That's where GameStop brand silver ATM machines come into play. GameStop stock is going to the moon regardless, and needs some kind of new shtick to stay relevant. Imagine an ATM machine that buys silver 1oz coins at spot price and sells them for enough of a premium to keep the machines running.

This will liquify silver, the original money, and should steer us toward eliminating fiat. Physical silver becomes the new savings and cash, and both it and GME go to moontown. I think it's coming, eventually.  Thanks to the subreddit and please I hope you don't ban me again, I'm not talking about SLV, that's a scam.

22,lwzydi,"In the Middle East and surrounding MENA region, similarly to the rest of the world, there is a huge rising popularity in Music Streaming. While Spotify is slowly becoming the monopoly in this sector in the Western world, this app has its own little field, in that it tailors specifically to Middle Eastern/Arabic listeners and artists.

Anghami has been recently acquired and is planned to IPO on the NASDAQ in 2021, making it the first Arab Tech Company to be traded on the NASDAQ.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*User Breakdown\***

Anghami Currently has 70 million active users. Compared to their 2019 Q1 user base, which was 21 million at the time, that is a **233%** increase. ( [Anghami](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/03/2186096/0/en/Anghami-the-leading-music-streaming-platform-in-the-Middle-East-and-North-Africa-to-merge-with-Vistas-Media-Acquisition-Company-Inc-to-become-first-Arab-technology-company-to-list-.html) )

For contrast, in this same time frame Spotify went from 160 Million active users to 286 active users, a 78% increase. ( [Spotify](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/#:~:text=during%20Q3%202018-,Spotify%20User%20Statistics,Premium%20subscribers%20in%20Q4%202019) )

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Recent acquisition\***

Just very recently, it was announced that acquisition company 'Vistas Media Capital', alongside SHUAAInvestment Banking (a UAE based asset management and investment firm), have both committed $40 Million ($30 Million = Vistas, $20Million = SHUAAInvestment ) to effectively merge Anghami with Vistas Media Capital.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Vistas Media Capital \***

The blank check company IPO'd last August, with an initial pricing of $10 and a volume of 10M. I can't find much on previous activities of this company prior to, or even after the IPO, beyond this merger it does not seem like they have done much.

Here's the company mission statement

'**Vistas Media Acquisition Company Inc. (NASDAQ:VMACU) (‚ÄúVMAC‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities in the Global Media and Entertainment sector. The Company intends to identify a target business in the Global Media &amp; Entertainment sector. '**

Past their IPO, they kept trading sideways at around $10 with occasional dips and peaks, hitting a 52W low at 9.91 and a high of 12.55. ( [VMACU](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/vmacu?mod=mw_quote_tab) , [Vistas Media Acquisition](https://vmac.media/) )

&amp;#x200B;

**\*SHUAACapital\***

This is where things get a bit fucky from my end due to this being the UAE market and in Dirham, the local currency there. I tried my best to synthesize what little information I could find and come to some sort of conclusion on them.

First off, SHUAA:

**'is a United Arab Emirates-based company engaged in the provision of financial and investment services. The Company is organized into five segments: the Asset Management segment manages conventional equity, debt and money market, as well as Shariah compliant portfolios and investment funds using both active and passive management styles; the Investment banking segment provides corporate finance advisory, private placements, public offerings of equity and debt securities, among others; the Brokerage segment operates under the brand of SHUAA Securities and acts as principal and agent, providing custody and clearing services to clients, providing access to regional exchanges'**

Some interesting figures and news pertaining to SHUAACapital, [they were up 200% in profits in 2019-2020 ](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/corporate/shuaas-2020-net-profit-surges-166-to-dh125m), and they [Won two awards 'Asset Management Company of The Year' and 'Best Investment Bank in MENA'](https://www.albawaba.com/business/pr/shuaa-capital-secures-two-awards-back-strong-2020-1412362) . Not sure who's giving out these awards but, hey! Good for SHUAA! Publicity is publicity.

As I mentioned, they are far better established than VMACU, already trading on the Dubai Financial Market for the past 21 years. It's essentially a penny stock, with a high of 1.8 AED (0.51 USD) and currently trading sideways at around 0.6 AED (0.17 USD) . ( [SHUAA Capital Investor Relations](https://www.shuaa.com/investor-relations/) , [$SHUAA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SHUAA:UH) )

(btw: I joined SHUAACapital even though they are two seperate words, just so the automod doesn't freak over the penny stock mention)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*My Moves\***

So, even though the acquisition isn't by catalysts big enough to singlehandedly cause a stir, I am still very bullish simply due to the hold Anghami has in that sector.

Some 'westernized' middle easterners may use Spotify or other similar services, but what you need to know is the biggest market to hit on is not the same demographic as a Middle Eastern reddit user. To expand on this: Across Various 'social circles' in the Middle East and surrounding countries the technology and platforms used also vary significantly.

More specifically, for example, a kid from Egypt that went to a private school and talks English with his friends and mainly listens to rap and not Egyptian music is not the demographic, but he is also not the majority in these locales. 

The majority is public schooled people, who are not as westernized and mainly listen to Egyptian for the sake of our example, and similar music from the surrounding culture. This exact market is what Anghami has completely nailed. None of the people who purely want to listen to their regional artists and music will go to any other platform than Anghami. As a person with a Middle Eastern Background, trust me this app is the one taking over in this field. Kind of similar to how Jumia is also taking over the online ordering market by sculpting their services for the areas in which they are offered. 

I would not be surprised if some low-grade mobile companies team up and have it as a default app for phones sold in this region. Generally just lots of potential and the team behind the main app has been very good in stimulating growth.

They are looking to IPO in late Q2 of 2021, and in my opinion they can only really go up from there. Interested to hear everyone else's thoughts.

Or this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

[Good earnings](https://preview.redd.it/pv5100irkuk61.png?width=261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c0f586cef54a26bcb027aa1488dd33cdeb2b37)

# So what are we expecting.... 

* Street is saying .11 EPS. I am hoping for a beat. 20-30 cents is my expectation.
* Revenue is estimated @ \~ 196M, I am expecting somewhere close to that. I would be happily surprised if they could break 200M just because they didn't bring on any new machines in Q4.
* **PURPLE just Partnered with rooms 2 go. I haven't seen a press release on this but this is big news. My understanding is that this has 200 or so locations and they are one of the most aggressive mattress sellers in the nation.**
* **Anecdotal comments from people in the industry say purple is similar to tempur-pedic in the way people ask about and know the branding. People on reddit from Denver Mattress, Mattress firm and Raymour Flannigan have all messaged me on Reddit to say purple is a good product with excellent branding.**

# What are the headlines going to say?

* In the past, headlines have been terrible but numbers have been good, due to some accounting accruals that nearly always worked against us. In Q4 all of the warrant accruals dissappeared because the warrants causing the accruals were redeemed.
* I am expecting GAAP earnings to be really really good and the automated headlines to be extremely favorable. u/lurkingsince2006 and u/indonesian_activist went back and forth last time and there were lots of unknowns, I believe this time they can both agree the warrant accrual is going to be massively favorable from a GAAP standpoint. The adjusted earnings will be the wild card. I still expect these to be good and I'm hoping for 20-30 cents per share.
   * **I expect the reversal will be around 50M+ but I would like the two Math guys mentioned above to confirm.**
* Analysts recently upgraded PRPL's earnings per share to 1.20+ for 2021. That is a big deal as all previous estimates that I recall were negative for 2-3 years to come. This is the inflection point of profitability.

# Continued Growth and future outlook

* We are likely finally going to have years of profitability going forward. Joe Megibow indicated 2021 was going to be a year of 12.5%-15% Net earnings.
* I am optimistic that Joe comments on the new factory opening
* I am optimistic that guidance will be around 875M and I am confident that they can beat that.
   * Each machine is capable of \~100M of revenue and they will likely have 9 running by Aprilish.
* Craig Phillips and Joe have already commented that PRPL will be looking for their 3rd factory towards the end of 2021 and Factory 2 would be fully built out by late 2021, early 2022.
* 2022 starting capacity will likely be 1.1B+ based on 2021 machines
* Purple hasn't even begun expanding outside of the USA, save for 300 canadian stores that were expanded in late 2020.
* I am hoping we get some sort of long term outlook, maybe something along the lines of sustained 30%+ growth for 3-5 years.

# The Timing of the call is Bullish

* This is purples second time ever having the call pre market, the first time was when they upgraded their 2019 guidance. I could be over analyzing this.... so take it with a grain of salt.
* All automated estimates assumed the call would be March 10th, Purple has pulled that in by 1 week.

# The Risks

* I am not an accountant and the last call had some weird Tax receivable agreement- u/indonesian_activist understands it better. I have not been able to find a lot of info on this.
   * If he gets this I'd like his take.
* The Macro environment..... No explanation needed here
* The lack of guidance- this is what has killed us on the last couple of calls. Silence is terrible.
* I've been wrong about Purple before. See the great NRPLING of 2020...
* Q4 is promotional in nature, so their Gross Margins may have seen pressure. I believe this is a risk. 
* Web traffic has decreased the last 40 days, I am not sure why, I'm hoping it's because they are flexing into more wholesalt.

# The plays(Conservative) - Sell puts, Debit Spreads and shares.

This is my current moves, I don't expect you guys to follow. This is just my gut feeling on PRPL. This isn't going to double overnight but it could move 15% or more either way.

&amp;#x200B;

If you followed the previous plays and don't feel comfortable going into earnings then now is the time to leave. If you don't mind holding some shares in the event of a miss, then join me on this adventure.

This is a little story about how maple-syrup canaderaians and grumpy grampus grunge Orgonians teamed up to give everyone a hard wood boning. 

Lumber is going up. Just look around. All the hammer bangin' boomers are squelching about it in the Home Depot. Complain - ""Why's this wood so expensive, I can't afford my new deck, lumber is causing home prices to go up, blah blah blah.""  

So I looked into it. 

Here's the sexy skinny on the wood ·ïï( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)·ïó aw ya. 

First off, the price of lumber is at an all-time high. 

[Wood going nuts!](https://preview.redd.it/ge06b58vluk61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4117ba347db15123e3c9484b508ceb2f3019c50f)

Third, housing starts are still below 2005 highs and continue to go up with cheap interest rates and stimmy money.

I HEAR YOU. I HEARD YOU. STOP. 

bUt WhY iS wOoD iN fOrEsT cHeAP? It's because all the Maple licking tree suckling Canadananas are so damn good at chopping and licking tree syrup that they bought up all the North American Lumber Mills. (see cite 1 &amp; 2).

If I have the only the Lays Potato crunchy goodness factory in the world, and you and all the other poors have all the potaters, I'm gonna screw you and get the taders for nothing and sell them for a mountain of gold to all the hungries and fatties of the world. 

This is much like what is happening. Mill owners have a quasi-monopoly and have decided to screw over all the tree farmers (..... tree farmers, like common get a job).  Tree farmers = sad, but have no way to make $$$ other than tree. So Tree man sell tree to greedy mill monopoly. 

House Builder man doesn't GAF about what it costsi to make a house so long as bag holder billy will buy it with super low interest rates allowing his pizza hizzle job to afford a $5m home in the suburbs. (btw wood is a MAJOR KEY CRITICAL SUPER IMPORTANT ingredient of a house). 

So TA DA. Here comes  Weyerhaeuser Co. ($WY) a 100 yr old grampy grumpus company stock who doesnt like to do anything but saw trees in Oregon and lay hard wood while listening to old grungy bullshit music. Old grumpy WeyerHouwhatever ($WY) looks up from his wood nap, and all he sees are maple-sucking-carpet-bagging-tree-buggering-really-pleasant-canadananans. So what does he do, he gets Trump to ban their horseshit ass wood with terriffs and cranks up the mills. 

BUT THEN GRAMPUS DECIDES. WHY NOT GET RICH WITH THOSE DIRTY CANADERANANS. So they have a secret meeting. Deep in the black forest of Valheim. Where much wood is stroked, and the fires of monopoly are stoked.

66,lx02s0,"So y'all need to seriously check out Purple mattress. Not just the stock, but the actual mattress. Let me just tell you my experience.   


I needed a new bed and I liked their youtube ads. Plus their technology is very innovative. They invented and own this Hyper-Elastic Polymer so literally no other company has this. I placed the order for the bed, frame, pillows, sheets, etc. The whole thing. I cannot even begin to describe what it was like. The moment I felt the bed I knew I was in some future shit. The best way I can describe it, is it feels like a super supportive yet squishy and soft cloud. It's not like a memory foam AT ALL. It's squishy but springs back immediately. My 3 year old jumps on it like a little trampoline because it's so springy. Sleeping on it is the most comfortable experience I've ever had. After I felt the bed I knew I had to have more Purple in my life. I bought a seat cushion and back support next for my office chair. Again, life changing. Then I realized I was a horrible father if I didn't give my son the same experience so I bought a full bed, sheet, pillow set again for him. The sheets and pillows are honestly as amazing as the mattress.   


Now the stock. I realized that this company basically has no real competition because no one else has access to this Hyper-Elastic Polymer. Other mattress companies have their own tech but there is simply just nothing else out there like this. On top of that the stock has been a clear winner since IPO and just continues to go up. Earnings are tomorrow and were just upgraded to being even more positive than originally thought. See this article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surprise-coming-purple-prpl-earnings-142702272.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surprise-coming-purple-prpl-earnings-142702272.html)  


People have been at home and in bed more than ever. People are getting tax returns and stimulus checks which is the biggest mattress purchasing time of year. I am hearing more and more people in my life talk about Purple lately. When I mention I bought one of their beds nearly everyone I tell says, ""Oh, I've heard of them. Those look cool. Is it as nice as they say?"" This tells me that their ad campaigns are working. Everyone I know has at least heard of them and they are also now getting contracts with brick and mortar stores so people can try them out in person. I'm telling you that if someone tries it, they will buy it.   


So that's my DD. Mostly personal experience but if you look into the company their financials are as solid as their polymer is squishy. I now have 40% of my portfolio in them. Do yourselves a favor and buy the stock then with the earnings buy the damn bed too. You'll thank me later.",Purple Mattress PRPL! The future of mattresses!,0.38,1614794314,dema9o9ue

74,lx03ng,"Greetings children,

I would like to introduce you to $LEG is has broken a critical resistance and with this level be broken by buyers we can head up to 60 in the following days.

The reason why this breakout is so significant is because it is on the weekly which means it can really keep on running, as they say, the bigger the base, the bigger the breakout!

I have really high hopes on this one and I have put my entire lifesaving into it, chart will be posted below, it has broken out out of a 2 year base! Imagine the breakout after this consolidation

**My position 350x 3/19 50c**

How I am playing this, since it broke out I have my stop loss right at the pennant, so if it falls back in I get stopped out. I got in when the move was already in action, but I think we will see continuation because it is a weekly breakout. (I am not financial advisor, not financial advice)
