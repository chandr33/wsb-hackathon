11,m29dac,"I'm not familiar with pharmaceuticals, so I've decided to invest in them blindly.  

My first bet is on ACAD.

On Tuesday, ACAD stocked dropped by nearly 50% after one of their products was denied by the FDA.  I understand that the product was denied due to a labelling issue, which I assume would be easy enough to resolve.  My gut tells me that the market overreacted to the FDA news, and the stock price is too low.

I got in this morning at $25 per share.  Prices rose to about $29 per share earlier today ($26.5 now), but I'm convinced the stock price will return to $50 once this FDA issue is corrected.

Anyone else bullish on ACAD?  Am I oversimplifying this FDA issue?  Can prices return to $50 levels?",Rolling the Dice 🎲 ACAD,1.0,1615412198,csedev

After comparing GME's (among other meme stocks) dip corresponding to the huge open for RBLX, we have the following:
Time | Volume | Average Price | $$$
12:22 | 850752 | -316.345 | $(269,131,141.44)
12:23 | 62464 | -302.68 | $(18,906,603.52)

12:29 | 710560 |281 | $199,667,360.00 
12:30 | 822292 |-266.335 | $(219,005,139.82)
12:35 | 356774 |-236.02 | $(84,205,799.48)
12:36 | 727942 |-230.05 | $(167,463,057.10)
12:41 | 827428 |-185 | $(153,074,180.00)
Total | $(1,153,629,996.41)

Similarly for AMC on the 5minute interval because I’m lazy and retarded = $(247,557,552.81)
For RBLX = $4,001,005,010.80 
That’s a delta of about 2.6 billion. If I wasn’t so retarded and lazy I would do the rest of the meme stocks and I bet that delta comes down to a more reasonable level.

Now looking at a random ass comparison (googled big video game ipo’s) to the ZNGA ipo in 2011:
The entire first day of trading ended in about a $1.1 billion change in market cap. In the day and age of WSB and the media coverage, I get that there would be more interest in the RBLX ipo, but this seems staggering compared to the first 30 minutes of RBLX.

Hypothesis: Some institution(s) with a diversified memefolio thought all of the conversations on WSB regarding the RBLX ipo would mean we would all be switching. They tried to lead the switch by being first out/first in.

Conclusion: Too bad there is no we and I am a giant fucking retard. Suck these diamond balls. I’ll invest in RBLX sometime after GME price hits $420,000.69.",How the GME dip may be related to RBLX,1.0,1615412208,clic45

As you look through today’s chart I am sure you noticed the Ottoman Empire sized dip that took place. It’s hard to miss. 

Did the hedgies fuck us like my wife’s boyfriends fucks her? No from what I understand he is an adequate lover and the hedgies grow more pathetic by the day. What they do not seem to understand is we are unfucked and unfuckable, we are diamond handed apes jacked the fuck up on a biker crank combo of bananas, crayons, and rocket fuel.

I heard a quote today that resonated with me and I want to share it with you. 

“ I WILL NEVER SELL, SUCK MY DICK. BUY HIGH SELL HIGHER. BANANA BANANA BANANA CRAYON BANANA”

~ Warren Buffet ( I think )

Now to my olive branch, you Euro Apes have performed exceptionally well this week but we need you now more than ever. In my experience if you give someone an offer they cannot refuse they are forced to accept do to the lack of an alternative. I offer this as a top 5 Jew Ape. I will give you a moment to mumble an anti Semitic slur of your choosing. If you can get us back to 300 at open tomorrow on behalf of the Jews I will officially forgive you for the Holocaust.

TLDR: Remember apes, even though GME is now on Short Sale Restriction they can still short the stock on an uptick! Stay strong, ignore the fuckery and hold the line! 

——

Usually the hedgies can short a stock at any time they want. Today they had a small, short lived victory and GME dropped more than 10% (how’d that work out for ya Melvin?) which means it has been placed on Short Sale Restriction 

This means that if the price is already going down, they are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, they are allowed to continue their shenanigans.

My thoughts on this is that lunchtime today was a test.

If they’re sat on the shorts that have gone from iBorrowDesk, then tomorrow they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left. 

Now if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell, driving the price lower and hitting stop losses continuing the drop.

If I was a Melvin, and I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up until I ran out of ammo. I would probably even let it spike to scare people into thinking that the top has been hit.

This could be an especially effective tactic for them if people don’t realise that Short Sale Restriction does not stop them from shorting completely!

Ape may be retarded, but ape not dumb. Ignore the bullshit that is bound to unfold over the next 24/48 hours. If you have read the DD and been following this for a while, you know just how fucked they are. 

Hold strong brothers and sisters, moon awaits!

TLDR: don’t sell, hold, buy more if you can. Not financial advice. Obligatory emojis.

Looking at option chains for 3/12 expiration.  Here’s the scoop: current ITM options at today’s price of $260 is 32,972 contracts. If price goes to $300 by Friday there will be 91,122 contracts ITM. 

Make sure you are sitting down.

If we get to $500 on Friday there are bother 94k contracts that come ITM. Total contracts go to 18,548,700 shares that need to be covered and the gamma squeezes harder. Don’t get scared by shills, bots and news hype. Just HODL.
