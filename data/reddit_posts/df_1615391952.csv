11,m20rmp,"This isn't a ""OMG LETS GO GME"" or a ""you guys are dumb apes"", etc post.

I just want to say that I've been wanting to jump into stocks for a long time now, but I hate losing money. But I also know there's money to be made in stocks. It's just the risk of losing ANY amount that has made me very hesitant.

I hesitated to pull the trigger on digital currency back in 2017 when it was just a couple of hundred and before it reached its ""peak"" at $16,000. I was hesitant to invest in Tesla when it was just a couple of bucks, and many other stocks.

I have a steady income and a comfortable life now, I'm able to have some money to play with, where it won't hurt too bad. I grew some balls, lost a few braincells, grew some hair on my chest and 2 hairs on my left nut. I found this subreddit and wanted to join a community that was as stupid as I was. Since then, I took the gamble on GME. I took it as a chance to jump in the game to fund my investment account and start my portfolio.

I wasn't looking to become rich off of GME, and I'm not going to. I made some gains, but not enough to post. I just wanted to start somewhere. I needed to surround myself with people more stupid than I and help me get to their level of stupidity. Idk if I'm quite the autist yet, but I hope to reach that level next.

BTW, I'm still hodling and not selling until we're on the moon. I've diamond handed from the start and feel bad for those who have longer playtime in stocks and paper handed. Ok ok, I really don't feel bad for them, fuck'em.",Thanks for helping me grow some balls WSB!!!,1.0,1615392042,leo98918

32,m20tjm,"hi guys,

It took me some time to find a [good quality chart](https://www.investing.com/equities/dryships-chart) for this historical squeeze that took place in 2007, and I did not manage to find detailed information about how it happened (maybe a fellow ape could shed some light on this), but from the information I have collected , here is the bottom line :

This squeeze was the first of two squeezes this company had (2007 and 2016), the price before the squeeze was about 5$ per share, and it peaked around **1.483 Billion dollars per share..** as you can see, the squeeze lasted quite some time before it sold off, which would really a good thing if it goes down like this for Gme.

42,m20typ,"okej. let's make easy calculation . last monday we get close to 45%+ and we had 35,000 calls . 

monday 15.03 we have fro now 45,000 calls. (lest calculate to that number, but remember that i should go bit higher) --&gt; 45,000 is 128% of 35,000. 

So 45 \* 128% is 57.  

That means 15.03 we can see 57% + without retails hype!!

300 +57% is = $471. without HYPE!

But 2021-03-22 monday we have    62,779 calls for current price( lets calculate it to that price even if it should get 471) 62, 000 is 177% of 35,000 .

So 45% \*177% is 79,5.

That means that 22.03 we can see 79,5%+ without retails hype!!

471+ 79,5% = $845 WITHOUT HYPE and retails buying in others days!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

And magic is just starting cuz $845  number from only calls, and it dont include retails buying . That mean we have to add to that number short squeeze !",Simple DD calculation for people who thinks it can' get 10000,1.0,1615392209,shiew1111

99,m20zhf,"Hello folks, 

**Muddy Waters Research, a prominent short-seller, is shorting XL Fleet.** They were on CNBC this morning, officially stating they have a short position with XL. They are, of course, a bunch of di\*\*\* who want the retail investors to lose while they make a boat-load of money. I want them to be forced to cover ASAP. 

**XL Background:**

XL Fleet was founded in 2009 by Tod Hynes, an MIT graduate. They convert motorized vehicles into one of two configurations: 

\- XL Hybrid -  25% MPG improvement, 20% CO2 reduction 

\- XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO2 reduction

Important to note: **they currently are developing full-electric conversions of fleets**, which will improve their revenues greatly once completely developed. 

They also develop and implement EV charging stations. XL currently has the largest charging station deal in U.S. history - they are implementing 1,000 EV charging stations in New York City at UBS Arena (NYI rink). The CEO also stated they have a number of other deals like this in the works just a week ago. 

They have a blue-chip consumer base, including **Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Canada Post, Verizon, FedEx**, and much more!

Some significant shareholders include Blackrock, JP Morgan, and Hudson Bay Capital. 

The current price-targets range from 30-58, that implies a 2.5-5x return from its current levels ($11.90). 

There revenues are expected to grow over 100% every year to 2024. Particularly, there **2024E revenue is $1.4B**. The company currently has $**400M in cash on-hand**, which gives them lots of cash to help in there endeavour to grow significantly. 

IMO: **a short-squeeze is imminent**, and we are gonna make those losers over at Muddy Waters cover their short position before the weeks out.
