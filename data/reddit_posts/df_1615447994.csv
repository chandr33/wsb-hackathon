11,m2krpu,"Disclaimer: Before I say anything, please know: I am very retarded. I do not own any Tesla shares; I merely own a Tesla and am a tech enthusiast. These are **my own observations and my own opinions**, not taken from any sources or market trends. Another thing: this is **not** a stock DD, merely a company one, but it does have implications for the stock.

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about Tesla and Apple and couldn't help but notice just how similar the trends in their practices are. Let's take a closer look at what exactly they do similarly.

**Broadly speaking, while many other companies base decisions off of current consumer wants, Tesla &amp; Apple dictate their decisions based on their own vision of simplicity**. This generally means that the decisions they make are more geared towards their vision without too much regard for the consumer. On Apple's side: 

1. They took away the headphone jack from their iPhones in 2016. Sure, there were valid reasons (saving space on the inside), but this pissed a lot of people off. In the end, we saw that this decision was a way to promote their Airpods and further their version of a minimalist future. And guess what? Not long after, all other companies took away the headphone jack too.
2. They removed the charger from the box of the iPhones in 2020. Once again, an anti-consumer decision. Whether or not this decision ""saves the environment"" or not isn't something I want to debate, but we just know this further contributes to their minimalist vision. Again, Samsung and Xiaomi followed and took away the charger from their box as well.
3. They took away the standard USB ports from their 2016 and later Macbooks, opting for USB C. Who the hell used USB C in 2016? Nonetheless, this decision made the computer more minimalistic and simple; in fact, five years after that transition, USB C seems to be the way to go for most laptops nowadays.

Like Apple, Tesla has made a number of decisions that are controversial, and their new 2021 Model S lineup seems to further support this idea:

1. The 2016/17 Tesla refreshes dramatically simplified their vehicles in the name of simplicity. For one, the Model 3 had automatic windshields, headlights, and even braking (you very rarely have to press on the brakes ever since regenerative braking automatically stopped the car fully). These were not that controversial, but the windshield one seemed odd. To control the windshields manually, one had to enter the Tesla menu and change it there rather than having a windshield stock like all cars did at the time.
2. The 2021 Tesla Model S refresh made a number of ""anti-consumer"" decisions much like those of Apple. For one, the yoke steering wheel seems to serve NO practical purpose other than put drivers at risk. It is rumored that there will be no D/N/R gear stock, meaning the car AUTOMATICALLY decides which gear you should be driving in based on your surroundings (ex: if you're in a parking spot and there's something in front of you, it will automatically put the car in reverse). Like, who asked for this? No one, but anything to serve their minimalist vision I guess.

Another aspect of simplicity is the release timeline and refresh of models. To accurately illustrate this point I'll compare them with other companies. Let's start with Apple:

\- Releases only a few new phone models per year. In the past, there was just **one iPhone per year**. This year there was the iPhone 12 mini, 12, 12 pro, and 12 pro max. It sounds like a lot, but compared to Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi (the three biggest Android phone makers) it's nothing. Of course, they have their main S20/S20+/S20 Ultra/Note 20/Note 20 Ultra, but Samsung also has their S20 FE, M41, A51, A71, A71 5G, A51 5G, and the list just goes on and on. Yes, there are even considerable differences in the 5G versions of each phone, such as having different chipsets and thus different performance *(Source:* [*GSM Arena Samsung*](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung-phones-9.php)*)*. You can look at the GSM Arena smartphones for Huawei and Xiaomi and the lists are equally long.

\- When Apple makes decisions, they stick with them for a long time. The home button iPhone models with the &lt;4 inch screens (2007 iPhone —&gt; 2013 iPhone 5) had very similar designs. What's more, the 2014 iPhone 6 —&gt; 2017 iPhone 8 had **indistinguishable** designs. They had identical screen sizes, resolutions, and the exteriors looked exactly the same. The same applies for the notch at the top of the screen. Since the 2017 iPhone X the notch design has barely changed even after four release cycles (X, XS, 11, 12). For comparison, take a look at Samsung's main S lineup: S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21. **Every single year the phone looks considerably different**. This is not a good or bad thing, but just an observation.

Ok this post is getting super long but bear with me here. Tesla is no different from Apple in these release cycles and to show that I'll compare it to some companies.

\- **Tesla only has five models** (one unreleased): **S, 3, X, Y, Roadster** (tehcnically). The models are **only refreshed every four years or so**. In 2016, the Model S was refreshed for the first time since 2012, getting a slightly sleeker design and some interior changes. Again, this Model S held until 2021, where the model is undergoing changes for the first time in five years. Let's look at how many models **Toyota**, one of the biggest car brands in the world has: Corolla, Yaris, Prius, Avalon, Camry, RAV4, RAV4 EV, C-HR, Land Cruiser, Supra, 86, Mirai, Tacoma, and the list goes on forever *(Source:* [Google–Toyota Cars](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=toyota+car+models)*)*. Each of these models goes through a refresh cycle quicker than every four years like Tesla, and a lot of stuff is changed (not just a minor front cosmetic refresh like the Tesla Model S).

What does this all mean for the consumer? It means two things, good and bad:

1. **They have less choices to make.** The consumer's buying decision is much easier. If they want an iPhone, they only have so many choices. If they want a Tesla Sedan, there aren't 20 different choices like one would face buying a Toyota.
2. **On the flip side, the consumer is subject to the choices, good and bad, of the company**. Whenever Apple or Tesla make a bad decision, the consumer has to go along with that decision if they want to stay with the company. When Apple switched their **entire laptop lineup** to USB C, or when they removed the headphone jack from **all of their phones**, consumers had to deal with that if they wanted an iPhone. If that individual instead had a Samsung phone, they have a ton of other phones to choose from, many of which retain the headphone jack (of course, a buying decision is more complicated than whether or not there's a headphone jack. this is just an example).

Lastly, ***what does this mean for Tesla's future?***

Here is one potential way this all could play out based on Apple's position in the market:

1. In the next five years, Tesla will be all the talk the same way the iPhone was everything in the first few years of its launch. No other company had done what Apple had done with the phone then, so they played catchup in this period.
2. By **2025–2030**, a number of companies will have exceeded Tesla's EV in different ways. Some might have much better performance (faster 0–60s, higher HP, etc.) for better prices, or longer range. The analogy of this is in 2014 and 2015 when Android phones began to cost less than iPhone with better specs.
3. In 10+ years when the EV market matures, Tesla will still be a market leader but likely in the same way that Apple is a ""market leader"". While not being majority percentage of the automobile market Tesla will still be one of the biggest players (the same way Apple currently holds 9% market share in computers with macOS and 27% of the global phone market).

Once again, I'm a retard. There will be things you disagree with and maybe things that are out-right incorrect, but I hope you took away something based on the general premise of the post.

tl;dr: Main reasons for why Apple and Tesla are similar:

1. Apple and Tesla make decisions to advance their ultimate vision of simplicity, not thinking about the consumer first (Apple removing iPhone headphone jack in 2016, removing iPhone charger in 2020, Tesla's yoke steering wheel 2021 + automatic gear shifting)
2. Similar to 1, but their lineup advances this vision of simplicity to make the consumer's decision easier (Only a few new iPhones each year compared to other phone companies, Tesla only has four current car models)

Prediction of Tesla's future: While for the first few years they will be the dominating EV maker, companies will start to catch up in 2025–2030 and have ""headline features"" (ex: longer range, better performance, more software quirks). After 10 ish years of EV market maturing, competition will continue to be fierce and push the boundaries of innovation but Tesla will still have a considerable stake in the market (between 10% and 30%).",Tesla vs. Apple Company Trends DD,1.0,1615448293,root3over2
12,m2krx5,"The biggest story this month in mainstream finance media was the sudden spike in the interest rate for 10 year US government bonds and the effect it was having on the stock market. In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we’ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

[Ray Dalio’s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

&amp;#x200B;

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/f7l7k2juqcm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5219d3117e75631efc1f89889f96fb8793dbb130)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/6jf845eyqcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fedb9bc370aabc91a61d646a92c727a7af85268b)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝****?*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/xq06xb62rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df5e0dac578200ea080a19ac6ea15668f654cff8)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/nr0aw865rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddda8ff13e7ec59d0cfb7af48269055bf501fd4)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

&amp;#x200B;

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/d2fwbnj6rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f539d25b46ec18137ccfda02a888df4ec3ff7b7)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, centered around 2018](https://preview.redd.it/q5sch5nkrcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6fd64791d780a7aea9bec6202e3f565881aac14)

[Fed Funds Rate around 2018](https://preview.redd.it/wk5ckb1lrcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62653d7d216fa4ae5e1277c82b83396b3f917d31)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go 📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

18,m2ktda,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible with a little background since it’s a specific circumstance and you guys are idiots with short attention spans. My Mom is a Financial Advisor of 25+ years and has raised me to invest, buy and hold, diversify, etc. She doesn’t buy individual stocks and only invests in Mutual Funds and ETF’s mostly because my Mom and Dad’s age (65/60) and risk level. This is fine for her since she has been buying since the 1970’s herself. I always had her put me in Science and Technology and it literally paid for my entire college tuition.

I am now 26 and working from home. I work in Sales for a TV sports network and make $80,000/yr. I have a stable income. I am obviously much riskier than my Mom and currently have $54,000 in shares of extremely high risk, volatile stocks (TTD, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, ABNB, FSLY, PINS, FB, PYPL, SE, SHOP, SQ, MELI, DDOG, ARKK) and around 25 more tech, e-commerce, and infrastructure stocks. The problem is, I had saved $30,000 the past year and bought a lot of tech last Monday. Needless to say it got bumpy and my Mom offered me a deal when my account got to $48,000 (down 16% in 2 days along with you retards LFG):

Now for the advice - and please, no serious replies:

DEAL: Guaranteed $61,000 original investment if I do not invest any more money this year and simply hold investments of some kind until the end of the year. IF they are above $61,000 at the end of 2021, we will split any profits 50/50. 

I am looking to buy a house the beginning of 2022 so this is a 6-9 month window. What stocks would you invest in for the remainder of 2021? Would you be extremely risky and tech heavy since this money is guaranteed anyways?
I bought a few thousand GME, AMC, TSLA, and BA calls but haven’t done options that much and would want to allocate more than 25% of my portfolio in them. How would you divvy this up, fellow HODLers?",ADVICE PLEASE... Tell Me How Retarded I Should Be,1.0,1615448476,Kajavee

And spending a whole lot of it there as my as a Europoor giving back and saying thanks too the Americ*nts and their financial system  🙌🏻

2. The memes, humor and positivity.
3. The community.
4. The potential transfer of wealth.

5. Us coming together from all over the world, talking too each other like trash out of pure love ❤️ 

6. The amount of financial education all this has given the retail market-participants.


Things i dont like:

1. The greedy 1% holding most of the wealth ( except for examples like Musk, Gates and partially Buffet. Who either make or spend a large portion of their money on things that potentially could impact and benefit the world and humanity as a whole )

2. The mainstream media colluding and trying to move and influence the masses into financial or political decisions ( this is really bad right now and is one of the largest reasons of past civil wars )

3. The widespread unfairness between the different “types” of market participants.


I personally does not have a lot of shares, currently holding 13 GME and 17 AMC as of mars 11.

67,m2lbdz,"So I know a guy who invented a time machine of sorts.; so clearly this isn't financial advice, this is a story of the coming days. The word from the machine is, March 9 something kicks off. That's the beginning of a big deal. Given that on March 8, GME shot back to life, and today, March 10th, the hedge funds came out in force, I'd say that date/guess was fairly spot on. I'm also fairly certain GME is THE subject in question, the major incident, the machine has picked up on.

This ""incident"" peaks on March 19 (I'm assuming the big squeeze day), and continues to be a thing through March 24. Been holding/buying since the $300's from the last run-up, but now have tacked on the call options for March.

After March 24, the effects of this ""incident"" are far reaching and last a while, as in, we'll all be dealing with the shockwaves of GME's March madness for about 3 years thereafter. I think it's likely that GME moons like a sonofabitch, like $1000 a share ain't shit, and then the market tanks as a result. That's why there'd be at least 3 years of immediate and ongoing pain surrounding the GME debacle. I'm sure at least, the politicians will go nuts.

Point being, on top of watching GME go up solidly everyday since the 8th, especially today (even with the ladder attacks), the banana light is ON to make ape bets here to wreak maximum profit/havoc on those greedy cheating hedgies. Apes love to buy surely retarded things worth many bananas, especially when they can see the yellow light of bananas etched into their corneas.
