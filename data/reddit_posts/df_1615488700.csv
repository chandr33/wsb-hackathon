12,m2xqbo,"Just my POV:

That FOMO thing is a part of you that really wants the best for you - the biggest gains.  
However, too much greed is not really a good thing while making a bet. If you want your bets to have power, you can learn to control your FOMO power, learn to control yourself. 

Firstly, you need to understand where your FOMO came from - it might have been a glance at your best life from your current perspective. This vision might have been enough for you to screw everything you learned about market, it did not matter at all -  the prize was so big, so you put your finger in a pile of shit without checking the validity of the bet.

Well, now that you admit a bit of what it truly was it, how can you hate yourself for FOMOing? You should hate yourself for being lazy and for hating yourself because of your FOMO! You just learned how to learn what you truly want and what blocks your path - seems to me like it's a lack of money. However, as we used to say, money doesn't grow on tree - right now it needs power to be transfered to another account and those in charge take a lot in between transaction. But you have something they don't steal yet in most of our cases - it's your time use to play games and enjoy life after spending more of your  time on your job. It's also the time you use to better yourself(but I don't believe it's the case on this sub tho). This time is the time you can spend better and learn to spend it even better, just to reach your dreams eventually.

Of course, You only need to give something in exchange, if you really want to straighten your path, and if you do, remember that you should pay big, or else you might get scammed by others who paid more to pay less in future, and many had a lot to pay upfront, yes, the world isn't fair, some are born with only time on the table, some are born even without it.

Anyway, right now, in my opinion, you have two options:

* Hate yourself and promise not to use market or simply cry and wait for next FOMOs then eventually go back to lying to yourself about liking your life if you are not one of few lucky ones.
* Learn a fucking lesson and admit you are a little bit of a puss every day, start to get prepared for your next FOMOs.

Now, let's say you decided not to be a little b&amp;\*ch this time, what could you do? How to direct spending your time?

Well, it's a long term investment - you learn how to learn, then you learn how to learn about market, then you learn about market, you talk with people inside, your read your subs, you read your DDs even if you don't want to invest yet, you are constantly around the things you want to do and you think of what it is that has an impact. Then you learn more on this topic.

Your life could really turn around slowly, step by step, to the path of your perfect vision, the vision you are likely forgetting day by day. FOMO woke up part of it a little. Believe in FOMO. It can do a lot and all you need to do is to be fair with yourself. Do you want your life to be noticably better? Or do you just want to earn big cuz others did? Well shit fam, you real stupid and godluck on your weak ass bet. But if you are willing to put effort for long term happiness, stick around for next FOMO moments, see where you could have bought, what actions would lead you to a loss, have your money saved, but ever panic buy unless you prepared yourself for panic buying.

Remember to be fair with yourself before and make a solid decission whenever you get a first big impulse.  If you did not prepare well - forget about your FOMO until tomorrow. Yes, you could've earned, but most likely you would've lost again, this world works better if your decissions are critical. Wake up fine the next day then use your pastFOMO frustration of missing out(also FOMO) to prepare for a next dive.

This way I don't lose anymore on a first step. I realise there's many more to come, but my first FOMO losses from month ago did keep my around firmly and I do not intend to sell for small numbers. I lost my cash when I FOMO'ed month or so ago, right now all I have are stonks, not money, I accepted my ""loss"" so I can only win if I invest my time along with it, as I don't only consider money a prize. Hodling has no bad outcome from my current POV and I really like this mindset. 

Goodluck to you all!

PS: This sub might want all the best for its apes, but not everyone can just simply join the club. Be realistic - perhaps we are not retarded enough to easily get rich on completely out of blue YOLOs, like some autists here. I think it's because even tho we are all born retarded, the world straightens us too much and makes us forget who we really are. Gain strenght to embrace your retardness, become a part of a thing, not just a FOMO sheep.","To new FOMOers: Don't hate yourself for your FOMO, it's a part of you, make it a steady relationship instead of one peak stand.",1.0,1615488818,That_Geralt

- Tech is oversold and will continue to ride up for the next month or so. Beyond that we'll have to see.

- If you want some technical analysis, Parabolic SAR indicator is bullish for INTC.

31,m2xrxh,"Empower under short attack - hold your shares!

I just wanted to share the following data with all you guys, who might be in doubt since the share price has tanked so hard over the last weeks:  


[Short positions for Empower Clinics. Source: https:\/\/shortdata.ca\/largest-short-positions\/ \(click on tab 'CSE'\)](https://preview.redd.it/drx2otm12fm61.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c9f0bbf1862508d811bac5cc33a0291624ad2f9)

Short positions have increased by more than 40 **million** between mid of February and beginning of March. That's also why bashers flooded the message boards. They try to get inexperienced investors to sell their shares by raising doubt and questioning the business model or even calling everything a pump and dump fake. This actually not very unusual for stocks listed on CSE and after skyrocketing so hard Empower was the perfect aim. Just remember, that Empower partners with big players like Rexall, look at the incredible news flow and be patient. This stock might not make you rich overnight at this point, but in my own personal opinion this is a great long term invest.

WHEN WILL THIS HAPPEN?
- Shorts do NOT have to cover by 19th of March (Quadruple witching). But it will likely be in their best interest to do so b4 the 19th because of the increased volatility which takes place on a quadruple witching day. 
- Importantly, if people keep holding, then the borrow fee and and share price could be high enough to force a considerable number of margin calls and new option calls ending in the money.
- Furthermore, the proposed new DTCC rule would add a great deal of pressure on them, especially if it is acted upon. But no one knows if it will, according to some reports it doesn’t enter into force before circa two months from now.
- The actual price on Ḍ-day will depend largely on whether apes choose to hold their shares and their in-the-money and near-the-money options. If most people hold, then I think we could test and even surpass any expectations. 
- The final peak price on the Short Squeeze day is psychological, it depends on how resilient every individual is in getting to sell for the price he wants, and being stubborn hard enough for it to happen. It also depends on being one ape body that doesn’t flinch. Diamond hands.. is real. 
- I trust that Diamond handed apes and long institutional investors see the potential here, all will hold.

HOW TO DO IT?
Resisting the urge to sell at loss when hedgefunds provoke artificial bull traps. Similarly to how DFV resisted with GME. Explanation:
- When Hedgefunds cover a part of their shorts, like let’s say 1M shares, they allow for a bull run to follow, add to this the FOMO (fear o missin out) and the stock price starts to rise reaching new levels of resistance and establishing new levels of support.
- By covering 1M hedgefunds have freed up some stock to be shorted again for the amount of 1M. 
- Once the stock price has risen significantly, the hedgefunds short the stock again for the amount of 1M and thus the stock price tanks, and (except for diamond hands) retail investors start fudding (fear doubt and uncertainty) and sell at a loss. 
- The stock price breaks below the newly acquired levels of support.
- But this is all artificial. Because hedgefunds still have to cover and to cover at a slightly higher market price IF the majority of investors hold and buy the dip.
- This is going to repeat again and again until it reaches higher and higher price levels until ultimately, hedgefunds have to cover for good. 
- The same reasoning is especially valid when it comes to NOT placing stop loss orders.
- Until then there is no exit strategy needed. Cf. “What is an exit strategy” DFV.

We  all know that Ryan Cohen is now a big part of the Gamestop future.  💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🚀  We   also know that Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy. So let's do some   math. (SMOOTH BRAIN APE JUST KNOW PRICE GO  🚀🚀 ) TL;DR at Bottom.

The Pet industry was a roughly $100 Billion Dollar industry in 2019. (remove Vet Spending and it's **$59 Billion**)

([https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/articles/13660-us-pet-spending-nears-100-billion-in-2019](https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/articles/13660-us-pet-spending-nears-100-billion-in-2019))[https://imgur.com/99vocEZ](https://imgur.com/99vocEZ)

The Gaming industry is a roughly **$60 Billion** in 2020 in the USA.[https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/)[https://imgur.com/fMas5wt](https://imgur.com/fMas5wt)

Chewy has **12,000 employees**

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHWY/chewy/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHWY/chewy/number-of-employees)

Gamestop has **14,000 employees**

[https://imgur.com/VfSIkE4](https://imgur.com/VfSIkE4)

Chewy had **$4.847 Billion in Revenue in 2020.**

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHWY/chewy/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHWY/chewy/revenue)

[https://imgur.com/SLi79hV](https://imgur.com/SLi79hV)

Gamestop had **$6.466 Billion in 2020 Revenue**

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

[https://imgur.com/RTfChix](https://imgur.com/RTfChix)

Chewy has a market cap of **$ 35.69B**

[https://ycharts.com/companies/CHWY/market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/CHWY/market_cap)

Gamestop has a market cap of **$17.85B**

[https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/market_cap)

As a pure apples to oranges comparison, you can see **that revenue and number of employees (aka infrastructure of the company) between Chewy and Gamestop is close.**   Now if you took out the veterinary care of the market size for pets,   you'd see that it is actually about $57Billion. Which is really close to   the $60 Billion of the Video Game market. Since Chewy doesn't compete   in the veterinary space this should be removed from it's calculation.    Looking at how similar the companies are on these fronts, it's odd that  **Gamestop is at HALF THE MARKET CAP!** AKA. **If we valued the potential for Gamestop the same way we value Chewy it would be worth DOUBLE IT'S CURRENT PRICE.**

If   you truly believe Ryan Cohen can turn Gamestop around and into the   online video game specialty retailer that he envisions, it is UNDER   PRICED STILL! On top of this if you think about competitors in the video   game retail arena, you realize that there are NO MAJOR VIDEO GAME ONLY   RETAILERS besides Gamestop (GameFly might be trying to compete now  that  they sell products not just rent. But they did [under $25 million in revenue](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.gamefly_holdings_llc.c04ff26cf1b0dd7e9ba46e1207014416.html)).   Chewy on the other hand is competing with dozens of companies that   specialize in pet products. Plus GameStop has the brand name recognition   from years of being in business, a Pro Rewards membership program with   probably millions of members, and has a massive trend going for it   online currently.

All told, I like the stock. In for 42 shares (the answer to life, the universe and everything).

72,m2xyej,"Hey, I would like to ask for some honest feedback related to developing a Financial Social Network specifically designed to discuss on stocks, perform dd's, understand general sentiment on the market, amongst other ideas I've been bouncing with some colleagues.

The network will naturally come with up-to-date information on all stocks like news, price change, some ML analysis using general models, etc.

You can think of it as a Reddit channel supercharged to specifically talk about stocks, and investment ideas.

Some brokers have APIs to fetch your portfolio info and open positions, so I thought it would be a nice idea to connect your portfolio and have some analysis done to it (low/high risk portfolio, sector distribution, trade frequency, growth overtime, more ML models, etc.). For instance I know about Ameritrade, and Interactive Brokers APIs.

I'm just asking to get some feedback on your thoughts. I know there are somewhat similar alternatives out there already available, but I believe I can hack something better lol.

Feel free to suggest anything (even if you think is a lame idea)!

I would really appreciate constructive feedback!

Thank you so much for your time!",Social Network for Stock Research and Discussion,1.0,1615489350,oscardavidrm

80,m2xzui,"Its 2024, the stock is in free fall again. Palantir is considered dead.

My friends told me it was a bad investment from the start and are annoyed I told them about the stock.

Its 2020, Palantir has its IPO, there is an attraction to the secrecy behind the stock. Nobody really understands what Palantir does yet. I see the price going up all the way to 32$. I don't really understand it but being somewhat retarded I decide to buy the stock.  My friends tell me Im crazy and warn for the tech bubble. I laugh it off and brag as it reaches 35$. The bubble pops and the stock goes in free fall all the way back to 20$. I'm very worried I will lose everything but I do like the stock even if I don't understand it so I decided to HODL. Looks like it didn't pop at all in the end because the stock recovers.

Its mid-2022, the stock market has recovered and Palantir is rising strong to 120$. Tech stocks everywhere are making huge profits. All my friends got into Palantir by now, everyone is talking about the huge rise Palantir had the last year, they seem unstoppable. Tech had known huge growth, and stocks plummet a few months later with a 60% drop. My friends sell to late and had to take a loss. Palantir is worth 40$ again. 

Value stock fans claim they predicted this crash in 2014 and can finally say I told you so. Being as retarded as I am I hodl and refuse to sell.

Its 2023, the stock market somewhat recovered and Palantir is at 150$ now. Everyone is talking about the stock market recovery and my friends buy back in. 

Some large companies claim they have better solutions then Palantir.

Its 2024, Palantir has trouble finding new customers and stockholders get bored.  The stock starts to drop, my friends sell at 65$ and are bragging how clever they were selling with only a 5% loss.

The stock is in free fall again. Palantir is considered dead. My friends told me it was a bad investment from the start and are annoyed I convinced them to buy the stock. I'm just holding.

Its 2026, Palantir is bringing out its SAAS solution. Suddenly every company is using Palantir. Companies that fail to use Palantir see their profits drop fast.

Its 2029. Alternative solutions don't manage to come close to what Palantir does. The stock is growing exponentially and is nearing 1000$. 

Its 2035. Palantir is now at 10.000$ and everyone who got in early is now a millionaire and can live off its dividends. Palantir is as common in a company as Windows once was. Company's that don't use Palantir get competed out of the market.

I have Palantir Foundry now on my watch and phone and use it to help me take every decision I make. Where should I travel to given my interests, what is best for my children to study, and what are the financial consequences if I buy that villa at the sea.

I remain invested and still like the stock.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advise I am not a financial advisor, nor does this reflect reality or future reality, I am just a retard with to much time on my hands who holds a modest 200 shares in Palantir (bought in several times around 22-26$)",What Palantir's future could look like,1.0,1615489444,roadtriptofire
