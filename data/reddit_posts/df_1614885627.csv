73,lxt0bx,"After testing RAVI indicator for about 2 weeks, making mistakes and looking into them, I decided to make an improved, updated guide, so others who discovered this from me won't make the same mistakes that might cost them big ammounts of money. The guide has no attempts at the big funny, and just focuses on being simple ro read

(This is an ***infraday*** indicator for **day trading/scalping**)

So, just like last time, a step by step:

# Which stocks to trade:

Not all stocks work with RAVI. In fact, most probably won't. There are strict requirements to guarantee daily profits - here they are:

1. Volatility. A stock must move in at least a 6-8% daily range on previous days.
2. Volume. A stock must have good, regular ammounts of volume for the majority of the first half of the day. If you see that a stock has abysmal volume yesterday, it's a good idea to not trade it today.
3. Indecisiveness. RAVI is great at predicting when a stock is hitting a floor or a ceiling, so the more ups and downs is has - the better. If a stock is gradually growing non-stop infraday, it damages accuracy of the indicator severely. It would still be mostly accurate, but a risk of a big loss would be looming at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

[Perfect environment for RAVI trades](https://preview.redd.it/n36pf44vu1l61.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32135f842a2e0f6f8f753d8eb1a61a9d4ec68950)

# How to enter:

Once you turn on RAVI indicator (available on etoro charts and Yahoo Finance), make sure to leave the default settings on.

1. The indicator mostly has white lines. Once one of them becomes red or green - it is a signal for entry. Go LONG on red lines, and go SHORT on green lines respectively.
2. Split your money - never go all in on the first candle. My most effective strategy is to split your money in 3 parts. (explained below)
3. Do NOT enter in the first 10 minutes of the market open, no matter the conditions. MArket go ape shit and you never know what to expect, trading RAVI in this time is very risky

(!) If you see a stock with big volume on market open, while yesterday has bad volume in the 2nd half of the day, ignore RAVI for 30-40 minutes

(!) If the opening price has made a big jump since yesterday's close, ignore it for 30-40 minutes as well. Do not stack the ignoring periods.

(!) On the RAVI indicator you can see two thresholds, usually a 3 and -3, which are used to calculate entries. If a market OPENS already crossing the thresholds and stays there for a while, ignore this stock for today, or increase the thresholds - the last option relies purely on experience, and has minor risks

(!) Do not enter into a position until the signalling candle **finishes** forming - it could become even more signalling, or stop being signalling completely in seconds

# Split your money:

This isn't rocket science nor did I come up with this, but with RAVI it is essential to prevent losses and increase yields: split your money in 3 when entering a trade

***Example:*** 

\- You see a red-buy signal and go long with 1/3, but it keeps going lower. 

\- Once it goes lower *significantly*, enter again with another 1/3rd of your money - you now have 2/3 invested. This is will increase your overall profits and allow you to break even on otherwise losing trades - it is very important and saved my ass countless times during testing. Once the price bounces - exit for a profit at your personal choice - mine is 0.50% total gain per single trade (both entries count as 1 trade)

\- At last, the other 1/3 of your money remaining is to be reserved for an emergency - the price could continue to go lower for a short time, potentially making the trade negative even after pullback. If you see that situation, use the last 1/3rd of the money to enter for one last time, defending your position, and EXIT as soon as the position breaks even - don't wait for profits if you invested 100% of your money. This is, however, quite rare, and becomes even more rare with experience

&amp;#x200B;

[An example of risk management entries with RAVI. With other indicators this strategy actually increases risks, but not with this one it does the opposite. This particular trade is the one I had the bad luck to fall into today, when Mr. JPOW had the entire market nose-dive for about 30 minutes, and I was clueless. Regardless, I ended up benefiting from the trade anyways.](https://preview.redd.it/6qfad07852l61.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c32c045c846a71cd4336f5105fdd4321d9f89c)

# How to exit:

This is the biggest difference from my first guide. Not gonna lie, it was kinda retarded, and I ended up losing money because of it. Here is a much better version, tested for more than a week since then:

1. Number one rule of trading this indicator: **Don't be greedy.**  From looking at countless tickers and situations, I concluded that the vast majority of trades yield a 0.50% before becoming risky, and risk management is insanely important with RAVI. Yes, it's not massive, but you will only need about 4-5 trades a day for a 2% daily gain - a respectable daily goal for professional day traders. With only 10k money in the game, it gives you 200$ per day, or 4 000$+ per month (22 work days).
2. If you had to do three entries (100% of your money), exit as soon as you break even (net total, not on each individual entry). 3-entry trades are quite rare and usually related to bad news causing unexpectedly big moves. When news ruin a trade, you can still sometimes benefit from it, but it is generally safe to exit breaking even. Just remember than when you have all 100% of your money in the trade, you have no more capital left to defend your position in case of a failure, and if after breaking even the price begins to go opposite again, you're fucked.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional tips:

In very rare situations you might have a weakening signal during a trade without confirmation. I couldn't find examples on charts since it happened to me more than a week ago, so here is a hypothetical example:

&amp;#x200B;

[Self explanatory, but anyways: You go long, price goes even lower, but at the same time signal is becoming weaker, which means that it will be extremely hard to return to levels to profit from the initial entry. If you used the 3-times splitting strategy, you are likely to still escape losses or even profit, but that is up to your risk management - the best way is to exit these trades as soon as you can when you spot them](https://preview.redd.it/m00gv0hc82l61.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a63da83fc5cbc47da4b0789e94086de493db0028)

\- **Don't be a pussy**. Sometimes price will continue to go against RAVI signals, but do not be scared and do not exit for a loss - unless you see one of the situations mentioned above. **HODL** is actually a valuable advice with here

\- Do not trade last 1-2 hours of the market, even if the volume is acceptable - you might get caught in a trade that will have to be finished tomorrow - a massive risk to take

\- Always remember: Indecisive stocks - best stocks

\- Always check for news. You do not want any big news before you start trading, as they usually drive price in only 1 direction, and it's hard to profit from them with RAVI

\- Be careful when entering on signals if they happen on retests of a very recent support/resistance, you could get yourself into a very risky situation, although splitting your money will usually save you regardless.

\- Do NOT use this indicator for any other methods of trading - it works awfully with 1hour - 1day candles, as well as being completely useless with Creep Toe (hi mods) because of the spread. Other people suggested more uses for RAVI, but I **did not test them.**

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: The entire guide comes from my personal experience. If you see a mistake prevention tip here, it is because I lost money and learned how to avoid it next time. With this current version of the guide I have been green on the last 8 days, with average profits ranging from 1% to 3% daily. This is hopefully the final version, but I will add more tips if I happen to find another dangerous trap to avoid.
