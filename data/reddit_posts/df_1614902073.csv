43,lxz8ro,"GE or General Electric is one of the largest multinational industrial conglomerates with their hands dipped into many big important and essential sectors of the economy ( aviation, healthcare, power, renewable energy, digital industry, fianance and more). My Dad spent 20 years of his life working at GE oakville ON fixing machines that assembled incandescent light bulbs. It was a great job that paid well and put food on our families tables, that was until the Ontario LIBERAL government made a transition into the crappy mercury lightbulbs, thereby shutting down the GE plant and leaving my father without a job just around the time of the 2008 crash. In the past GE has been very successful and have many many years of successful operation. 

March 10th 2021 GE is hosting their 2020 4th Q webcast where they plan to announce a new direction for the company to be headed towards. It is my thinking GE can continue to be a big name player in many sectors of economy and be innovators and supply the world and other big companies with reliable tech, medication, and innovations down the line. 

ATM it is the 2nd most shorted stock in the industrial conglomerates but only (est 1.08 billion shorted) 1.46% of the float so it wont be the next gamestop.

Anyways tbh the main reason is: I like the stock",Why im going long on GE,0.7,1614902958,Sean-E-Boy

This week, my beloved FROG has slid along with all the other tech stocks.  But I haven't cried tears of sadness as unrealized losses have mounted... just tears of joy at being able to load up even more at a nice discount.  I added 300 more shares, I also added some Dec 55C and rolled my Dec 80C to 55C pretty cheaply.

My March calls are probably going to croak unless there is some miracle and I will probably be assigned my March puts, but I don't mind that b/c I like the stock. 

Hopefully the market comes to its senses soon and these price declines turn around.
