39,mfqjg0,"This is going to be long - I have a lot to say, but you might as well read it otherwise you ape-fingered stock lovers will have to use those hairy appendages to crack open a real book and I think we all know nobody wants to do that. This is not strictly a financial analysis, this is an explanation of the psychedelic therapy industry. Any good book gives you the 5 Ws and an H so that will be the form of this post. Thank you in advance for reading, I hope people can gain some understandings from this and see the potential importance of these therapies. Again, to be clear, the industry will focus on the development of therapies from more than just psilocybin (LSD, MDMA, Ibogaine, DMT, Ketamine etc.) and it is not a recreational market.

(I have a position in $NUMI - something around 3,000 shares @ $1.16 - I think our position must be stated - been invested since last November, average changes as the price does)

**What is psilocybin/psychedelic therapy?**

It is important to understand what drugs/pharmaceuticals do...simply put they are a stimulus that elicits a response and alters the normal functioning of your brain, although your brain is likely not functioning ""normally"" if you are needing pharmaceuticals - all the technical aspects are unnecessary if you understand that (unless you want to know which drug will be most effective and why). Psilocybin therapy will look like molecular derivatives from the original psilocybe mushroom and its main compound (psilocybin) - this is necessary for the development of a pharmaceutical industry, otherwise Advil wouldn't be a successful drug (we need branding and ownership by way of patents).

Our brain is a machine, finely tuned based on genetics and experience throughout life - this is how alcoholism can be inherited and also generated through substance use, many of these machines are not operating correctly and thus need some input to try and get it back to proper functionality (in dumb guy terms, when your big TV doesn't work and you smack it to make it run - the TV is your brain and the drug is the smack). It's all about serotonin baby - psilocybin specifically acts on our serotonergic receptors, it has an affinity for it, it also causes a cortical desynchronization amongst functionally connected regions - if you're fucked up, you probably have some bad connections up in that dome so psilocybin specializes in throwing off those connections and allowing new ones to form. This is why it works best in tandem with therapy...in the psychedelic state, many more states are possible and connections can form more freely, essentially allowing you to build a new bridge - whether you cross it or not is why the therapy helps (typical talk therapy, CBT, cognitive remediation and meditative practice are good options). The key to the success of this industry (and the therapy) is from turning this **state** into a **trait**.

**Why is it effective?**

Psilocybin specifically acts on a variety of brain regions that are key to everything from general cognition, self-understanding/referential thinking and our attentional networks (what you pay attention to is what you think). This therapy is very promising because of its ability to treat co-morbid disorders - if you are an alcoholic you are probably also depressed or anxious, usually you'd have to do some program for the alcoholism, or other addiction and maybe take a drug to counteract the physical effects of not having the substance, but you'd also need another drug for the depression - psilocybin is a one stop shop of sorts. It has been proven highly effective for improving addiction as well as the co-morbid disorders alongside that. Same goes for obesity, you're sort of addicted to food in some ways (although it isn't that simple, it is somewhat similar) and you're depressed because you look bad, you're anxious about disease as well due to your poor health...again multiple treatments needed to help one person. You can't just take a handful of mushrooms and suddenly your PTSD will disappear, that would simply just produce a state. We need to transform this state (or the operation of your brain at that time) into a trait (how your brain will typically operate). Because these disorders/diseases disrupt the functioning of your brain, you need something to alter it - namely a pharmaceutical, what the drug industry won't tell you is that everything alters your brain, something such as going on a walk, hanging out with a friend, listening to music or looking at art - all change your brain, but some brains are severely dysfunctional which is why drugs are needed (but they aren't the only thing needed).

**TLDR;** High level - psilocybin creates an overall cortical desynchronization that allows the brain to operate in a way it wouldn't normally, and leads to a potential shifting of functioning/connectivity between regions.

**Who does it help?**

Research is still young, as there was a large break in its study due to its legislative classification, but we know it is most effective for substance use disorders, obesity, acute stress disorder, PTSD, anxiety, treatment-resistant depression and more (with other potential uses to be discovered for the other substances). There are many companies that have different focuses (or business models) which is important for considering your investment - Tryp Therapeutics focuses on orphan diseases, Neon Mind - obesity, Compass Pathways - treatment-resistant depression...go search it out yourself, but the most likely first use of this therapy will be for depression. There is also the potential for mental health issues that are not on the level of a disorder - you may be sad sometimes, or anxious others but it is not a consistent aspect of your existence. This scenario looks like a microdose (LET ME BE CLEAR - **zero point zero** research has been done on the effectiveness of microdosing, technically it isn't even a word as I get red squiggly's under it as I write, but if it is proven to have some effect you will see people taking these in a similar vein of Adderall or CBD pills with vitamin D - another potential market of psychedelics). The reason some doubt the effectiveness of a microdose is that it does not produce a psychedelic state (which is where the proverbial magic happens with psilocybin therapy), but if it has similar effects on similar brain pathways, a microdose could be a possible therapy and some do swear by it today - but again, there is **NO research** on the topic **YET** (another exciting potential for market growth however).

**TLDR;** most people you lazy shit, this paragraph isn't that long just read it.

**Where is the money?**

THIS IS NOT A RECREATIONAL MARKET.

Ok so as everyone knows, or should be aware of, the world is fucked - mental health issues are on the rise each year and it only continued to grow with the pandemic. For some quick maths we can add up the ""value"" or ""cost"" of the various disorders that psychedelics can treat (again more treatment uses will be available with further R&amp;D). I'm just going to do a few to give you an example of the scale of this treatment, which is likely (although I'll be honest not proven) a more effective treatment.

Mental health disorders will cost the global economy $16 trillion (USD) by 2030. ([https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/mental-illness-will-cost-world-16-usd-trillion-2030](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/mental-illness-will-cost-world-16-usd-trillion-2030))

The total cost in the US alone of major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated at $210 billion annually - this is not how much the treatment of the disorder is ""worth"" but rather how much it ""costs"" based on absenteeism (missing work) and presenteeism (lack of productivity at work) - caveat, I do wonder how exactly they calculate these so I don't swear by these numbers but it is a good estimate. (Businesses spend money not to lose money - keep that in mind)

([http://www.workplacementalhealth.org/Mental-Health-Topics/Depression/Quantifying-the-Cost-of-Depression](http://www.workplacementalhealth.org/Mental-Health-Topics/Depression/Quantifying-the-Cost-of-Depression))

Depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion (USD) annually due to lost productivity - important to recall that psilocybin itself can treat up to 5 disorders that we know of right now and the other psychedelics which are also part of the market will treat others in addition.

([https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/mental-health-in-the-workplace](https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/mental-health-in-the-workplace))

Global antidepressants market is expected to grow from $14.3 billion in 2019 to about $28.6 billion in 2020 and given the increased rates you can assume this number will continue to grow - this is only depression people, not all the other disorders/disease treatable by psychedelics.

([http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/21/2019282/0/en/Global-Antidepressants-Market-2020-to-2030-COVID-19-Implications-and-Growth.html](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/21/2019282/0/en/Global-Antidepressants-Market-2020-to-2030-COVID-19-Implications-and-Growth.html))

Over the next 8 years (I believe this started in 2014) the US will have spent $4.2 trillion on treating obesity-related disease (remember that almost 40% of men and women in the US are considered obese), Germany will spend $390 billion, Brazil $251 billion and the UK $237 billion if nothing is done to try to prevent it (and not much has been).

([https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/treating-obesity-related-illness-will-cost-12tn-a-year-from-2025-experts-warn](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/treating-obesity-related-illness-will-cost-12tn-a-year-from-2025-experts-warn))

Ok so as I am attempting to show here, a metric butt-ton is spent on various disorders/diseases that psilocybin could treat more effectively, and there is an even greater economic cost globally due to how these disorders/diseases impact productivity and availability (the best ability is availability baby). I said in my previous post that this could potentially (not this year, not in 5 years, but sometime in the future that I don't know) be a $200 billion industry and I believe that is a low estimate in all fairness. Seems insane, but I think the numbers show the severe cost of mental health disorders/diseases and the extremely high revenue of pharmaceutical companies off of these disorders. I am not going to make another estimate - I just gave some numbers which you can add up (and there are more numbers to be considered as I didn't mention all potential treatments) to devise the potential market and the costs associated with it. Again, people will spend money to not lose as much money. According to the WHO, every $1 spent on scaling up treatment will have a return of $4 in productivity - using my calculator, spending $4 trillion will reduce the global economic burden of mental health disorders. I must reiterate, there are many other drugs/compounds under investigation that fall under the category of psychedelics and those too will be used to help relieve this burden and acquire revenue.

There will be money in the education behind this market - teaching medical students about its use, practitioners will need training etc...a variety of markets behind this as well.

**TLDR;** Pathway to profitability - regulatory approval, clinics opened up for the specific purpose of psilocybin therapy, molecular derivative creation...testing...and patenting - leading to the creation of new pharmaceuticals to be sold to reduce the growing epidemic of mental health disorders and their extreme cost on the global economy.

**BUT THERE COULD BE A RECREATIONAL MARKET.**

Microdosing is another potential market for psilocybin specifically, which could open up another revenue stream - research is pending and studies are on the way but not yet. Just important to understand that there is potential market expansion with the lower doses vs. the higher therapeutic doses.

**How will the industry grow?**

Sadly, the industry will grow as mental health issues and global health issues do. As long as these kids keep tik-toking there will be a whole new generation of anxious, depressed and stressed people that need help. The cannabis industry needed legalization as the money will come from the recreational market - much like alcohol, they need it to be widely available to everyone (legalization is an arduous process), that is just a bonus for the psychedelic sector. This is a misunderstanding of the highest level to compare psychedelics to the cannabis industry, but I still anticipate people doing that in the comments, oh well...you can't fix stupid - but maybe psychedelics can! There is no need for legalization, it is all about the approval of health regulators - which is going well as the FDA last October granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin for the treatment of depression...all is going in the right direction now.

The industry will continue to grow (catalysts) with more research, funding and education (all 3 going hand in hand...the more research, the better the results, the more funding and the more education). There are still many other substances that have not been studied to great lengths and will likely prove to be effective as treatments for other disorders/diseases, yet again expanding the psychedelic therapy market (MDMA is already in late stage trials for the treatment of PTSD for example).

**TLDR;** research, funding and education (of all the substances associated with the psychedelic therapy industry)

**When will this occur?** (last one keep going, jesus this is long and I'm transcribing from a Word doc)

Breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA is massive, similar approvals should continue as more trials/studies are completed. This is the toughest aspect to nail down - I can tell you that given the increased incidence rate of mental health disorders and diseases globally it will be sooner rather than later for psilocybin (and MDMA), the others will be later.

Timeline for **1)** making money and **2)** getting this therapy available to the public:

**1)** Months ago you could have made money on a lot of these companies, so the sooner you get in the better (given the correct selection of organizations, you can do that research yourself but I will say MindMed is not going to be a leader in the industry the way they are going, but you can still make money on them in the meantime). It is important to remember, not everyone in the industry now will be in it for the long run.

**2)** This is for global use, not just an American organization or a Western therapy...it is going to be used globally (I mean other than in China unless they go for some mind control type experiments a la the CIA with LSD) by most first-world countries that can afford the R&amp;D and regulation - sorry my Russian comrades I don't think you count as first-world, but the others are and will be getting in on this.

Now, **this is not an investment strategy or advice.** This has been a breakdown of the industry and its potential. How you play this market is up to you - maybe someone can devise a strategy and share with the others. It is **extremely important** to understand that the inevitability of further capital raising will impact the share price due to potential dilution. That is my one word of caution that has no bearing on the actual performance or potential of the industry, but it does impact your ability to maximize the bag - ensure you have a proper entry and exit strategy to avoid getting burned because there will be further capital raising.

Best of luck - if you enjoyed this and somehow made it, throw an upvote on this bitch, this is my first in depth (and probably last) post so I hope that I have made some sense, shed some light and encouraged you about the potential of these therapies. If you think I'm an idiot or a hippie let me know in the comments and as I said before...I just like getting high.

After joining the subreddit i wondered what was the best way to profit from all the valuable knowledge shared here. 

So i looked for the first stock mentioned that wasn't GME and put all my savings on it.

Is it how this works?

**-Banking stocks are trading at a huge discount right now**

Thanks to our fellow retards at Archegos, many banking stocks have been taking a hit recently over fears they might endure losses from the margin call. **These fears are unrealistic, and have only led to a nice discount in the stock price right now. I see opportunity where others see fear. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**-The fed will allow banks to reinstate dividends and authorize buybacks this summer, bringing the boomers in for reinforcements.**

And I'll be fucking **damned** if those geriatric fucks beat us to the tendies. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I trust the cloud a lot though indicators are technically lagging but im also not retarded enough to ignore a weekly death cross because that is very bearish. also our light green line (lagging span) is very close to touching the candles which usually indicated lots of movement aka lots of IV aka more tendies than usual.

not financial advisor, ive lost more money than ill ever make. im all in  $80 4/16 puts. as i type this the stock is rebounding but so long as its moving in bear flag formation ill be holding my puts as i still see a short term 16% dump and a weekly term 50% dump as per my last analysis which was removed due to not getting many upvotes.  this trade comes with lots of risk but reward is also substantial in proportion, do ur own DD, weight ur own balls.

tdlr: not financial advice, I hate the stock, and this combo is as good as a bear will ever eat.

91,mfr3t8,"Trade: $YETI 7 MAY $67 Calls from present till 28 April

&amp;#x200B;

Thesis:$YETI bottomed out its Implied Volatility cycle and is running sideways on a rollercoaster. I'm 'Rooish on the stock. As implied volatility increases up to the peak of the cycle it will drive up the Extrinsic Value of the Calls. Meanwhile the Intrinsic Value of the calls will increase during the upswings of the rollercoaster.

&amp;#x200B;

There is an opportunity to maximize profit by converging these two forces, selling on the upswing of intrinsic and extrinsic value which should occur roughly around 28 April.

&amp;#x200B;

Price target on 7 May (Strike): $70 but it doesnt matter

&amp;#x200B;

How did I arrive at this number? I drew lines on a chart with my fingers and guesstimated. So its fake and means nothing. It’s also the average price of the rollercoaster IMO, I think the coaster is shrinking but should at least average to $70.

&amp;#x200B;

Price target on 28 April (profit day): $67.27-73.86

&amp;#x200B;

Am I allowed to offer a range as a price target? I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

The $67.27 is where I believe the implied volatility cycle peaks and intersects with the bottoming out of the rollercoaster, which is the worst case outcome, low intrinsic as extrinsic maxes, but you take a profit mostly of the extrinsic and a very small gain in intrinsic.

&amp;#x200B;

The $73.86 is the peak of the coaster around the implied volatility and peak. intrinsic to the tits. extrinsic pretty damn high.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think it plays out this way? The Greeks and The Underlying -

&amp;#x200B;

Greeks: Delta 0.7 Theta (0.0544) Vega 0.0841 - I fully believe the implied volatility will increase from about .53 to .8 driving the extrinsic up by about $2 over the next 30 days, hedging the $1.63 theta decay.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakeven on implied volatility gains against the theta decay is an increase of implied volatility by .19 to .72. Also, I’m anticipating exiting the position early negating the last bit of Theta Decay. Basically, sell on the upswing closest to 28 APR.

&amp;#x200B;

The Underlying:

&amp;#x200B;

Earnings: projected earnings to occur 6 May, meaning I expect the implied volatility cycle to increase to peak or near-peak by 28 April, just a bit before earnings

&amp;#x200B;

Earnings outlook: $YETI is strapped with cash and just expanded further in the consumer space to bags. Anecdotally I feel its the case that YETI has an unusually high attach rate for the space its in. I think people will think YETI is reporting favorable earnings, driving the price up on its way to earnings.
