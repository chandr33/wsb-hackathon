1,m6qyvc,[removed],I feel like a virgin on his wedding night. I’ve waited 45 days to post in this thread.,1.0,1615951230,Investyourvalues
2,m6qyzh,"Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.

Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.

He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""

He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.

They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.

HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.

He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.

TLDR

So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.

Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.

Intrigued yet?

I plan to hold this 10 years plus.

11,m6r2uz,"Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future. 

One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.

Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.

""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release. 

And so they did, but then they had a problem.

The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know. 

And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.

Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""

And this was the game that they made up:

#Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours to flip again.

This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in. 

This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time you wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias.

This is part 2. Part one got taken down due to a clerical error on my part. I'm really just Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I just was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if that's not enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike.
