A month ago I posted about Datto, $MSP([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6a3g/datto\_msp\_options\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6a3g/datto_msp_options_play/)), a backup/disaster recovery service &amp; network equipment manufacturer for IT Consultants(Managed Service Providers), and how there was a solid options play around their earnings report on 3/11. A month later, and that play still exists.

The $20 call options for 3/19 ask is currently $5.90, and the stock is at \~$25.30. This means the stock only has to go up $0.60 during their earnings report release tomorrow for this to be a winner. Seems like a really low IV, and a solid play. The $25 call option has a really low bar to make money on it too.

Lyrics:

Crank the speakers till the point that they're blown  


Inside of my laboratory residing beneath my home  


We'll broadcast Universally, Binary Code  


Portray my plea in 1s and 0s  


Satellites spit sophisticated notes  


superior intelligence than NASA knows  


Boost the frequency right up into the Cosmos  


Scan the open air for all of them UFOs  


Accentuate the signal right up into the galaxy  


Searching out an astrological anomaly  


Increase the bandwidth and the connection speed  


Scream into the stars Beam Me Up, Scotty  


Stowaway Spaceship ride to tranquility  


For a minute up there, I would give up gravity  


Post transmission we outta here  


Mentally prepare ourselves to up and disappear  


Activate Curiosity, the New Frontier  


Abstract abyss leaving the stratosphere  


Alienate myself till noone is near  


Then accelerate the afterburners through the atmosphere

&amp;#x200B;

From Here: I see all of the twinkling spheres  


Not afraid although height is my biggest fear  


Look beyond the clouds, Wonder what's that?  


Mystery no longer my friends, We've made Contact.

&amp;#x200B;

\#ToTheMoon   
\#HODL  


Im not an astronaut, this is not space travel advice. Godspeed.

92,m1z6je,"We heard it from Tiger first. 

**NIKE is set to flop their earnings release on 3/18**. Wall Street analysts have their projections wrong, and I've updated my price target for NIKE to **$115**. I'm expecting embarrassing low earnings reported on the 18th. 

**NIKE spent $3.6 billion on advertising in 2020**. That's.. about the same as 2018 and 2019. And we were all stuck at home 😂 Consumers have been locked in their homes and out of jobs. Athletic wear, footwear? What if we put a hat on Tiger? What if he have him do another one of those crash things? 

**You want to know who is not buying footwear and athletic wear right now? Humans.** The only talk I've heard about anyone buying NIKE is from the niche drop kids. The past year, America has not been shopping NIKE.

We're all at home - **your ass is at home right now reading this**. People are doing shopping online - Hold on let me get this.

More people are searching. The decline heading up to this earnings call still 😂 Even if you're buying some hyped-up b.s. not to play sports with, you're taking that sh\*t off before you come in my house. 

To be honest, I don't know sh\*t about NIKE. I don't know if they sell baseball bats so I included sporting goods 😂 But what I do know, is consumers are buying less of their sh\*t, they're shoving the same amount of ads in our faces, using the super bowl as a cop-out to act like they spent less on ads, and I don't like the stock.
