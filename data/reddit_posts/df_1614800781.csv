&amp;#x200B;

Long ago when DFV started preaching the GME bull case, he saw it as a value buy. He did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store. When people compared Gamestop to Blockbuster, he laughed.

Since Gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention, he has been under a microscope. Billions of dollars see him as the leader, and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for. Everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal, but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons. Given the wave of new hires, I thought now would be a good time to formally discuss the company's mid to long term potential.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ryan Cohen Vision**

If you have any money in Gamestop, you better already know this part. That being said, you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again.

Ryan Cohen founded Chewy in 2011 and served as the CEO until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3B. This marked the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company and speaks to RC's expertise in e-commerce. This man is the messiah.

&amp;#x200B;

On 11/16/20, Cohen formally wrote a letter to the Gamestop board of directions, detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it. Within it, he discussed:

\- The growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer

\- The large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program

\- Gamestop's unwillingness to change with the times

\- Gamestop's hardships amid the 'gaming boom'

&amp;#x200B;

His letter made it clear that he has a vision for what Gamestop could be, and that he has a plan to get it there. He recently upped his stake from 9-12.91% on 1/12/21, which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround. If we have any chance of making it to valhalla, Ryan Cohen will lead us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Draining the swamp**

As Cohen expressed in his letter, one of the main reasons for Gamestop's fall was its lack of competent leadership. The ship has been sinking for years, and its crew has been suspiciously negligent. While conspiracy theories exist that Gamestop execs tanked the company in an effort to insider trade with hedge funds, we'll keep the tinfoil hats off today.

*Jim Bell- Former CFO*

On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Jim Bell, CFO, would be 'resigning'. Myself and many others believe that he was forced out by the new wave, which is supported by [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-is-surging-again-and-no-one-can-say-why-51614208357). His background shows he worked primarily with brick and mortar establishments which won't be relevant for the RC vision.

&amp;#x200B;

*New board nominees -* [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html)

On January 11th, 2021, it was announced that Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, and Jim Grube are new nominees for the board of directors. They stand up for election at the ""annual meeting of stockholders"" which is expected to take place in June 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

[Alan Attal - Former Chewy CMO and COO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-attal)

One of Cohen's Chewy buddies, Attal will serve a valuable role in Gamestop's transformation to the digital age. He specializes in e-commerce, marketing, and could help tapping into Gamestop's 55 million customers registered to their rewards program.

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan Cohen - The Messiah

Enough said

&amp;#x200B;

[Jim Grube Former Chewy CFO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-grube-7141931)

Grube specializes in e-commerce which is especially crucial for Gamestop's current situation. While has not yet been appointed CFO of Gamestop, I find him to be the most likely candidate. If so, he will be tasked with the trainwreck that is Gamestop.

&amp;#x200B;

*Board nominees likely not up for re-election*

Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck. I'm too lazy to get into detail here but these people are dead weight and do not seem to align with the Cohen vision.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Other notable hires**

*Matt Francis - CTO*

Francis began working for GameStop on 2/15/21. He has worked in the e-commerce industry for more than two decades and recently worked with Amazon Web Services. He could play a big role in the modernization of Gamestop's business model. [source](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer) \- [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis)

&amp;#x200B;

*Kelli Durkin - Senior VP of Customer Care*

Durkin began working for Gamestop on 3/1/21 and was part of the RC Chewy cohort. She will bring her world-class customer service operation to Gamestop and could help to tap into the large customer base that was mentioned earlier. - [her linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelli-durkin-4552229)

&amp;#x200B;

*Josh Kreuger- Vice President of Fulfillment*

Krueger previously worked for Amazon and Walmart, and began working on 3/1/21. His job is especially critical as Gamestop's ability to fulfill orders in a timely fashion will ultimately determine their ability to compete with competitors. - [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-krueger-b80ba03a)

&amp;#x200B;

**Notable differences**

As many of you have pointed out, Gamestop has already made a few concrete changes which is quite impressive. They now offer same-day delivery to many locations by utilizing doordash. They were able to tap into a stable network and instantly made themselves a competitor. They have also added many pc parts such as gfx cards to their website. While it may be too soon for these new hires to have caused these changes, they are first-steps in making Gamestop the powerhouse that it once was. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Lots of good new hires, and bad people being let down. I like the stock üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ




COMMENT FROM u/talascio points out:
‚ÄúThe next big GME move to look out for is probably going to be the current CEO George Sherman ""resigning""

Before becoming the CEO of GameStop, Sherman was the CEO of Victra, a Verizon retailer that runs brick and mortar Verizon stores.

His tenure at Victra was extremely short, leading me to believe he wasn't the easiest person to work with and found a home in the pre-Cohen GameStop swamp.  Not to mention that a CEO that specializes in B&amp;M locations is the polar opposite of the future vision for GME.

The news that Sherman has ""resigned"" is going to be an insane catalyst, things are only looking good from here on out‚Äù",DRAINING THE SWAMP - GME NOTABLE HIRES,0.94,1614800898,NickGarber17
