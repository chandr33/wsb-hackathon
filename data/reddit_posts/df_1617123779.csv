So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&amp;#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&amp;#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

&amp;#x200B;

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now.

1. Money.
2. It covers asses.
3. It more easily shifts blame.
4. It may make some sell early.
5. It may cause some to get margin called.

Hello everybody,

I am a first-time poster and very new trader, and I do not have much skin in the game because my wife's boyfriend told her not to give me too much money. Criticize me all you want, and criticize my shitty username even more. I have, however, taken it as a challenge to grow a small sum into as much as I can with the riskiest plays possible. GME and AMC are about 90% of my holdings now, partially because I used to consider them high risk/high reward, and partially because I believe a crash is coming and AMC/GME are potential hedges against it due to the short interest.

I do not know much about finance. I am not a financial advisor. Almost everything in this post is conjecture, and any perceived criticisms, accusations, or sentiments are not leveled at any specific person, group, or business in particular. I use intentionally vague language for a reason, and that reason is that I do not much at all of the inner-workings of this. This entire post is almost entirely fiction based on a narrative I know very little about.

My first degree was in social sciences, so my thoughts and opinions in this matter are primarily focused on what is essentially the battle that is happening, rather than the finance side of the issues. I believe that this is fitting, as GME is currently detached from financial rules/norms to some extent and highly rooted in sentiment and a mental game of encouraging sell-offs and buy-ins. As some have probably already noted, this saga is becoming more and more psychological as time goes on:

* Progressively more sophisticated FUD campaigns
* Bad Faith Actors
* News Manipulation
* Short Ladder Attacks

The reason I am doing this is because I have learned more in the last 2 months than I have ever before, almost completely thanks to WSB and other finance subs. I want to pay the Reddit community back by promoting discussion and potentially spurring new theories so somebody can really nail down what's happening with this phenomenon. My apologies about the scattered thoughts on this matter, it came to me as a possibility in the shower this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would anybody want to crash the market preemptively?**

Simply, **money**. The loss of money from a down market may not outweigh the loss from short fees, particularly if one were to cash out early. If multiple parties are involved, if one group is first to realize this strategy, they can liquidate and make more than others. If the group knows a crash is coming either way, they can make money on it by being the genesis of it (Think “The Big Short”). If groups are beginning to see that they have to liquidate either way, they will do so earlier rather than later in order to capitalize.

Of course, this is (probably) a last ditch strategy for many reasons, but that may be where the saga is at this current point in time as other methods of trying to kill off the share price have clearly not worked.  


**The covering of asses.**

If the market downturn were to occur closer to the GME squeeze hiting its apex (i.e. groups liquidate to pay the expense), the focus of policy makers would be on how GME got to the point it could crash the market. It makes the cause (GME exploding) very clear to the effect (the market crashing).

If the market downturn were to occur well beforehand, then other factors can be blamed. Potentially, this can take the focus away from the short interest GME has taken on, and now allows the onus to shift to other potential factors, such as gross overvaluation of some sectors/stocks, general short interest within the markets, etc. This is a good thing for some as it helps those that have been engaging in shady investment practices obfuscate their actions and motives. If the end result means jail time for some, then the crashing of the market  is something that has already been considered.

**The shifting of blame.**

In hand with the covering of asses, more factors (not just GME Short &gt; GME up &gt; Have to pay the shorts &gt; Liquidate &gt; Market Crash) allow blame to be shifted more easily for the same reasons.

If the market is already going down, then why not spread uncertainty about why?

**An early sell off of GME.**

If my life savings are thrown into any degree of investments and my car breaks down, if we’re in the middle of a crash, where would I pull money from to fix it? Personally, I wouldn’t normally pull it from a blue chip that will recover, I’d pull from a FOMO stock that is still doing well that I would want to realize some degree of profits from anyways. To that point, if I have used GME as a hedge, why wouldn’t somebody choose to cash in on that hedge while it is still going strong compared to the rest of the market? Leaving a certain amount of time between the crash and the boom of GME allows for more shares to reenter the float.

**Margin calls for retail investors.**

With point 4, other stocks dropping could cause people to get margin called, forcing them to liquidate their positions in GME. This could create the opportunity to buy short positions back at a lower price, which is the goal for these groups that are already forced to pay too much.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I feel like we're getting close to endgame because of the current confluence of events. Do I have a timeline on it? No, not at all.

What do I mean by the confluence of events?

1. The NSCC/DTCC/FICC ruling. This indicates big things may be coming.
2. The margin call of Archegos. Not much is known about further holdings, but this presents an opportunity to shift blame from GME S.I. elsewhere.
3. Overvaluation with inflation worries.
4. The dying off of FOMO. In essence, the real diamond handers have been weeded from the rest.
5. Rapidly building interest on the shorts.

What else will endgame look like? I haven't the foggiest clue, but the lack of short ladder attacks these last two days is (in my opinion) the calm before the storm. If I had to guess, we may see another huge attack coupled with something made to instill panic (such as a market crash).

While I have the platform, a couple other thoughts:

The sheer fact that the psychological campaign is happening against the DD writers, WSB board, etc, means there’s truth in this somewhere. Personally, if nothing were happening to GME and its proponents, I would pull. That there was such huge resistance on a number of levels means a group does not want people talking about GME, writing DD, etc. In addition to that, I know that if I get hate on this thread or in my inbox, I know I’ll be on to something.

Perhaps I will add more onto my post later, but as of right now I just want to throw this out there and see the response. Let’s discuss!",GME and my Theory on the Market Downturn,1.0,1617125228,Comprehensive-Dirt45

2. Selling  $30 billion of shares in 4 days is too much too fast and a 50% correction on VIAC is not justified.  It takes a few days to weeks for most \*less than the brightest\* to do math, communicate, and realize the price is super low. Wells fargo says it has finished liquidating to meet the margin call.

3. VIAC did a $3 billion offering while it was over extended up at $100 per  share and they now have \~$3 billion more cash than DISCA does. This is a chad move and a rare opportunity for them to acquire or build something  incredible--I'm not going to speculate as to what, but I'm confident they will do something dank.

92,mglpaw,Due to the most recent news about HF bankruptcy etc. I began to think about what if this happened to one of the big market makers in the USA. Let's take citadel for example. I believe they handle something like 30+% of all trades for the market. Who fills this void should someone this large go away? Could the system even survive something this big? Any input would be nice.,What happens if a market maker goes bankrupt?,0.99,1617126504,-nocturnist-
