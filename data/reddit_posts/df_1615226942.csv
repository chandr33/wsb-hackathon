Unpopular opinion in this subreddit: you shouldn't spend money you can't  afford to lose on any stock, as well as GME. 

There are thousands of people joining the GME hype-train, YOLOing all they have into the stock and they have no idea there is VERY high possibility of losing it. Not many people gain from this ""ape-run"". I was lucky enough not to lose anything, because I was patient and waited through the loss-phase we went through. This can, and very probably will, happen again and quite soon.

Take this as a friendly reminder to reconsider your financial choices you are about to make.

## Big movements in HUMBL, Inc. stock price on Friday moving 27.27% between high and low (Updated on March 05, 2021) 

Buy or Hold candidate since 2020-10-19 Gain 1 749 900.00% [  PDF ](https://stockinvest.us/pdf/technical-analysis/TSNPD) 

The **HUMBL, Inc.** stock price gained **11.11%** on the last trading day (Friday, 5th Mar 2021), rising from **$3.15** to **$3.50**. During the day the stock fluctuated **27.27%** from a day low at **$2.75** to a day high of **$3.50**. The price has fallen in 5 of the last 10 days, but is still up by **227.1%** over the past 2 weeks. Volume fell on the last day by **-10 million** shares and in total, **15** million shares were bought and sold for approximately **$51.89**  million. You should take into consideration that falling volume on  higher prices causes divergence and may be an early warning about  possible changes over the next couple of days.

The stock lies in the middle of a very wide  and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the  trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is  expected to rise **100.69%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$2.18** and **$10.12** at the end of this 3-month period.

### Signals &amp; Forecast

The **HUMBL, Inc.** stock holds  buy signals from both short and long-term moving averages giving a  positive forecast for the stock. Also, there is a general buy signal  from the relation between the two signals where the short-term average  is above the long-term average. On corrections down, there will be some  support from the lines at **$3.10** and **$1.25**.  A breakdown below any of these levels will issue sell signals.  Furthermore, there is a buy signal from the 3 months Moving Average  Convergence Divergence (MACD). Volume fell during the last trading day  despite gaining prices. This causes a divergence between volume and  price and it may be an early warning. The stock should be watched  closely. Some negative signals were issued as well, and these may have  some influence on the near short-term development. A sell signal was  issued from a pivot top point on **Friday, February 26, 2021**, and so far it has fallen -27.54%. Further fall is indicated until a new bottom pivot has been found. 

### Support, Risk &amp; Stop-loss

On the downside, the stock finds support just below today's level from  accumulated volume at $3.15. With no support from accumulated volume  below today's level the risk is increased, as a drop below the support  at $0.0000 may give a huge drop in the stock price. 

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very  large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is  considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$0.75** between high and low, or **27.27%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **20.09%**. 

Our recommended stop-loss:  **$3.31 (-5.34%)**  (This stock has very high daily movements and this gives very high  risk. There is a sell signal from a pivot top found 5 day(s) ago.) 

### Is HUMBL, Inc. stock A Buy? 

Several short-term signals, along with a general good trend, are  positive and we conclude that the current level may hold a buying  opportunity as there is a fair chance for **HUMBL, Inc.** stock to perform well in the short-term. 

Current score: 2.961
