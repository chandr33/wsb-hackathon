56,m18rnv,"Just wanted to post some near term GME and AMC catalysts. Not a financial advisor, not financial advice, just have a small penis. 

So obviously AMC has earnings. NASDAQ article says that AMC should beat earnings (earnings wont be good but beating market expectations would send it up). AMC's guidance/call will be what could really send it up. The CEO seems to be a big fan of retail traders and wants the stock to continue to rise so he can eventually offer more shares to raise $ (he definitely won't do this for another few months tho). If AMC gives a really good guidance (possible buyout, increased digital/streaming activity, etc), this could go very high. Another important thing is that FINRA is releasing short position numbers today after hours. If AMC has a gigantic short interest, that will definitely push it up, especially because earnings are the next day. What's even better is that the borrow fee keeps rising rapidly (it's currently above 12%). 

For GME, the same thing applies to GME about the short position report today. We also know that March 10th is Mario day. I wouldn't put it past Ryan Cohen to announce something, tweet, or do something else that could make the price rise. We have also seen that AMC and GME move similarly. If AMC rises significantly on earnings, GME could easily follow. 

I want to make clear, however, that this is not an end-all-be-all prediction, these are just some near-term catalysts. I personally, believe that these stocks real shoot up will be between March 19- 25 (quad witching day through earnings). Remember that Ryan Cohen could bless us with a tweet or announcement at any moment, so that's always a possibility.
