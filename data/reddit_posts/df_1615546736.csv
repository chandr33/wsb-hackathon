TL;DR for the glue sniffers up the back at the end

**RocketLab** is the world’s current leading smallsat launcher with its Electron launch vehicle and is the second most frequently launched orbital rocket in the United States. Electron can launch payloads of up to 300kg to LEO (Low Earth Orbit), and to date has launched 97 satellites for governments and private companies across 16 missions from May of 2017[*^(\[1\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/investors). The CEO of Rocket Lab, Peter Beck, has previously stated that Rocket Lab did not intend to build bigger or reusable rockets, and if they did he would eat his hat… which he then promptly did live on twitter[*^(\[2\])*](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-eats-his-hat-yes-really/).

**Vector Acquisitions Corp** is a blank-check SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) with the sole purpose of taking a private company public through a SPAC merger[*^(\[3\])*](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/vacq-stock-13-things-to-know-about-vector-acquisition-and-the-rocket-labs-spac-merger/). Vector currently manages over $4 billion in equity capital from a variety of investors[*^(\[4\])*](https://www.vectorcapital.com/about). Founder, CEO, and Chief Investment Officer of Vector Capital, Alex Slusky, has stated *“Rocket Lab is a once-in-a-generation company that is democratizing access to space through its constant innovation, leading technology and proven execution … Rocket Lab is ideally positioned to continue to capture market share in the rapidly expanding space launch, systems and applications markets … Vector is thrilled to partner with Rocket Lab as it seeks to capitalize on unprecedented commercial and government spending in the burgeoning space economy”*[*^(\[5\])*](https://news.satnews.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-spacs-up-to-become-a-publicly-traded-company-unveil-their-new-launch-vehicle/).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Image: Left - Electron, Right - Neutron. Electron is literally already flying and Neutron is expected to start flying in 2024. 🚀 ](https://preview.redd.it/vsrzm2lywkm61.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9f84163339e9f8fe9ab4a54bfd887b40c27d9ec)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is V-A-C-Q a Good Investment?**

Since the announcement of the merger[*^(\[6\])*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/space-startup-rocket-lab-to-go-public-in-latest-spac-deal), the currently listed $V-A-C-Q on NASDAQ rose 40% before declining 20% to where it sits currently at a share price of $12.41. Rocket Lab also unveiled plans to build a new launch vehicle, Neutron, that will have a payload capacity to LEO of 8,000kg which will also be human rated. Neutron will also be capable of 2,000 kg to the Moon and 1,500 kg to Mars[*^(\[7\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/rocket-lab-unveils-plans-for-new-8-ton-class-reusable-rocket-for-mega-constellation-deployment/). At least the first stage of Neutron’s 2 stage design will be fully reusable. With the recently renewed interest in spaceflight; reusability and lowering launch costs are paramount for a successful launch provider.

Additionally, NASA still plans to return to the moon, which means Rocket Lab could potentially be contracted to deliver cargo to Lunar Orbit. The first launch of Neutron is expected to be in 2024, around the same time NASA initially planned to send humans back to the moon. Rocket Lab has stated that **Neutron will be able to deliver 98% of all forecasted spacecraft through to 2029**[*^(\[8\])*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/), at which point they could reveal a new vehicle in the heavy-lift-launch category.

Neutron has been **designed to service customers launching large multi-satellite constellations**[*^(\[8\])*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/). This could potentially hint at Rocket Lab competing with SpaceX’s Starlink internet constellation, of which further evidence is provided by Alex Slusky who sits on the board of directors[*^(\[9\])*](https://www.vectorcapital.com/team/detail/alex-slusky) for Cambium Networks[*^(\[10\])*](https://investors.cambiumnetworks.com/index.php/board-member/alexander-r-slusky) (Internet) and WatchGuard Technologies[*^(\[11\])*](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-about/leadership) (Security, Internet). Slusky has also previously been on the board of directors for Technicolor (Digital Media, some internet)[*^(\[12\])*](https://www.technicolor.com/distribute/home-experience/access/wireless). Perhaps the greatest piece of evidence is this quote from Rocket Lab: *“ … Proceeds also expected to fund organic and inorganic growth in the space systems market and support expansion into space applications enabling Rocket Lab to deliver data and services from space”.* [*^(\[1\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/investors)

**The Market for Rocket Lab**

Rocket Lab has an established record of launching (most) payloads reliably to orbit, and as such is in a unique position to extends its lead in space solutions. The market forecast of which is expected to grow to $1.4 Trillion by 2030[*^(\[1\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/investors). The merger with Vector will provide a lot of capital to fund development of the Neutron launch vehicle. Rocket Lab forecasts that it will generate positive adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in 2023, positive cash flows in 2024 and more than $1 billion in revenue in 2026. [*^(\[1\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/investors)

Transaction with Vector expected to close Q2 2021 and will appear publicly listed under $RKLB on NASDAQ. It’s possible to invest right now as Vector is currently traded under $V-A-C-Q on NASDAQ. The merger transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Rocket Lab and Vector. [*^(\[1\])*](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/investors)

**Media Reactions, Speculation, and Competition**

**•** The most prominent figure in spaceflight currently, Elon Musk, has potentially reacted to the news by posting a cryptic tweet: “Green Eggs &amp; SPAC”[*^(\[13\])*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1366514542939828224). This could allude to Elon poking fun of Rocket Lab for dismissing reusable, human-rated, and larger rockets. Or it could refer to something else entirely.

**•** YouTuber Scott Manley has posted on twitter that Neutron might be able to deliver Boeing’s Starliner to orbit for human spaceflight[*^(\[14\])*](https://twitter.com/DJSnM/status/1366471914147827712). Starliner is a crew capsule like SpaceX’s dragon capsule, but it is unlikely Rocket Lab would ever launch Starliner.

**•** With Rocket Lab able to deliver substantial cargo to the moon, they would be competing with three much larger companies who plan to deliver not just cargo to the moon, but also humans AND to the lunar surface[*^(\[15\])*](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/ls9g88/nasa_says_maintaining_competition_a_priority_for/). NASA is currently reviewing three proposals for human-rated lunar landers: SpaceX’s Star ship/Lunar ship, Blue Origin National Team’s Blue Moon[*^(\[16\])*](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/nasa-selects-blue-origin-national-team-to-return-humans-to-the-moon) [*^(\[17\])*](https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon/national-team), and Dynetics’ Lander. NASA cannot fund all 3 but wants to fund 2 for competition, but if they select Blue Origin, they can only fund them solely[*^(\[18\])*](https://spacenews.com/nasa-says-maintaining-competition-a-priority-for-lunar-lander-procurement/). This provides a unique opportunity for Rocket Lab to develop a very low-cost lander without the funding of NASA, but also deliver very small payloads to the Lunar Surface. Likely Blue Origin will be dumped in favour of SpaceX and Dynetics, leaving another company to potentially fill the hole.

**TL;DR**

• RocketLab is developing a new reusable rocket to deliver satellite constellations to orbit

• RocketLab will be able to deliver cargo to the Moon and Mars

• RocketLab will be competing in some markets with SpaceX, mainly internet.

• Neutron will be able to deliver 98% of all forecasted payloads through to 2029

• Neutron is a medium-lift launch vehicle that can lift 8T to LEO, 2T to Lunar, &amp; 1.5T to Mars

• Neutron will be human-rated, and could potentially be used to launch humans to the ISS, with the possibility to transfer crew to another vehicle for Lunar and maybe even Mars landings.

Rocket Lab’s launches are exponentially increasing year after year. The company is going to have a lot of capital to fund its new rocket, and with its ability to deliver cost effect launches will rival SpaceX. This is potentially a Deep Value play.

**In short, I like the stock.**

Goonies, it is time to RISE UP.  It is OUR TIME to rule.  It is time to shake off the hate they have tried to instill in us and divide us with over the last four years. It is time to remove our shackles from the propaganda machine.  It is time to stop believing the lies being spread in the media.  If you still believe what you are seeing and reading in the news, it is time to WAKE UP.  This has never been more evident than now, with how the news is trying to manipulate the AMC and GME stock coverage.  Have you never wondered where the news talking points, we are fed 24 hour a day, come from?  These talking points come from the same people who OWN the Media, OWN the Federal Reserve, OWN the majority of stock shares, and OWN our congress members.  We were raised to be freethinkers; yet they have us afraid of WORDS!  They have us where they need us.

We were raised on Nirvana and Pearl Jam; we are better than this.  We know not to trust the government; we were raised to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE. We are better than this! I am not interested in a $1,400 stimulus check while the lobbyists get millions.  I don’t want to argue about a minimum wage; I am tired of living in a rigged system!  I am tired of working hard and investing my money in a system that is designed to feed me scraps and try to make me beg for a $1,400 stimulus check, while the wealthy dominate the world.  I’m not interested in being told I should be happy with a 6% gain in the stock market, while their gain is infinite.  I’m tired of owning a stock who gets a great earnings report yet the price falls, only to read it’s falling because all of the “shorts.”  They have the audacity to say, “we should not gamble with our own money, we should let the trading be done by the professionals.”  I suppose they do have a valid point; we are gambling with our money because we are entering into a rigged system where we are not being given the true rules.

It is time you join the battle for the biggest wealth transfer in the history of mankind.  It is time to buy AMC and HOLD ‘til it hits $1000.  Is this a sure thing, no, because once again we are entering a rigged system where the true rules are hidden from us.  But they are SCARED.  They are scared their propaganda is not working. They are scared we may stop hating each other and notice what they are doing.  They are scared we might be able to pay of our mortgages, live debt free, provide a future for our children without their help, and what can they shackle us with then?  Where is their power if we don’t care about a stimulus check or the minimum wage, because we have RISEN?  It is time to fight for your freedom, and all you have to do is hold ‘til $1000.",GEN-X...it is time...,1.0,1615547475,Intrepid-Pilot-5878

Goonies, it is time to RISE UP.  It is OUR TIME to rule.  It is time to shake off the hate they have tried to instill in us and divide us with over the last four years. It is time to remove our shackles from the propaganda machine.  It is time to stop believing the lies being spread in the media.  If you still believe what you are seeing and reading in the news, it is time to WAKE UP.  This has never been more evident than now, with how the news is trying to manipulate the AMC and GME stock coverage.  Have you never wondered where the news talking points, we are fed 24 hour a day, come from?  These talking points come from the same people who OWN the Media, OWN the Federal Reserve, OWN the majority of stock shares, and OWN our congress members.  We were raised to be freethinkers; yet they have us afraid of WORDS!  They have us where they need us.

We were raised on Nirvana and Pearl Jam; we are better than this.  We know not to trust the government; we were born to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE. We are better than this! I am not interested in a $1,400 stimulus check while the lobbyists get millions.  I don’t want to argue about a minimum wage; I am tired of living in a rigged system!  I am tired of working hard and investing my money in a system that is designed to feed me scraps and try to make me beg for a $1,400 stimulus check, while the wealthy dominate the world.  I’m not interested in being told I should be happy with a 6% gain in the stock market, while their gain is infinite.  I’m tired of owning a stock who gets a great earnings report yet the price falls, only to read it’s falling because all of the “shorts.”  Then they have the audacity to say, “we should not gamble with our own money, we should let the trading be done by the professionals.”  I suppose they do have a valid point; we are gambling with our money because we are entering into a rigged system where we are not being given the true rules.

It is time you join the battle for the biggest wealth transfer in the history of mankind.  It is time to buy AMC and HOLD ‘til it hits $1000.  Is this a sure thing, no, because once again we are entering a rigged system where the true rules are hidden from us.  But they are SCARED.  They are scared their propaganda is not working. They are scared we may stop hating each other and notice what they are doing.  They are scared we might be able to pay of our mortgages, live debt free, provide a future for our children without their help, and then what can they shackle us with then?  Where is their power if we don’t care about a stimulus check or the minimum wage, because we have RISEN?  It is time to fight for your freedom, and all you have to do is hold ‘til $1000.",GEN-X...it is time...,1.0,1615548015,Intrepid-Pilot-5878

44,m3fjf6,"So i recently got into investing. Im quite new in this whole thing and have a couple of questions.

first of im from germany so my ""investment english"" might not be the best, i will try my best to explain what im talking about.

I learned that when you own a share of a company you of a very slim portion of that company.

then i saw some stock being as cheap as 2 - 0.1 cents (€).

for example 

[PLCS.NO](https://PLCS.NO)

i do not understand how that works. like obviously if a company goes bankrupt the stock dies i assume. but how can a stock be as cheap as that one? cant you just basically buy the whole company then for like i dont know 10.000€ or something like that?

can a stock go to 0.0000000€ without the company dieing? which would mean you could then buy the whole company for free?

i just dont understand how that works.

Today, thanks to the meme stocks we love, I paid off the $13,000 high interest credit card burden, with over $40,000 remaining in long term investments.

I went through this already. People keep thinking ""he has nothing to lose"" because he he's a millionaire already. You know what he has to lose? The MILLIONS that he and all of us individual investors will be losing if we sell low. Literally nothing has changed since 40 dollars a share, but the insane amount of fuckery that's going on. It's quite impressive.

When in doubt just remember the 3:

1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based and run on profits. Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. 

2. Now that that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you need and want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials coughmedia. Believe this however you want. 

3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some HF was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr. DFV. 

This is not financial advice. Just what keeps me going easily throughout the days with all this shillfuckery. 

TLDR: Nothing has changed since 40 a share, it makes way more sense for DFV to pivot his investment strat to sell high. Read up on true DDs, make your own decisions. This is mine.

2. Shrimp used to only live in the ocean and now this company (technically a biotech company?) is growing them everywhere. Mostly in tanks and shit.
