# Purpose

The purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?

\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Fundamental Constraint

&amp;#x200B;

[The Underbanking Map](https://preview.redd.it/vpf82nkta1n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08837c21faf22549f3bfa8292a6fece047f9b4cd)

This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It‚Äôs going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

&amp;#x200B;

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you‚Äôre able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img shluc14va1n61...*

Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)

It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

# The Underbanked

Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

&amp;#x200B;

[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)

Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

\- Cash App‚Äôs Twitter and advertising strategy

&amp;#x200B;

[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)

&amp;#x200B;

[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)

\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching ‚ÄúCash App vs. Venmo‚Äù. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

&amp;#x200B;

[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square‚Äôs youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You‚Äôve heard it before, ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?‚Äù. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

1. The ability to start a business
2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
3. The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
4. The ability to save on basic purchases
5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

&amp;#x200B;

[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)

What this inevitably means is that we probably won‚Äôt even see Square operating at ‚Äúfull-force‚Äù until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

# Speculation

This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:

1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank‚Äôs regulatory offerings.
2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.
5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
6. Square will foray into equal housing.
7. Square will improved loan systems.
8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.

31,m50pkn,"I believe that $ROOT price is way too low because of the \~70% SI now. And, there have been many advocates for short squeezing $ROOT lately. Here are some posts relating to the SI that I found interesting: [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m32o5p/root_compared_to_gme_root_dd/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltszy8/story_and_dd_on_root_inc_root_the_unknown_sibling/). 

But, I'm going going to hold it for 5yrs+, and here is my (long-term) analysis to add to the reasons for the short squeeze:

**Now:** the price drop is partly due to the GAAP revenue drop. But, again, if you look closely, I think they have this under control. They have control over how much of their premium is going to the reinsurer vs their company's pocket as GAAP revenue. They could maintain the same level of revenue to retain us, shareholders. Yet, they (hopefully) intentionally let their GAAP revenue drop by 50% knowingly they would anticipate the stock price drop. So, I think they are really thinking long-term with this action.

After all, they got plenty of cash already from the overpriced IPO. even though they're burning cash, it will probably allow them to sustain for at least a few years.

**Short-term:** 2021Q1 and 2021Q2 are probably going to be the same with their reinsurance treaty. GAAP revenue will drop if we compare YoY; more people (and maybe algotrade bots) will find this news negative and maybe unwittingly bearish. Personally, I'm going to long Root now anyway.

**Medium-term:** With everything opening up after COVID, they would be able to pump up that marketing spends and get their premium up again as a tech-driven company.

**Ultra long-term:** Root's so-called ""flywheel"" is technically an endless virtuous cycle that not only captures 'good drivers, but 'all drivers'. Imagine a hypothetical scenario that all the good drivers now use Root. There will be only bad drivers left and the remaining insurance companies will have to raise their rate to cover their increased loss ratio. Root then again could penetrate the remaining less bad drivers by offering them the next level of the cheaper price. This could go on until all drivers convert to Root.

&amp;#x200B;

**The most important assumption: their ability to detect good vs bad drivers:** Telematics has been used by ZenDrive to detect driving patterns and collisions with better accuracy. Zendrive has been here for longer and has collected more mobile telematics data. I will assume that once Root has got enough data, they would be able to achieve a similar level of accuracy, thereby, reducing the loss ratio. The key assumption is that their Data Science Team is good enough to tackle this driver rating problem using telematics. Regardless, I'd like to think, with that amount of cash they got from the overpriced IPO, they would eventually attract more people to improve their telematics driver rating algorithm.

**TL; DR:** It's a typical high-risk, high-reward recently IPO company. But, to add to other short squeeze posts, I believe the price is way too low for the current risk. The financial statements might look bad, but I strongly feel the Management knows exactly what they are doing and are in control.

Is there any stocks I should add to my watchlist? With 2,800 stocks being traded on the NYSE, it is hard to know everything about all of them. 

I‚Äôm thinking once I get my gains from AMC and GME after the squeeze, to reinvest 50% of the gains into other quality stocks/dividend stocks, and select an ETF as well. 

$GUSH has had a 209% run up in the last 12 months. 93% in just the last 3 months. This is an oil ETF with insane gains since Biden‚Äôs election. Much like other oil companies. $GUSH in 2015 was worth 21k per share. Not sure what exactly happened to $GUSH and why it fell from Grace. If anyone knows anything about this, please do enlighten me.

$CCIV I know has that merger soon and looks to be possibly one of the best investments for EOY gains. 

$RBLX I believe is extremely overvalued and will deflate once a pop in price occurs due to the nature of most IPO listings. Currently waiting for that pop to bottom out and then buy in.

$SNAP has been doing amazing things as a company and I would not be shocked if snap was valued at 100$ EOY or EOY 2022.

$CPNG ‚Äúthe Korean Amazon‚Äù just popped on the market last week. No options currently available. Thinking this will bleed for another week before bottoming out at 30-35$ a share. Currently looking to possibly be in a bidding war with Lotte for South Korean EBay this Tuesday (if I remember correctly).

$NIO I believe is still a long term hold before it explodes. Biden mending trade ties with China (not that I think he should) could benefit NIO a lot by the EOY 2021. 

$IPOF I still do not know much about. My buddy told me to check them out but just haven‚Äôt had the time. If anyone knows anything about this, please do enlighten me.

86,m50zgd,"I'm hoping someone who is better at TA can chime in here, but I read a post indicating that both VWAP and VMA indicators can be used to identify a large drop in price without volume, i.e., shorts shorting. I've applied them to my charts and it seems to do just that. During the attack on the 10th these indicators barely budge even though the price drops significantly. You'll want to use VWAP at a smaller duration, e.g., 1 or 3 minutes, as I believe it's more accurate at these levels. Don't use it with anything higher.

Also, don't be completely reliant on it. Shorts have their tricks and no doubt have shares and as such can likely create volume by actually selling shares normally, buying puts so that MMs need to hedge, etc.

In the end, buy/hold, but you might want to take a look at these indicators. It's interesting to see essentially proof of what's going on via TA.","Ways to use TA to identify a massive short sale or ""Flash Crash""",1.0,1615746948,Piccolo_Alone
