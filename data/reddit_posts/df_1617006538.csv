Welcome to Archegos Capital Management! 

At a time when the role and practice of Wall Street is questioned by many, we stand firm in the belief that a strong investment industry is vital for human flourishing.  Good investors support the growth of exceptional companies, thereby bringing forth innovative products and services to benefit the world.  As a frequent traveler to Africa, it‚Äôs easy to see the impact of investing in the provision of healthcare, on the one hand, and the availability of mobile technology, on the other.  Both change, and enhance, the lives of people in their local communities. Corporations are changing our world to meet the challenges of an ever growing population while, at the same time, increasing the standard of living for all.  There is so much more to be done and we consider it a privilege to provide capital to those companies that will lead this global transformation.

In business, and the financial markets, ethical behavior does not just happen.  It has to be fostered.  Responsible market participants are critical to the functioning of efficient markets.  They help ensure, over time, that corporations are fairly valued in the public markets.  This is important because overvalued stocks harm investors, many of whom might be individuals relying on their investment portfolio to fund their retirement. Conversely, undervalued companies squeeze management teams of financing and human capital, reducing the likelihood that needed products and services come to market.  Archegos believes we contribute to making the markets more efficient and equitable.

As we take our market responsibilities seriously, we are also committed to creating a healthy corporate culture within the firm, by which individuals can grow and thrive.  You will see in our Mission Statement that we want to be known for growing people professionally.  Normally, firms use human assets to achieve their purpose.  For Archegos, our people are an important part of our purpose.  In addition we have a very explicit corporate culture that focuses on learning, doing and teaching, all in a caring environment of service to each other.  We work together collaboratively and encourage each other while sharpening our thinking and deepening our convictions about our investment ideas.  We believe there is a direct correlation between productive and motivated investment professionals and great investment results.

Please enjoy our website.  Thank you!

Intel Government subsidized foundry plant. Meant to DIRECTLY compete with TSMC

Current plans for INTEL. Remember, NVIDIA is priced to what its FUTURE price is not what its current valuation is.

There is a  article I cant post titled Be Fearful when others are greedy

  Quotes from article

* Intel is a very solid company that has a better growth track record than most give it credit for.
* The company's underlying performance has been very reliable over the last five years, and the company hit new record results in 2020.
* Share prices and underlying results do sometimes not seem tied too closely, which allows investors to exploit irrational market movements.
* Buy when shares are a bargain due to the market's (oftentimes excessive) worries.

As well as this excerpt

There were big ups and downs in Intel's share price, which can't be explained by the underlying financial results the company generated. Instead, these major up and down moves in Intel's share price can be described by valuation changes that were, I believe, primarily driven by news items that do not necessarily have a direct financial impact",So intel is gonna RIP.

I know we are in GME CAUSE WE LOVE THE STOCK, but here is just another thought on STPK. It is merging somewhere in q1 with STEM. It has gone down together with all other tech stocks but i just want to see if you guys are with me on it or not. I see potential and a 200% upside for this stock all the way to its ATH and above. We have our critical support levels at 24 and 20 which I believe will be respected, Just want to hear your thought and if you are with me on it. My portfolio is now roughly 60% gme, 25%pltr and 15% STPK, lets make some cash together on this stonk. Make sure to do your own analysis tho cause i just like eating crayons, especially green crayons.

Made a quick mashup of the tendieman acapella and the 220 kid tiktok remix of Wellerman.

I really liked the tiktok remix but just couldn't handle that it had the wrong lyrics!

I'm terrible at editing though, so if anyone can help me make this more on-beat and perhaps better mixed and mastered, please feel free to contact me (tried to just upload the project but didn't seem to be allowed).

Of course tons of credit and tendies to  u/quigonshin for the amazing lyrics, and anyone who helped create the original!",Tendieman edm remix,1.0,1617014321,MARTlN

**Who is $VIAC?**

ViacomCBS Inc. is a global media and entertainment company. It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon &amp; Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market.

**Why the selloff?**

This is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock.

Why the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble.

""Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos‚Äôs New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn‚Äôt returned."" -Someones in the shit in my opinion..

[https://www.ft.com/content/1b9119b2-0d8b-4a9d-b0a2-d10a021cd71b](https://www.ft.com/content/1b9119b2-0d8b-4a9d-b0a2-d10a021cd71b)

**Fundamentals**

Their total revenue has declined the last two years from 2019 27.8B to 2020 25.2B, but shall spike up again to 27.79B this year. In comparisons to another media giant $DISCA which is trading at 41.9 right now, but only has a revenue estimate of 11.87B this year and didn't look too good in its past years of 2020 with 10.6B and 2019 with 11.1B. Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2.

I also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. 

**TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued. As some hedgie is in the shit we are offered a delicious stock on a silver platter.**
