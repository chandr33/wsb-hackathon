24,mgn11k,"Curious to see what this community thinks about $SURF (Surface Oncology). They have a data readout (April 10th) for two of their preclinical drugs and a cash runway through 2023 (see 10K filed on March 10th). 

Background: So here's the back ground, on March 10th management beat earnings projections and the stock sky rocketed in the next two weeks from a low of $6.70 (ish) to a high of $9.60 (below January high of $14). Since then, nothing has happened. One of their preclinical's received orphan drug designation (different than receiving FDA approval, so don't get it twisted). That gives them access to (a) tax credits and (b) exclusivity. 

Options play: As a brief disclaimer, I own shares in SURF. I do not own options tho. But if I was looking to get diamond hands overnight, I would strongly consider the April 16th options at the $7.50 strike price. At a price per option of $.55, you would be sitting at 300% profit if the strike price goes up to its $9.60 (near term, March high). If it went close to its 52 week high ($14), you would be approaching nearly 1000% profit.

Short Interest: the stock has seen a pretty dramatic rise in short interest in March, which should make it prime for a squeeze. 

Risk: I think there's a decent amount of risk in bio tech in general, but here, with the reward being 2x for good data and the possibility of buy out (in October, they hired an investment bank to pursue buyouts - didn't end up happening because rumor has it SURF wanted more money, good sign if you understand anything about corporate law legal duties).",$SURF - rising short interest &amp; positive near term catalyst? 2x or higher returns?,1.0,1617130114,ATXStudent1990

34,mgn3l2,"As many know our sexy president sleepy Joe has come out and said he is getting rid of all private prisons. This peaked my retarded brain so much so that I have been doing research on private prisons specifically GEO group for way too long and I‚Äôm writing this abomination at 2 in the morning. Now on face value GEO looks like the biggest piece of garbage on the market at the moment but if you sift through the diarrhea I think you‚Äôll find a little kernel of corn you can nibble on.

**Why I‚Äôm bullish on GEO**

* **ICE and the surge of migrants**

GEO doesn‚Äôt just deal with private prisons, they provide holding facilities for ICE. Matter of fact majority of GEO‚Äôs revenue comes from ICE providing 22% of their income. It‚Äôs been in the news recently about the new surge of people that have been crossing the border there has been a 38% increase from January to February alone and 400% increase from April to February. Facilities are completely overcrowded with some places being over 700% over capacity. Supply and Demand baby.

* **GEO is being shorted to shit**

In the month of February there has been a 37% increase in short sales with a short float percentage of 28% as of 2/26/21 that number is most likely going to increase in March. For people who are equally retarded as me anything over 20% is extremely high and a float above 40% we are entering GME territory‚Ä¶

* **MICHAEL FUCKING BURRY**

My future dad Dr. Burry has hammered GEO and CXW hard in recent 13-F filing GEO:845,000 shares CXW: 1,000,000 shares. These are some of his largest positions in the form. Maybe he thinks it‚Äôs the next GameStop maybe he likes mass incarceration. Who knows who cares, all I know is if Burry is in I‚Äôm in.

* **Prisons aren‚Äôt closing**

Let me rephrase that, not all prisons are closing. The president doesn‚Äôt really have control over prisons at the state level and there are states and towns that are telling the president to essentially eat dick, because these prisons provide lots of jobs and money to these low income communities. GEO has retained 84% of their contracts so far this year and last year only down 11% from the previous year. It‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs not bad either.

* **Stable profitability** 

Despite the rough year of revenue due to Covid GEO managed to be surprisingly to stable with an above average ROE of 16.58% (nearly doubling CXW), plenty of cash on hand as well to maneuver. GEO seems they can stand through some of the hardships   

* **My wife‚Äôs boyfriend went to prison** 

He‚Äôs the coolest! (nice guy,huge cock). He said prison was so much fun, like having a sleepover with your friends every night! I don‚Äôt know about you but that sounds awesome. So not everyone thinks it‚Äôs the worst.

Alright that‚Äôs about it for now thank you for listening to my Ted talk. Also none of you fucks better complain ‚Äú I can‚Äôt believe you would a support a company like this?!?!?‚Äù. You can suck my dick, you wanna get mad at someone get mad at the government that imprisons them. In the words of ICE-T don‚Äôt hate the playa, hate the game.

41,mgn5qd,"By now we have all seen the things Cathy put in her new space exploration ETF from obvious inclusions like KTOS and LHX to head scratchers John Deere to Netflix and her own 3D printing ETF. Obviously the fund is actively managed so new companies will be acquired, reweighted, and blah blah blah. What follows is a few companies I can see being added at some point.

**Northrop Grumman (NOC)** \- I was admittedly surprised not to see NOC in the holdings for ARKX. They are LMT's little brother who has their own impressive portfolio of government contracts and military vehicles. They have also been making acquisitions to pivot towards Space. In 2017, they bought Orbital ATK and used that to form NG Innovative Systems. With that acquisition, NOC acquired multiple rockets, engines, and Space Payloads. Government contracting is very West Virginia-y and NOC already has existing ties to every defense company in ARKX. Notice, LMT just bought Aero(tyne)jet Rocketdyne to furhter build out their space capabilities. If you look at their earnigns release, NOC grew its Space Systems division 18% from $7.4B to $8.7B from 2019 to year end 2020. Those numbers should continue to grow as the government seeks a number of space capabilities.

**Raytheon (RTX)** \- Another classic American company connected to the teet of the USG. Raytheon Missiles have been sending people to the Gulag long before it was cool to do in Warzone. Like NOC and LMT, RTX has also made strategic space acquisitions, acquiring small sat company Blue Canyon Technologies in addition to owning Collins Aerospace. In its first year, RTX Intelligence &amp; Space division had $10.8B in net sales and 9.4% profit margin while Collins Aerospace had $19.2B in net sales and a 7.6% operating profit margin. Feels worth noting, Collins Aerospace literally makes fucking [space suits](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Space/Space-Suits) along with other critical spacecraft components. the Intelligence and Space division will continue to rack up prime contracts with the USG and sub contracts with all the other players in the Space sector and revenues will grow.

**Maxar (MAXR)** \- This company can best be described as LHX-lite as they have pivoted from a satellite imagery and consulting provider to becoming a company that makes boxes and things that will enter Space. MAXR actually has [some of its tech](https://blog.maxar.com/space-infrastructure/2021/inside-perseverance-how-maxar-robotics-will-enable-a-historic-mars-mission) on the Perseverance Rover exploring Mars right now. Additionally they are providing power and propulsion elements for the NASA Lunar Gateway project. Their 2020 annual hasn't been released yet, but the 2019 report highlighted contract wins and their development of their Space Infrastructure business in the mil/gov space. The company is still finding its way as it [reported a loss](https://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Maxar-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx) on 1.7B in revenue in 2020.  Growth in the previously mentioned Space Infrastructure division helped pair down the company's overall losses. Its most notable bit of news lately has been the [failure](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/sirius-xm-satellite-sxm-7-fails-built-by-maxar-and-launched-by-spacex.html) of it's satellite built for Sirius XM that was launched by SpaceX. If you invested in zero and pre-revenue EV companies, this is the play for you.

There are additional speculation plays you could make in a number of SPACS with BlackSky, Momentus, and SpaceX junior (Rocket Labs). Not going into further detail cause they have &lt;1B market cap.

I would note that these companies along with the other ones like LHX, LMT, HO, BA, KTOS etc will have big revenues but slimmer profit margins due to the complexities of putting shit into space and government contract restrictions on contract profits so you won't see the large PE ratios of software/tech companies. None of these are get rich quick stonks so patience will be required.

**TL;DR: ARKX has some questionable holdings now. Buy shares of these companies that could see an ARK boost.**
