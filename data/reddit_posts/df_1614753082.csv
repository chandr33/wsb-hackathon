50,lwnfwh,"Alright so let me start off by mentioning that i'm a long time lurker, first time poster in WSB, and thought it time to make my first contribution. I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.

I first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.

**ENTER COSTCO**

I then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd

There must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)

**Researching Possible Causes**

Could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106

Was there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.

Then I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things

**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**

https://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html

Well, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.

https://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html

Here's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18

As you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.

So I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3

Each blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a

As you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?

**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**

Looking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.

&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.

https://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html

And looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.

https://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/

The most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)

**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**

**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**

&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3﻿ The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4﻿  
&gt;  
&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.

**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**

Continuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.

**They are international (also making tendies):**

&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.

https://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774

**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**

&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.

https://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx

Costco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.

**My Plan:**

I like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.

edit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.

edit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!).","COSTCO, no really. When you need a profitable place to land after jumping from the tech train.",0.88,1614753962,bcell4u
