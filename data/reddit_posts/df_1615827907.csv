Positions, no concrete idea honestly, when I do my taxes I guess I'll find out.  


Really all my gains were last year, couple of buckets  
Tesla bought around 200 before the split and such  
Bought some 2022 Ford Calls when it was 6$  
Blindly followed a bunch of posts on WSB (won some, lost some)  
Microsoft  
Google  
Some money dumped into dividend stuff like Energy Transfer and Stag Industrial  
Did some s-p-a-c stuff last last year.  
Bought gamestop early, but not enough (200 shares) still have 165 (covered my investment, sue me)  
Lost money on every FD option, but only bought a few  
Have \~30% of funds all over Cathie Woods' adventures.  
Have \~10% in marijuana stuff

Tomorrow technically was the lowest point of my portfolio, but the 420.69% was too nice to not post.  Here Is my 1 year.

Stop buying OTM calls. You are just handing money to MMs who are then using it to suppress the price.

Buy  ITM calls or as close as you can. If you're thinking about buying 5x 800C for this week, buy 1x 300C instead. The 300C will cause them to delta hedge and buy some shares. The 800C is just handing them free money and they will likely not hedge it at all, or very minimally, until the price is  500/600. But it won't get there because you're handing them ammo to keep it below 300.

If you can only afford 1x 800C, then please just buy a share instead. They're about the same  price and buying the share *helps* where buying the 800C *ACTIVELY HURTS THE PRICE*. Also you shares don't expire. 

If you dump your stimmy into  800C this week you might as well just write Citadel a $1400 check and  mail it to them. It's not coming back. 

\*\*\* MID POST PSA \*\*\*

If you need that stimmy for rent or bills or food, please please please don't YOLO it into the stock market. Take care of yourself and don't throw away your lifeline.

\*\*\* END MID POST PSA \*\*\*

I know we all want this to moon right now but it's very unlikely we'll see 800 EOW. If we don't, then every single 800C bought was just free money for MMs. The OI on the 800C for this week is already at 40,862. Assuming they were bought for an average of $250 that's over $10 million that the MMs get for free to use to keep the price down, knowing they don't really need to hedge it because you gave them the means to avoid it from becoming ITM.

By buying ITM or ATM calls you set yourself up to profit when that call expires ITM and also help create upward pressure to establish new price floors.

tl;dr

* Buy ATM or ITM calls if you can.
* If you can't do that, buy calls *nearest* to ITM as you can. 300C, etc.
* If you can't do that, then buy shares. Shares still help!!!!

58,m5po76,"Manually crossposting from another sub:

Struggling to interpret DFV's tweet of a black hole? The man is brilliant, and here's why:

A ""Liquidity Black Hole"" is a well-studied economic phenomenon. In a liquidity black hole, short-term traders exit their position in a security in anticipation of other short-term traders exiting their own positions in the security in the immediate future. Each short-term trader tries to exit their position before every other short-term trader, and must exit as fast as they can. To do so, they take liquidity from the other side of the market (like executing a market order instead of placing a limit order). This evaporates liquidity from the other side of the market, ""gapping"" the market against those short-term traders.

What makes these traders short-term? i.e. why can't one of these traders just wait it out? Well stfu and let me tell you: a short-term trader is constrained by a loss limit—some price at which a trader must exit their position. What kind of traders have loss limits. Traders using credit (e.g. margin traders) or idiots who fall for setting stop-loss orders. This includes short sellers.

Examples of illiquidity black holes include the 1987 stock market crash, Wed's stop-loss raid on GME, and most importantly, the impending MOASS.

See as we all know, shorting a stock entails limited upside with unlimited downside. No one has unlimited money to lose, therefore every short seller has a loss limit making them a short-term trader at risk to liquidity black holes. There's a special name for this type of liquidity black hole: a short squeeze.

Delicious tears

Now you see why DFV's would tweet the black hole from a movie many of us know and love?

​

Tldr; DFV's tweet = incoming short squeeze. For all you apes that passed pre-algebra,

DFV's tweet - incoming short squeeze = 0, because DFV's tweet without an incoming short squeeze makes 0 sense. 🚀🚀🚀s on 🚀🚀🚀s on 🚀🚀🚀s.

7. Total outstanding shares is 1.61 Billion. Only 90.23 Million give or take is publicly traded. The remainder is institutionally owned. In short, only a fraction of the shares of the company are available for trading, that being 90.23 million.
8. Short interest is very high. Over the last 2 weeks, the short interest volume % has been between 28% - 31%. The latest short interest information from general market analysis companies are dated as of 02/26/2021, the most recent information for March isn't available yet. Short borrow rate fee is at %8.43 give or take. Don't forget this stock had a dividend payout on 03/09/2021 which is high at %4.82 (The shorts must cover that as well), so the potential for a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is very plausible, which is just another positive for us who invested in $UWMC.

9. Major market analyst rate $UWMC as a buy. UWMC insiders have bought more shares then sold in the past 3 months.
10. This is both a good short-term and long-term play. You can invest in this company for the possible short squeeze/gamma squeeze or for the long-term growth and for it to reach it's actual fair value, which, if you buy in now you should be in for a nice ride.

3m ago they were at $17 and some change
6m ago they were at $12
1y ago they were at $8
5y ago they were around $72 a share
