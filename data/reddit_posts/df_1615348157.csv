*disclaimer* i was afraid to transfer stocks to another broker, i got TDA but i just couldnt risk missing the squeeze or a spike to transfer, im moving there slowly, and have another 50 gme at 190avg!

Thanks to the retards here and some great DD that i out all my faith into, im up 150% for my total investments, and 50% from before i found the stock
 My position didnt always take up 75% of my portfolio, i originally bought 100 at 180 avg and when it tanked i evaluated my other stocks and sold ones that had profited enough from recovery and averaged down to 140! Recently paper handed 6 to transfer $ into my bank cause all my saving is in the market now..
My older brother was telling me to sell at 130 and 150 and just run but i told him i cant be a paper handed bitch. Glad i didnt give in

From [the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sintx-technologies-announces-fabric-technology-140000238.html) this morning… 

&gt;SINTX Technologies announced today announced test results showing that fabrics containing SINTX’s silicon nitride continue to demonstrate inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus upon contact. Earlier tests had shown that sintered silicon nitride powders reduced viral loads by as much as 99.9%, starting at one minute after exposure to silicon nitride.

That’s correct, you just read that fabrics (e.g. masks, lab coats, surgical gowns, etc.) containing SINTs magic sauce RIPs COVID-19 upon contact… That’s a big deal.

Over the past month SINT has slowly fell because it was a victim of the overall dump the market was taking. Less than a month ago it was well over $3 and that was before this ridiculous news.

SINT jumped 40% at open and then steadily climbed more throughout the day and afterhours. Its currently up 58%, but here’s the great thing… it’s still only $2.86 with lots of room to run. The Goku Spirit Bomb is just now starting to build.

The chef’s kiss is the MACD/RSI/Stochastics looks beautiful even after todays gains… I wouldn’t be surprised if it hit $5 tomorrow.

27,m1oqru,"Sorry for the sad story here, but I felt compelled to share... 

Last year my parents, who live across the country, wanted to get me a PS5 for Christmas, but it's been impossible to order. So they sent me the money for one and told me to let em know when I bought it. Been trying since November to track one down with no luck. I refused to buy from scalpers, so I futilely kept refreshing tabs of every big retailer looking for restocks.

Enter the GME. I fomo'd in on Jan 27th, and we all know what happened next. I was livid like every other ape here. Been holding since 378, averaging down to 206. I believe in Gamestop's turnaround and want to help the cause, so I signed up for their rewards program and vowed to shop all my gaming needs from them here on out. It payed off today when a notification for a ps5 pre-order opportunity popped up, and I luckily got my order in. Between that and the stonk, it's been a good start to the week.

Now the sad part. In early February my dad passed away due to complications with covid. I hadn't seen him in person since Christmas 2019. It's been a rough month for me and my family. But it has helped me get perspective on how much less important any monetary gains or losses are compared to time with those you love.

So today was bittersweet. I took a step toward fulfilling the last Christmas present I'll ever get from my dad. And hopefully incoming tendies will make it easier for me to  visit my mom more frequently.

Good luck and good health to everyone. WSB has been a welcome distraction the past month, so thanks for that.",Final Christmas gift from my father,1.0,1615348519,Accomplished_Suit651

34,m1orgc,"When I was growing up ~~in Bulgaria,~~  I was never really interested in stocks or investing, nor did anyone go out of their way to try to teach me about it.

The only exposure I ever really got to the market was ""Securities Fraud"" this, ""Ponzi Scheme"" that....

...and the only thing I was ever really taught about the stock market in school was this cool SOX act they passed... you know, the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002. 

It sought to reform 4 things:

1. Corporate responsibility
2. Increased criminal punishment
3. Accounting regulation
4. New protections

All in the name of protecting **investors** from fraudulent financial reporting by **corporations**.

Cool.

The second and only other fact retained from High School: 

""its all enforced by the SEC, an independent federal agency""

Ok... cool.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, now ARMED WITH KNOWING THESE TWO FACTS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET, I was able to ace my economics exam, and move on with Life.   

I was sure that the fraudulent days of the stock markets were over, this Flawless Golden System where the SEC enforces the laws and holds corporate greed accountable to Protect The Investors!

Perfect. Except, its fucking not when you realize there's a single point of failure in an independent agency that has complete control over WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE WHY and HOW it ENFORCES OUR LAWS.

We need the laws enforced.

58,m1ow80,"I’m thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I’m doing my DD as I type this up.
Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....
Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.
So let’s try to figure out Operating Expenses...
7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated. But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I’m a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf More on him and the infrastructure later.
So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives
Ok, let’s low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ ) minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.
They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401
953 non exec employees. Some are in China, some make more than others. Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let’s estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year. That’s another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.
$332.83 million estimated left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.
Data Center + migration costs. Back to Dan Williams. His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers. AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive. My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020. This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic). Roblox wouldn’t have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site. At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year. Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.
The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part. Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS. Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.
But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth. I also don’t know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.
I’m gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs. $586.13 million minus that very rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).
And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills.
I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn’t even be going public. Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume. Look at Steam...
So, long term:
Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming). They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.
I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue. I didn’t fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

71,m1oynx,"  From [the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sintx-technologies-announces-fabric-technology-140000238.html) this morning…

&gt;{they} announced today test results showing that fabrics containing {their} silicon nitride continue to demonstrate inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus upon contact. Earlier tests had shown that sintered silicon nitride powders reduced viral loads by as much as 99.9%, starting at one minute after exposure to silicon nitride.

That’s correct, you just read that fabrics (e.g. masks, lab coats, surgical gowns, etc.) containing their magic sauce RIPs COVID-19 upon contact… That’s a big deal.

Over the past month it has slowly fell because it was a victim of the overall dump the market was taking. Less than a month ago it was well over $3 and that was before this ridiculous news.

It jumped 40% at open and then steadily climbed more throughout the day and afterhours. Its currently up 58%, but here’s the great thing… it’s still only $2.86 with lots of room to run. The Goku Spirit Bomb is just now starting to build.

The chef’s kiss is the MACD/RSI/Stochastics looks beautiful even after todays gains… I wouldn’t be surprised if it hit $5 tomorrow.

* As counterintuitive as it seems, purely monetary donations do not fix the issues that many charities try to tackle. In fact, especially in foreign aid situations, it can create an unhealthy dependence and destructive worldview for the people being helped. 
* It is important to give people dignity and empowerment instead of addressing purely the monetary side (but that is a good place to start as well!!!).  The book ""When Helping Hurts"" details this very well.
* **The point of this post is not to tell you you have to spend money on charity or to make you feel bad if you do or don't.** This is a pretty complex issue and I felt like it ought to be said. Paying off someone's loans, or debts, or blessing them monetarily can and has turned people's lives around, the long-lasting richness of life comes from meaningful relationship with people, which is what I think many of us have felt on this sub :)
* You already know this, look out for bad charities (low fundraising efficiencies, CEO's with large salaries can be an indicator, etc.) and if you do give to charity, it's good to find reputable ones, or **better yet local charity**. Now go and hold until the stock is so high until we can build a hospital out of Nintendo Switches. (pls come save me I bought @ $325)

Me: I started about 1 month ago when the price was relatively low and it's up to around 250 now. It's a really weird situation and I still think there is some room for it to go up even more.

Wife: You stupid ape! Why have you invested only so little into it? If you were to invest more we would gain so much more!
