Rocket Companies (NYSE: [RKT](https://www.streetinsider.com/stock_lookup.php?q=RKT)) declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share.

The dividend will be payable on March 23, 2021, to stockholders of record on March 9, 2021, with an ex-dividend date of March 8, 2021.

The annual yield on the dividend is 5.6 percent.

The company’s recent movement comes largely from the announcement by the US President Joe Biden that electric vehicles (EV) – and other green energy initiatives – will see massive investment worth billions of dollars.  Even better, President Biden stated he would be changing 650,000 federal vehicles into EVs. BlackBerry stock could rise as its QNX software remains at the forefront of autonomous vehicle use where security is a major issue.   

 I'd pay attention to 1) the chart action 2) evidence of increasing QNX adoption by automotive manufacturers  3) Low implied volatility on the options.  I’m long the stock via Jan 2022 25c
