5,m607vz,"Ok ladies, I am here to tell you of an opportunity. I am invested in this opportunity and this is not financial advice..
Imagine a company that is 28 X less in market cap and also has 100 X less position holders than its main competitor who produces the same content. This company who is much smaller and less known currently has gained a whopping 735% ROI. If you put $100 into this beast last month you would have $73,600 today. Investing in this last month and today it‚Äôs main competitor is still 28X more market cap and has 100X the holders. There is still huge room to grow here. And the most important feature in this company is that this companies shares are decreasing every single minute of every day. This company is not a company though, this is the comparison of hoge coin vs doggy coin. Welcome to hoge finance. 

Hoge coin - it‚Äôs doggy but defi. Before I go any further I want to explain the two 

Doggy coin:
-7 year old meme coin (49 in dog years)
-2.8 million holders
-Worth 5 cents a coin
-Over 7 billion market cap
-Top 15 coin based on marketcap 
-daily trading volume of over 1.7 million (this is important)
-128 billion coins in circulation and increasing (5 billion a year)

That is doggy coins biggest weakness. 5 billion new coins a year means in order for it to grow they would have to add billions of dollars and that is going to be tougher and tougher every year. If that volume doesn‚Äôt continue to grow, doggy will be worth less and less every year. 

Here enters hoge:
Hoge coin - also a meme token, but a meme token on steroids. 

-7 weeks old
-27,000 holders (up from less than 5,000 holders last week) 
-Worth currently .00076947
-Market cap of 323 million
-Barely anyone knows of this and difficult to buy. This is changing and will become easier and easier to buy. 
-roughly 30 million trading volume (2 million last week)
-420 billion coins in circulation and DECREASING. 

This is one of the first coins of its kind and is going to be a monster. The biggest reason is the community. Hoge Reddit, telegram, Twitter are the most enthusiastic and fanatic investors I have ever seen. Go check it out for yourself just search hoge and you will see. This coin is growing exponentially faster than anything I have ever invested in and it is still sooo early especially when comparing to doggy. 

Tokenomics:

This coin gets a 2% tax on every transaction. 1% of each trade buy and sell gets destroyed forever, another 1% gets distributed to everyone holding it. If you have diamond hands this coin is made for you baby. 
This coin has many things going other than the community. There was 1 trillion coins, 500 billion burnt for life right away. Now down to 420 billion in 7 weeks! This will slow down as the coin grows. 

$30,000,000 daily volume at .00075 coin price means 22.5 billion coins are trading a day. That means 225 million coins are destroyed a day and another 225 million coins given out. Even if this coins market cap stays the same as long as the community doesn‚Äôt just stop trading your coins will increase in numbers and in value. If this gets the same trading volume as doggy this is going to blastoff. This coin has also passed its audit. This is the easiest decision I ever made and I would highly suggest looking into the beast that is hoge finance.",Imagine a company that has an identical twin that is worth billions less for no reason,1.0,1615866205,Stanksniffer

**$ZDGE** \-- (The text below is straight from their prospectus. I just cut and paste the stuff that stood out to me. DYOR.)

# Vision:

Our vision calls for utilizing our Zedge app‚Äôs digital publishing platform to not only continue being one of the world‚Äôs leading mobile personalization content apps but to also use this platform to publish new stand-alone apps that extend our value proposition in entertainment. We have engineered the platform to support an array of digital content enabling us to launch new apps with relative ease and speed. We want to capitalize on our Zedge app‚Äôs existing large install base as well as organic search traffic across the web and in the app stores as a low-cost user acquisition channel for these new entertainment apps. Our goal is to ensure that these new apps are equally valuable and viable across both Android and iOS.

If we execute our vision, we would build a network of apps which can be used for cross-promotional purposes. We identified the entertainment market as our focal point for new apps because we believe that apps in that market:

* generally overlap well with the demographic of our Zedge app‚Äôs existing customer base;
* enjoy a higher frequency of use when compared to our Zedge app enabling the potential for both a subscription and ad-based monetization model; and
* allow for us to attract new users who may not be interested in our Zedge app‚Äôs personalization content.

# History:

1. In December 2006, IDT Corporation acquired 90% of Zedge.
2. In 2016, IDT Corporation spun off our stock to its stockholders, and our Class B Common Stock was listed on the NYSE
3. In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, our marketplace that is part of the Zedge app where artists and brands can market, distribute and sell to our users their digital content. . . .

# My Thoughts:

So... IDT spun-off it's application platform back in 2016, and it smashed earnings today. CEO talked about making acquisitions on the earnings call. Digital advertising + Backend Tech + Content Marketplaces + ***Expanding to Entertainment*** \+ Good Vision. Execution appears to be going well. Looks like a winner in my book.

They have done it. Something far more terrifying than any amount of Market manipulation or hate speech articles misrepresenting the sub. They have released their most powerful attack. The day I feared the most... the attack I assumed they where to sane to do, tendies will be ripped out from our mouths 

*I have seen entire companies reduced to nothing but soot and ash at the mere whisper of the word ""buy"" from Cramer.* 

*I've seen grand standing Goliath companies firm as pillars crumble down to rubble at a Cramer recommendation.* 

*I've seen the moon fall further faster and harder than Majoras Mask, all from a Cramer recommendation.  I have seen it. it is horrible, an absolute bloodbath.* 

Market caps halved, moons fallen, gains destroyed, land baron of trendies for miles across in any direction from where ever he was standing when he utters the deathly phrase from his accursed lips ""buy.""

The all to notorious Cramer recommendation. The final destination of a stock, the end of the line. It will not be a quick or painless death; this is the curse of strength that a stock as powerful as GME has to bear. GME will not go quickly or quietly in the night. It will not go peacefully. However the angel of death has already been released from the lips of the mad man and we do not have enough lambs blood to pacify it. 

Some of you may retreat, I will not judge you for that- seeing the stock go from 400 to 40 is one thing but... this... this horrific scene. It's too gut wrenching, a Cramer recommendation is far worse. 

Back in our darkest hour, when the sub was filled with nothing but thousands of shills... the only thing giving me hope was that Cramer was saying not to buy Gme. Even with nothing but the word sell being echo'd into my head at every turn Cramer saying not to buy was more than enough to buy and hold.  With the entire Financial system against us rigging itself at every turn, Cramer saying not to buy was enough to continue onward. 

This however... this is the death of hope.

At the time of posting this there is approximately xxxxxxxx apes online smashing buttons and sniffing their wife‚Äôs boyfriends ejaculate on their bedsheets, and that got me thinking (at whatever capacity an autist like myself can think at)

I‚Äôm in a sticky situation (having yolod all $300 of my life savings into GME) but so is a shockingly high percentage of my community due to the way this pandemic has obliterated local economies, leaving a substantial amount of under privileged kids, animals and family‚Äôs in general borderline fucked.

This is where you come in, yes you.

We‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs been accomplished with the Apes and animals this subs adopted, quite literally creating a primate army that has collectively a higher IQ than all of us put together.

So I figured shit, I don‚Äôt really have anything to offer but my ability to do heinous shit, so I was thinking why don‚Äôt I take the debts other folk have abandoned (such as drinking their own piss) and do them myself but with the catch that y‚Äôall all donate at the least $1 each so I can buy food for local families and also buy myself a lambo and Tesla because fuck you and fuck my ex wife.

But instead of just drinking my own piss why don‚Äôt I create tiers of awards like if we for example raised x amount of money I‚Äôd;

- tattoo whatever this sub votes for on me at various sizes

-shave my head to look like Jim Cramer 

-dress up as Jim Cramer and then get someone to peg me before I bombard him via Twitter with the video 

- get a WSB back piece

- dress up as a monkey and throw my shit at Melvin capitals offices 

And much much much more! 

I think I could be a fun way to bring us apes together whilst also doing something good for someone in our community and the community around us.

50,m60lky,"What is budget reconciliation?

* Budget reconciliation hasn‚Äôt been used much until around the last decade, but as partisanship has waxed to the extreme it has become the primary way to get policy done through the powers of the Senate and their exclusive control of spending/taxes. The House must also sign on. 

* BR can only happen once every fiscal year and cannot increase the budget deficit by a certain amount and so it‚Äôs limited. Because the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was the BR used by the previous administration for FY 2020, Biden has 2021 (which he‚Äôs just used) and 2022 (which he will use this year) and 2023 which he can use before the Senate and/or House could potentially change hands.

* Most importantly, BR requires a simple Senate majority.

Why does budget reconciliation matter now?

* Besides a response to extreme crises like the Great Recession and the pandemic which forced the two parties to work together, it‚Äôs been the only way to get policy done. Remember, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was done through BR when the GOP held the Senate and House.

* The filibuster: until the last few decades, policy was finalized through a simple majority vote in the Senate. The minority could filibuster for days on end to delay and potentially derail majority policy initiatives. This is no more. Now, even the threat of a filibuster means any traditionally-derived policy requires a 60% Senate majority to vote, and not a simple majority. This means little to nothing gets done unless a crisis or BR.

* With the threat of the Dems losing a slim and slimming majority in both houses in 2022 and the timing nature of BR, the time to go big is before 2023.

What does that mean for markets?

* So the next budget reconciliation will occur in late September and almost certainly be centered around infrastructure, but the process can start months ahead of then. A bipartisan bill will never see the light of day because of GOP Senate obstructionism, but at least we have a solid timeline for the next fiscal juice. 

* Because of the simple majority nature of budget reconciliation, a very small handful of moderate Dems (Manchin and Sinema primarily) can blow up the whole process, and so we‚Äôve seen the stimulus grand totals wane due to these two Senator‚Äôs fiscal responsibility virtue signaling. Markets expect that aspect of in-party fighting to continue and the next undoubtably infrastructure-centered fiscal policy to reflect that trend.

How could the next BR this year bring surprises?

* Fiscal stimulus during the pandemic started broad and has narrowed, but this doesn‚Äôt mean future fiscal policy will continue to narrow in regards to infrastructure.

* Infrastructure and energy has been ripping during this Biden administration in expectation of infrastructure investment, but prices don‚Äôt reflect a BR that wildly defies current lowering political expectations. 

* A $2T-$4T infrastructure bill signed off by moderate Dems that lands somewhere in the middle would surprise markets, and unleash a broad bullishness for future fiscal policy that‚Äôs been trending the other direction.",The power of budget reconciliation and what that means for markets (and how it could bring surprises),1.0,1615867552,chadimmaculate

78,m60und,"My thesis from a couple hours of research: These 4 are China based companies have seen there share prices drop 20-40% in the last three weeks (mostly because of the US ree announcement I think) but also because of the volatility of China retail investors. REMX has gone from $93 to $80 in this time (not nearly as big a drop). If these 4 companies show similar earnings like LYC.ax (another of REMX components) did, they are likely to recover that 20-40% and REMX could go back over $90. This is not investing advise, just an idea for discussion.","REMX rare earth elements etf, 4 of its largest components report their earnings in less than three weeks.",1.0,1615868495,socialmediahammer

Like many, it's been a decent year for me in the markets, and now I'm sitting on about $300,000 in cash post taxes. I have literally never touched traditional stock markets, mostly focusing on other things, but it's getting all so tiresome, so I've de-risked quite a bit.

Upon seeking advice on dividend yields, I was advised I should start funneling money into AT&amp;T over the next year. Seems like solid advice, but curious as to the hive-minds thoughts on splitting this into 3x $100K chunks for a long term growth investment.
