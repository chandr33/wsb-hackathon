0,m3grqp,"Does ASPL aka Wheels Up the private jet company have a future soaring? My DD that shows the potential of the stock. 

Below please find some information the SPAC $ASPL aka Wheels Up :

1. Kenny Dichter CEO sold his first jet company to Buffett
2. Existing revenues, going public to make a cleaner balance sheet
3. Delta $DAL holds 24%
4. Endorsers: Tom Brady, Robert Irvine, Serena Williams 
5. Rumors of partnerships with other luxury brands aka credit cards and Rolex
6. Enterprise value of $2.1 billion
7. Fantastic business model for a luxury brand, targeting high wealth individuals
8. Company has been well established in the industry and are now expanding into Middle East 
9. Pushing for new innovation and technology in the industry, they have also purchased competitors
10. Post COVID flying mindset for those who are wealthy instead of flying $AAL $LUV $UAL
 

Overall I think this is the future of flying for the wealthy. No longer will business CEO‚Äôs, athletes or celebrities be flying 1st class.  

Also they are a great charitable organization. Who creates ‚ÄúMeals Up‚Äù during covid to provide meals for those in need.

I've been too busy at work, *not that anyone cares*, and frankly there have been far better DDs out there than I could ever hope to write. Seriously, every time I doubted myself for holding on throughout this madness, your posts refortified these üíéüôå. Thank you.

**TL;DR**
I believe that Q420 earnings call, scheduled for March 23rd, is going to push GME to new ATHs. Not because of remarkable earnings (although this is not out of the realm of possibilities), but due to the guidance which we are about to receive at the earnings call.

.

By now, we've all heard ""omni-channel"" so many times that we're hearing it in our sleep. But what does it mean? Fucked if I know. However, I think Ryan Cohen is going to lay out proper, well-structured and clear plan for the coming months and years. **This** is going to be the thing to look out for during this earnings call. 

.

I saw a couple of weeks ago someone posted screenshots of high-end graphics cards finally being sold on the GameStop website. This lines up perfectly with what we've been hearing for  a couple of months regarding GameStop's entry into the PC Gaming market. Looking forward to hearing about those 1.5-tier build-your-own-PC stores, on the 23rd.

.

The current CFO gave his 30-day ""resignation"" notice on the 23rd of February. He will step down from his role on the 26th of March. The earnings call is on the 23rd. I believe by then (at the latest) we will hear who is going to take over his position in the company.

.

At the last earnings call, we learned from CEO George Sherman that GameStop filed for the *option* (this is important) to issue *$100 million dollars worth of stock* (also very important). I believed then, and still do, that this was to surpress any attempt of a hostile takeover by Cohen and his buddies, as Cohen was already sitting on almost 10% of the company's shares. It was Sherman's way of saying ""if you try some shit, I will dilute you back to &lt;10%. This is further evidenced by the fact that GameStop *still had the right to buy back shares*. Why the fuck would a company file to issue more shares whilst still holding the right to buy back shares? Cohen then went ahead and increased his GME position to the point that he couldn't possibly be diluted to below 10%, after with a new share offering. Cohen being Cohen (an Elon-tier memelord in the making), decided to own exactly **9,000,1**00 shares. Coincidence, I think the fuck not.


Still, let's consider a *potential* share offering, just for shits and giggles...


With the current CFO's ""resignation"", Cohen and his buddies being on the board of directors, and the immense love which we all have for the stock - I believe it's **highly** unlikely that GameStop will issue any more shares. Still, it cannot be ruled out completely so here's what would happen if GameStop *did* issue those shares.


Let's assume that the price stays at $250, as there seems to me tremendous support at this level.

$100,000,000 / $250 = 400,000 shares

**Yes, you read that right.**

At current levels, GameStop *could* raise $100m through an issue of only 400,000 shares.

At the current outstanding shares of ~70m, this would only dilute shareholders by **just over 1%**. Furthermore, this is **NOT** going to do shortsellers any favours in terms of finding enough shares to cover their positions and save them from the absolute shitstorm they have created.


Regardless, I do not think GameStop would want to lose *any* support from shareholders by issuing any shares, no matter how few.

.

If anyone would like me to add any other points for visibility, please let me know.

Preface - this is not suggesting you sell! It is to open discussion on protecting yourselves and planning for whatever happens next.

Lord Cohen, a true god amongst insects, has spoken once again. This time though, I see it as a friendly warning to retail traders like us. In fact I think this tweet was directly for us. What better character to represent WSB, a self-proclaimed community of retards and ne'er-do-wells, than Harry from dumb and dumber?

In the scene Harry had ingested the MOAL (mother of all laxatives), Turbo Lax, and had to expel an unprecedented amount of shit while he was a guest at a girls house. And my god it was not a smooth process. Here's what happened - when he first felt the shit knocking it hit him suddenly like a fucking brick wall. He quickly and desperately grasped around to find the bathroom door, where he voraciously dropped his pants and LET LOOSE. It was a euphoric, and almost orgasmic experience. The look on his face for about 5 seconds was that of pure pleasure. You know what I'm talking about. Once he was done, a look of horror came on his face as he realized where he was and the aftermath he would have to deal with. His effort to open the window was too little too late, and the toilet did not work. The look of horror on his face intensified as the scene began to cut to Lloyd's stupid face and evil laugh.

So what is this supposed to mean for GME holders? Well, I believe Cohen was trying to warn us retards to not be like Harry. When the GME hype quickly set in, much like a potent laxative, retards from all over the world scrambled (are still scrambling?) to quickly and almost desperately grab shares before the big ""explosion"". With the squeeze in motion, we will see pure euphoric pleasure as our assholes are ripped wide open by the most epic squeeze of our lifetimes. It will be easy to get caught up in this euphoria, with no regard for consequences or what happens next, until it is over. Once it is over, horror will be on the faces of the bagholders who are left with their shit all over the place while the evil laugh of those who profited is heard in the distance. This was seen with the last squeeze, as many people here bought at the top and were left holding at $40.

Let's be honest, we like to think RC knows everything that's going to happen and is trying to give us hints about what will happen next. I don't think this is true. While RC has a better idea than any of us, nobody knows what will happen next. The only thing that we do know for sure is if there is a massive squeeze, there will be massive bagholders left on the other side. RC knows this, and knows that at this time we are gamestop's biggest supporters. At this moment in time, we love gamestop (and like the stock). If we were to become bagholders, gamestop may forever be painted in a negative light and will have lost it's most loyal customer base. At the end of this, RC and gang wants retail to profit and continue their love for gamestop. I'm sure they would much prefer and slow and methodical rise with a slower more deliberate squeeze that will reward all shareholders. Instead of desperately grabbing the nearest doorknob to find the closest toilet, Cohen may be suggesting that you take your time to find a working toilet and slowly deliver a steaming hot deuce onto the faces short sellers.

How do you protect yourself here? What is the best strategy moving forward? Well, I leave that up to the retards in the comments. All I know is that we need to stay vigilant and be careful out there. Instead of YOLO'ing all my money in at once, I have been slowly adding shares to even out the volatility.

Obviously none of this is investment advice and his highly speculative. Honestly I just banged my head on a keyboard and this was the result. I do own GME shares and hope to for a long time moving forward.

Edit: tldr. Cohens latest tweet may be a warning in an effort to keep shareholders from becoming bag holders after a short squeeze. Harry had to deal with the unfortunate consequences of an epic squeeze because he did not plan ahead.

‚ÄúWe choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.‚Äù - JFK

This is just the start of the largest transfer of wealth the world will ever see.

**This is bigger than just GME and AMC.**

**Holding until the Free Market is Free.**

The selling of derivative after derivative of phantom shares needs to be accounted for across the entire board and paid in full.

**This is about EXPOSING the ""free market"" they control.**

Naked Short Selling - High-Frequency Trading - Dark Pools - Phantom Shares - Guided Algorithms

This must be stopped. This is not a ""Free Market."" This is **CRIMINAL** behavior supported by Janet yellen and the SEC.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-yellen/bidens-treasury-nominee-yellen-discloses-paid-speaking-gigs-for-financial-firms-idUSKBN2961ZO](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-yellen/bidens-treasury-nominee-yellen-discloses-paid-speaking-gigs-for-financial-firms-idUSKBN2961ZO)

Artificial pre and after market - fines with no transparency (fake numbers reports fines) -- Pattern Day Trading Laws - Settlement periods - **halting** trading of companies just because they feel like it -

SEC allowing hedgefunds to solely run on IBM Watson like software that specifies trade routing systems with data on **trading patterns** while also using that data to make their own trades for profit.

read that last line again.

That is how hedgefunds manipulate and control the ""**FREE MARKET**""

They play the upside and downside of trades, pin the price, and make money both ways by setting algorithms.

the manipulation - has been blatant, glaring and obvious

Hedgefund scare tactics we've seen thus far.

ladder attacks - manipulation of the entire market - synchronized market drops - bot attacks - reverse psychology bots - professional manipulators - stop loss raids - diversion tactics - silver - all the bs.

**DONT FORGET THEY CONTROL THE MEDIA**

[https://techstartups.com/2020/09/18/6-corporations-control-90-media-america-illusion-choice-objectivity-2020/](https://techstartups.com/2020/09/18/6-corporations-control-90-media-america-illusion-choice-objectivity-2020/)

Analysts paid to write shitty articles. ONE PENNY ha how much did that cost?

They never go to fucking jail. **1 guy** went to jail in 07/08 housing market collapse

How many more of these **Hedgefund Scandals** do we need until **ALL OF THE PEOPLE WAKE UP?**

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Time to shut down their ""free market"" and **Expose the Criminals.**

My favorite movie is Point Break. Ex Presidents will now expose the Hedgefund run ""Free Market""

My favorite President JFK.

Listen To **JFKs Speech about Secret Societies. The Time is Now.** This is a must watch 5 minute video.

**WE NEED FULL ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION. FREE AND INDEPENDENT.**
