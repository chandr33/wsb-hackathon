Currently GME is hovering around 250-280 which is one of the most bullish breakouts.

When GME hit 348 I actually sold all my positions. I had 20,000 Shares of GME. I got out with 300% profit. but I knew because of such sell orders it will dive greatly to around $250-200

but I am not like any other apes. I doubled my positions and invested 90% of my profit+ funds by doing consecutive limit order from $250-150 and fortunately, 75% of my orders has been filled.

Why GME is not responding to the market selloffs?

GME is one of those stocks where there's been a massive shortage of supply than demands. People who bought are not only holding but also buying more and more. as a result, it has proved to be immune to the famous market sell-offs and gay bear attacks. 

GME predictions:

GME may have a great future because of its unique physical game business and its cult culture, but we may see new highs for the next 2-3 weeks. 

GME may hit $500 at the end of March, and $800 at the end of the year. but it may never be seen below $300 for the next 6 months. And already there's been a massive options activity going on.

34,876 calls were in the money @ $260 Friday, 3/12/21

155,612 puts were out of the money @ $260 Friday, 3/12/21

ITM @ $260 call options went from 24,768 wednesday 3/9 to 34876 friday 3/12. (10,108 that were written between those dates)

there were 31,105 call options between 250 and 300 that were written Friday (only 330 closed ITM though) 

there were 13,579 call contracts written for 3/12 and 3/19 for $800 dollars since wednesday (baller)

between wednesday and thursday there were 3,100 less calls between $170 and $210 (that big dip perhaps??)

still new to options so I only put the Open Interest for these contracts and the strike prices
