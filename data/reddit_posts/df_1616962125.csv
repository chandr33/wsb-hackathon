87,mfacrl,"Someone that is more familiar with reading option order flow, maybe you can share some insight. **Why did Robinhood fuck me on this option sell?** 

Per customer support's response: ""Auto-execution / selling begins 60-90 minutes prior to market close on expiration days. You’re not able to opt out of this risk check process.""

**I get that Robinhood arbitrarily decides to sell your shit when they want even on a cash account.** As I watched the price of the contracts hit the 90-minutes to market close, I was fine taking the chance that my contracts sold at $405 each. Then the 60-minutes hit, and I was willing to accept that the least I'd take was $510 per contract (it was going up). The auto-execution didn't trigger, so I figured that Robinhood evaluated my account through their arbitrary, vague, non-transparent methods that I couldn't opt out of, and it was on me if I wanted to sell still before close or risk losing the premium.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option: $GME Call w/ 175 Strike &amp; Expiration 3/26**

`I hold 96 shares of GME, don't hate me for the options. 96 shares through FIDELITY.`

* Beginning 90 minutes prior to market close, the price was 4.05, or $405 per contract.
* For the next 30 minutes, the price ranged from 3.90 to 9.05, with an average of 5.74.
* Robinhood decided not to auto-execute a sell.
* With 60 minutes left before market close, the price was 5.10.
* Robinhood decided not to auto-execute a sell.
* Then we're at 58 minutes until market close, the price is 4.46, and 149 separate orders have been traded on this option between 2:30 PM - 4:02 PM ET.
* Another minute passes, the price of the options dips, and Robinhood decides to sell.
* **At what price? $2.52; $252 per contract.**
* The price immediately jumps back up, continuing to a high of 6.80.
* At market close, the most recent price was 4.95 with the 175-strike options being in-the-money at a stock price of 181.00.

Am I wrong here? Or is **Robinhood doing the same shit they were just charged by the SEC for**. The title of this post says ""Why did.."" - I guess I'm looking for the answer to ""Did they.."" fuck me. But I won't give them the benefit of the doubt. Fuck Robinhood.

“Robinhood failed to seek to obtain the best reasonably available terms when executing customers’ orders, causing customers to lose tens of millions of dollars,” said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit

Robinhood executed this order at a price that was inferior to what the customer would receive if Robinhood acted in the customer's best interest. Robinhood ignored their obligations to customers while selling order flow and executing customer trades at arbitrary, vaguely-defined terms that the customer can not opt out of, to the benefit of Susquehanna and Citadel Securities. ",Why Did Robinhood Fuck Me on this Option Sell?,0.67,1616966734,secureID2424
