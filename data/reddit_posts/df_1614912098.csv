89,ly2o5t,"I'm reposting my original post with some more context regarding $UWMC.

Listen guys, don't just buy stocks because it's on WSB, do your own DD (Due Diligence) beforehand. With that being said, if you do your DD on UWMC, you'll see this stock is unique with a great future ahead of itself.

Please refer below:

$UWMC - I truly like this stock.

Quick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall.

Short Interest - I see a lot of people talking about short interest and short float percentage and don't seem to quite understand it completely. If there's a short interest of %10 thats considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater thats considered extremely high. When GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. With that aside, here are some current updates on the short percentages of UWMC, GME, AMC, RKT.

UWMC - 28% as of 03/03/2021

GME - 26% as of 03/03/2021

AMC - 14% as of 03/03/2021

RKT - 17% as of 03/03/2021

UWMC is Americas leader in underwriting loans and mortgages. They have differentiated themselves from their competitors by having their business create the fastest and most effective consumer to lender process to be qualified/approved for their mortgage application and be provided the best competitive rates.  UWMC doesn't ""Lend"" any funds, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they provide institutions, lenders, and consumers is a simple process they can use to apply, compare, and complete a mortgage application. Their system and software is proprietary to UWMC and institutions such as small banks, credit unions, brokers, and lenders use it because it reduces time &amp; cost on a multitude of spectrums and the process is much quicker; meaning closing applications faster equates to higher revenue for institutions and Lenders. The whole process is completed through UWMC from consumer to lender, and provides enormous benefit to both B2C and B2B.

You look me in the eye right now and tell me you have a hard time seeing this? 👀👀👀

$UWMC 🚀🚀🚀

Mods please make this a serious thread. Thanks.

\*I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is some lightweight DD to be used to provide the community with some insight on UWMC\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*To all the negative comments, yes my username is ShortChecker, I thought it was unique and it also wasn't taken. Where did the idea come from? The enormous amount of ridiculously shorted stocks, literally was that basic. Second, to all GME 💎🖐, I wish you the best and I hope to see you on the moon! 🚀✊. As mentioned in the post, this is just my lightweight DD on a stock and is only here to provide insight and for you to do your own DD and make your own informed decision. I also can't reply to comments due to the new rules in WSB, hence, why I'm writing this in an edit on the post. I hope all traders and investors get that ticket to the moon, one way or another. 🚀🌔\*

\*For the person who posted proof of position or ban, well here it is. Was all I had left available in my account. Once my funds settle I'll be buying more, I'm not as lucky as some of you 😂\*

\*Another quick edit since I can't even comment on my own post. 😂.\*

I want to recognize u/DiZzyBonne who provided excellent DD in the comment section. It's always great to get other peoples perspectives and opinions especially when they work in that field. u/DiZzyBonne you're the true definition of ""Not all heroes wear capes!"" 🚀✊

\*GME short interest update: Currently up at 31% short interest free float.\*

If you're a GME 💎🖐 holder, HODL that god damn line! If I was invested in GME, I'd be jerking off to every 0.01% increase that occurs as well. 🚀🌔

I hope all you 🦍's profit at the highest level possible. I called my EX just to tell her that I never really loved her. Once I met UWMC, I then realized what true love really is. ✊🦍🚀🌔.

Personal Update: This is all that I currently have in my account today to trade with. It ain't much, but it's honest work. 😂 I could have bought at $7.88, but I chose to buy now. (Honestly, I'll be real, I just kept missing the dip 🦍😂). I really like this stock. 💎🖐.
