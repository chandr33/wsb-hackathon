53,m5gawh,"Hello fellow apes. I'm just wondering if someone can explain to me how a $2m, $1m, or even $100k floor is actually possible. I'm all in 7 shares at $380 each right now, FOMO'd in at nearly the worst possible time in January, and never averaged down cus I didn't have the cash for that. So I've been patiently holding, because people like a month ago were all feeling very confident we could moon in the $1k to $10k range, which is why I bought in to begin with, cus that sounded great, right? But now people are adding more 0s to the end of that number (100k, 1m, etc), and my smooth brain is just having trouble comprehending how we could all possibly actually cash out that kind of money... 

There's about 70m shares of GME. If we all sold for $1k, that would be a total value of $70b, right. That's a number I can wrap my head around HFs being forced to pay out so we can enjoy our tendies. Add another 0 at $10k, and that's $700b. Quite a difference obviously, but I can still wrap my brain around that kind of wealth. But if we keep adding 0s we're looking at $7t or $70t, and those numbers just *sound* too big to be possible, if that makes sense. I can't wrap my brain around how that money would actually be produced so we could all cash out like that. People keep making this analogy in here about buying or selling a used car, and how you don't have to care about where the money comes from, but that comparison just falls short to me because how are you comparing selling a used car for a few thousand to literally trillions of dollars... I'm not a shill, just looking for reassurance that I wouldn't turn into a bag holder if I kept holding at $10k a share, which would be absolutely life-changing money already... look at my post history if you need to, I'm just an OSRS junkie who happened to catch wind of GME lol",Help dumb ape understand,1.0,1615797875,NoCurrencies

91,m5gnrm,"Today’s Play

It is about 5AM at the moment. The futures are slightly up but about breakeven. With stimulus money hitting accounts. I expect the market to be green today. What this means is that it isn’t necessary to buy value, safe stocks or be defensive. We can buy high PE, growth or even companies that lose money. Remember though it is 5am at the moment a lot can change by 9:30am. So please don’t contact me at 10am and ask me what happened if you clearly see the market down. If at 9:15 futures are down, something happens….clearly we don’t want growth.

I repeat because of what happened on GOCO last week where some people bought afternoon, hours after a Morgan downgrade. **THINGS CHANGE THRU THE DAY! CHECK THE NEWS!! MORGAN CAME AROUND 9AM, MY POST WAS AROUND 7:30-8AM!!!**

GoodRX GDRX – This company has amazing potential as prices rise on medications. GoodRX is a medication discount/coupon company that gets a small kickback from each user. The amazing thing is that you can use GDRX for free without having health insurance. You do not need to pay anywhere near full price. Here is another kicker! GDRX can be used if you have insurance as well and sometimes offer even more of a discount. We are an aging nation and more of us are getting medications. Because this can be used with or without insurance the possibilities are endless. This was crushed many months ago when AMZN said they are going to do something similar, however the market is so big there can be many players. As said, this is not a value play. They have grown sales 73% this year and barely breakeven, but on a bull run, this is exactly what you want to own!
