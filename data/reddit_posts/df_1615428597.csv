🚀  Roblox is widely viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of COVID-19 as lock-down orders, school shut-downs, and parents dealing with their young children 7 days a week permeated the world. The data supports this as Daily Active Users (DAU) doubled on a YoY basis in a short timeframe. Roblox provides 3D virtual world experiences to over 36M DAUs.
During the pandemic, growth exploded and ~75% of children aged 9 to 12 use the platform. To continue its growth, Roblox is adding events to capture additional users and hours spent on the platform.


🚀


🚀🚀 One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.


🚀


🚀🚀🚀  Roblox isn't your traditional developer or publisher of video games nor is it a video gaming company as the business model combines gaming and social. Roblox fits the Andreessen Horowitz model as it can be free and it's widely available across gaming consoles, PCs, and even mobile (iOS and Android) and, more importantly, friends can play together across different platforms. From a business model sense, Roblox is a platform company that has a network effect, the more users who engage with the platform will, in turn, invite their friends. From a ""social"" point of view, Roblox users spend 2.5X more time on Roblox than YouTube. 


 🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀 On the other side of the platform are developers who create ""experiences"" (or games) for the players and, in 2019, developers created over 20M experiences. The key, however, is that Roblox provides the tools for developers to create a game and, more importantly, as players get older, some develop games on Roblox. Monetization occurs when some users buy Robux to pay developers for an experience or virtual items for their avatar. In essence, there are two self-reinforcing network effects occurring where more players will invite their friends who will become players and more players on Roblox will create more developers to create additional content..


🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 In some ways, the business model is similar to eBay's (EBAY) business model as eBay created a platform to connect sellers with buyers and sellers pay eBay to list their goods. The difference with Roblox is that not all players buy Robux and, rather than Roblox taking 100% of Robux's sales, Roblox takes a percentage of Robux sales as its fee. However, do not be fooled that Roblox may take only a ""small fee"" as it is estimated that the fees that Roblox charge its developers are in excess of 70% (Adopt Me!: The most popular game you've never played) and while Roblox may take at least 70%, for those who purchase Robux via the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, fees to those platforms, i.e. Google and Apple, are 30%.

That is why I have put a sell order in for 100k per share.

I know that I can only speak for myself, as an individual, and this is most definitely not financial advice for any sort of community.

I just know that having active sell orders in for 100k is the only way for me, an individual, to obtain 100k per share. For myself.

I certainly would not want to find myself holding liquid shares that my broker may be loaning out to hedge funds. This would be, in my mind, a very unwise decision. For myself.

2        The best deal is the one that brings the most tendies.

2        Tendies are everything.

3        Never spend more for an stonk than you have to. 

6        Never allow family to stand in the way of tendies.

7        Keep your ears open.

8        Small print leads to large risk.

9        Opportunity plus instinct equals tendies.

10        Greed is eternal.

13        Anything worth doing is worth doing for tendies.

18        An Ape without tendies is no Ape at all. 

21        Never place friendship above tendies.

22        A wise man can hear tendies in the wind.

23        Nothing is more important than your health... except for your money. 

31        Never make fun of an Ape's mother...insult something he cares about instead. 

40        She can touch your lobes, but never your tendies. 

41        Tendies is its own reward. 

44        Never confuse wisdom with luck. 

54        Rate divided by time equals tendies. (Also known as the ""Velocity of Stonks"") 

55        Take joy from tendies and tendies from joy. 

58        There is no substitute for success. 

59        Free advice is seldom cheap. 

62        The riskier the road, the greater the tendies. 

68        Risk doesn't always equal reward. 

74        Knowledge equals tendies. 

89        Ask not what your tendiess can do for you, but what you can do for your tendiess. 

97        Enough... is never enough. 

98        Every man has his price.

98        If you can't take it with you, don't go. 

99        Trust is the biggest liability of all. 

101        Tendies trumps emotion. 

102        Nature decays, but tendies lasts forever.

104        Faith moves stonks. 

106        There is no honor in poverty. 

108        Hope doesn't keep the lights on. 

109        Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack. 

123        Even a blind man can recognize the glow of tendies. 

135        Listen to secrets, but never repeat them. 

141        Only fools pay retail. 

144        There's nothing wrong with charity... as long as it winds up in your pocket. 

151        Even when you're a customer, sell yourself. 

162        Even in the worst of times, someone turns tendies.

181        Not even dishonesty can tarnish the shine of tendies. 

189        Let others keep their reputation. You keep their tendies. 

190        Hear all, trust nothing. 

193        Trouble comes in threes. 

202        The justification for tendies is tendies. 

208        Sometimes the only thing more dangerous than a question is an answer.

211        Retards are the rungs on the ladder of success. Don't hesitate to step on them. 

217        You can't free a fish from water.

218        Always know what you're buying. 

218        Sometimes what you get free costs entirely too much. 

229        Tendies lasts longer than lust.

235        Duck; death is tall. 

236        You can't buy fate. 

242        More is good... All is better. 

243        Always leave yourself an out. 

255        A wife is a luxury... a smart accountant a necessity. 

261        A wealthy man can afford anything except a conscience. 

263        Never allow doubt to tarnish your lust for tendies. 

267        If you believe it, they believe it. 

284        Deep down, everyone's a nApe. 

285        No good deed ever goes unpunished.

286        When DFV leaves, it's all over.

When the messenger comes to appropriate your tendiess... kill the messenger.

Time, like tendies, is a highly limited commodity.

Always inspect the merchandise before making a deal.

I don’t believe you’ll be able to bring down a hedge fund, but you have brought much needed attention to the terrible abuses that hedge funds have gotten away with for as long as they have existed. Here is my only concern about what is happening. New investors loading up on a very risky stock. Everyone isn’t going to be able to cash out at the moon. There will be bag holders who crash with the ship, because let’s face it, GME isn’t fundamentally worth 200$ or 300 or 500 or 1000$. It will eventually settle to a price where it belongs. I won’t debate on what that price, although I’d say in the 40s is fair, maybe even into the 60s with the new attention WSB provided and the management improvements they’ve made. That being said, my concern is for the newer investor. Losing 90% of your investment on their first trade, may leave a bad taste in their mouth. May discourage them from the market all together. So please, be practical. Understand that some will get lambos and some will get 1980s fieros when all is said and done. Just don’t put your outside the market life in jeopardy on a gamble.

Position- 10 shares @ average of $155

I haven't listened to kid rock in a few years. About a week ago I started listening to the classics off and on  Fwd to TODAY.

I just finished up a service call about an hour outside my city and I'm headed back. So I throw kid rock on shuffle and check Gme.... Gme go brrrr $340+... I decide to call my buddy who's an experienced technical trader who also has diamond hands. To ask about limit sells..... he say no.... ape understand now. Get off the phone..... FUCK!!!! $240. Kid rock comes back on (devil without a cause). I'm driving, the lunch lady is dumping spaghetti on to my paper plate, kid rock is yelling and the road I'm on is windy as hell trying to knock me off the road kinda wind. I usually ride with my phone on my center console on the stocks with spotify  playing  so I can see it and skip songs. When it resumed at 228 (i believe) and dropped to 198 and halted I picked up the phone. And I went to sell all I had to do was hit sell. I was there in the dark seeing nothing but red and the song changes... Kid rock lonely road of faith....FAITH... FAITH in the apes.... FAITH in daddy cohen... I put the phone down and a few minutes go by. I'm still freaking out but less. I pull over and get on WSB to see how the sentiment is looking, may have prayed to a deity or two. After looking at WSB my hands were so diamond I was scratching my phone. Check the stocks... halted at $264.  Wooooooo. May not seem like much but it was a roller coaster for me. 

Truly my intention in selling was to take some profit and double down in the dip (obviously an artificial dip) . Missed it the first time bought in all between 275 and 100. Saw 480 and rode it all the way down and back up. I could lose all the money I have in it and not miss a beat, still going to work tomorrow. So why not hold.

🚀  Roblox is widely viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of COVID-19 as lock-down orders, school shut-downs, and parents dealing with their young children 7 days a week permeated the world. The data supports this as Daily Active Users (DAU) doubled on a YoY basis in a short timeframe. Roblox provides 3D virtual world experiences to over 36M DAUs.
During the pandemic, growth exploded and ~75% of children aged 9 to 12 use the platform. To continue its growth, Roblox is adding events to capture additional users and hours spent on the platform.


🚀


🚀🚀 One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.


🚀


🚀🚀🚀  Roblox isn't your traditional developer or publisher of video games nor is it a video gaming company as the business model combines gaming and social. Roblox fits the Andreessen Horowitz model as it can be free and it's widely available across gaming consoles, PCs, and even mobile (iOS and Android) and, more importantly, friends can play together across different platforms. From a business model sense, Roblox is a platform company that has a network effect, the more users who engage with the platform will, in turn, invite their friends. From a ""social"" point of view, Roblox users spend 2.5X more time on Roblox than YouTube. 


 🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀 On the other side of the platform are developers who create ""experiences"" (or games) for the players and, in 2019, developers created over 20M experiences. The key, however, is that Roblox provides the tools for developers to create a game and, more importantly, as players get older, some develop games on Roblox. Monetization occurs when some users buy Robux to pay developers for an experience or virtual items for their avatar. In essence, there are two self-reinforcing network effects occurring where more players will invite their friends who will become players and more players on Roblox will create more developers to create additional content..


🚀


🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 In some ways, the business model is similar to eBay's (EBAY) business model as eBay created a platform to connect sellers with buyers and sellers pay eBay to list their goods. The difference with Roblox is that not all players buy Robux and, rather than Roblox taking 100% of Robux's sales, Roblox takes a percentage of Robux sales as its fee. However, do not be fooled that Roblox may take only a ""small fee"" as it is estimated that the fees that Roblox charge its developers are in excess of 70% (Adopt Me!: The most popular game you've never played) and while Roblox may take at least 70%, for those who purchase Robux via the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, fees to those platforms, i.e. Google and Apple, are 30%.

72,m2foo3,"Today we saw the price drop from a high of 348 to a low of 178, that is a 170 dollar drop in less than 15-20 minutes
Maybe I'm smooth brained, but I am pretty sure the hedgies don't have that kind of leverage

STOP LOSSES!
There are quite a few big problems with setting stop losses, if you have read any of the dd on the call contract ladders you probably know that as the price rises more and more contracts come In The Money and it drives the price higher as a result, in the process it puts new calls in the money, price goes up, etc etc

Stop losses are essential the same, but in the opposite direction, as large stop losses are triggered, the price drops and it triggers a new set, etc etc, dropping the price much lower than what the hedgies could have actually caused. 

Did you know
THEY CAN SEE ALL LIMIT ORDERS AND STOP LOSSES! 
In setting these we are literally showing them price targets and how many shares will sell at any given price, they can see the ladder of stop losses going down and all they have to do is set their own sells at the right prices along the way then drop the price low enough to trigger the first big set from there they can sit back and watch us screw ourselves over.

Dont give them the power, also do you really want to be the one selling at 200 then watching the price pop back to 260, if you trust the DD, and you believe in the squeeze then why would you risk it!?! Im pretty sure the reason we didn't pop back to 300 or 350 is because the drop created a bunch of sellers who can't afford to buy back the shares they lost, don't be one of them
