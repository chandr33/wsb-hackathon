[https://9to5google.com/2021/03/09/shadow-game-streaming-bankruptcy/](https://9to5google.com/2021/03/09/shadow-game-streaming-bankruptcy/)

With Shadow, you get a gaming PC in the cloud that can run AAA games and that you can access from almost any device. That means playing your favorite PC games on your iPhone or playing Half-Life: Alyx from your Quest 2.

Shadow feels like a service from the future, and successfully does what Stadia and others could not.

This would get investors thinking outside the brick-and-mortar opportunities for GameStop and expand GME's avenues for growth.","GameStop should buy Shadow, the recently bankrupt cloud gaming service. Shadow is an amazing Stadia-like service with a loyal user base.",1.0,1617205647,keithaxline
4,mh8zvy,"So I'm just an ape who joined with the gme hype, made and lost some money on other stocks discussed here but I do have a system for Apple I thought I'd share.

Apple has given me +50-80% returns 5 times in the last month. Simply, when the stock price falls below $120 I buy call options for ~$123-124, 2 weeks out. The price will normally stay for a day and then rise $1-2 pre-market and I take my profit and reinvest on the next dip.

I'm attempting the strategy with other stocks that appear as volatile as Apple but at various price points so that I can rotate my options between various stocks and keep my money from just sitting waiting for dips/rises to buy/sell.

25,mh96r3,"I'm not trying to give financial advice for dummies, but I know a lot of guys are new at this shit and I wanted to explain basic maths for less retarded apes and tell a story about an ape named Jack Mi. Offswald. 

Jack has $1k dollars burning a hole in his pocket from govt socalisms. Jack is a poor ape with big dreams of having his own Lambo and the govt gave him a payday.  Jack sees the flashy GME's going to the moon and wants to have diamond hands like all the other apes, but the maths are hard for retards.

Jack yolos his $1k on a stonk at $200. He gets 5 golden tickets to the moon and is ready for his rocketship..  The problem is Jack is retarded and failed maths in High School. Jack didn't realize to make $100 in tendies with only 5 stonks his $200 golden ticket needs to jump up $20.

Jack didn't get that lucky, the stonk barely moved it bounced from $190 to $205 and he's stuck like a dummy looking for his Lambo keys in the gutter at 2am on a rainy moonless night. 2 weeks go by and Jack gets a little lucky by selling his 5 stonks to get his $1k dollars back. He didn't lose anything, but he didn't gain anything either. Jack just let some fat pig borrow his money for 2 weeks free of charge.

Jack checks the memes and sees a less flashy stock but the memes are great so he yolos in. This time the stock is only $2 and Jack gets 500 golden tickets to the moon. 2 days later Jack's cash account has settled and the $2 stock has been up and down from $1.90 to $2.25. Jack sells at $2.20 and gets $100 in sweet tendies.

 Jack Mi. Offswald is now less of a retarded ape because he found out if you don't have a lot of green it's better to yolo on cheaper stocks that don't need big gains than get left bag holding in an expensive stonk that you will never get any gains from. Jack still doesn't have his Lambo but at least he now has the keys to a rusty 1981 Honda Accord and he's out driving on a full moon night with the windows down because his AC is broken, but at least he can now see the moon..","A poor Ape doesn't have to always be retarded, a story about Jack Mi.
