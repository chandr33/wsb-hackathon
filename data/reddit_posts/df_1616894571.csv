21,mes2pf,"I was Aping around on reddit Friday night.  I saw a comment from u/Birdztheman that they couldn’t get a shirt shipped from GameStop to Canada. I liked the shirt also, so I offered to buy two and ship one. Then we decided to buy more shirts. I’m not making this up. Next I tweeted about it and tagged Kelli Durkin ""@KelliLamberD"" just as a heads up. She DM’d me and said to send her our info and she would handle the direct ship.

I gave her the info and she was right on it. That’s just crazy to me. It shows the talk of Delight the Customer at the earning call wasn’t just talk. Screenshots are compiled in image. The two orders are from me being retarded and not setting the quantity for two of each shirt. At least I got to click the buy button more.

I like the shirts, I like the stock, GameStop.

**What:**

Form ADV? Among other things, contains the most up to date information on any registered investor of firm and can be 100+ pages long. One can normally obtain the form here (scroll to bottom search bar): [https://www.investor.gov/CRS](https://www.investor.gov/CRS) 

**When:**

However, as of this morning (mar 27, 2021) it’s been disabled. I have been using this site wo issue for a  l o n g  time so to see this gov.’t web search _suddenly stop working_ **raises no red flags**. I did post about the good intel that you can find on this form about hedge funds for the first time 6days ago and it was working fine then too. Week ago I said to myself, just download them all now bc they might block us from accessing them and quickly laughed because that would be paranoid, right? Now, nothing

49,mesq4n,"I've heard &amp; even relayed the argument that ""*it gives shorts data that can be used against us*"", but I don't think it's a coherent response, though I'd love to hear a good defense of why it is. 

Hedge funds are sophisticated entities that have access to the type of real-time/up-to-date  financial data &amp; trading tools that make manipulation of markets possible. How reasonable is it to believe they don't already know what retail's holdings are? I think it's very unreasonable. If it's true that they already know, &amp; given that we *don't*, the asymmetry therein  only disadvantages retail.

Many have also bought into the thesis that this war is being fought above our heads between large institutions, &amp; the prevailing sentiment is that our side has the overwhelming advantage. Alongside this is the belief that retail holdings are inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, i.e. our holdings are so small that even if we all sold, long hedge funds could still force the squeeze and/or increased retail buying over the short-term isn't enough to have a significant effect on the outcome. 

The way I see it, if you hold either or both of these positions, there's still no room for the belief that it would be detrimental for retail to estimate its holdings.

63,met1x7,"I spent the last two weeks getting my karma up to 50 so I could make this post. Sorry r/AskReddit. 

This is a 100% self serving post but I feel like I gotta share and who better to burden than the very people who changed my life. 

Here goes nothing.

Several years ago I found myself living the American Dream. I was an almost 40 father of 2, divorced and like many people my age, over educated yet severely underemployed. 

Going through the divorce brought something to light that was glaringly obvious. I literally owned NOTHING. I have been working for 3 quarters of my life and I had negative wealth. 

Car - owned by wellsfargo
Apartment - owned by faceless giant chinese conglomerate
College Education - owned by my student loan servicer (which became the federal goverment)
Zero savings and 20 gand in CC debt

Several disasters later, Hurricane Harvey then a fire, my disenfranchisement hit it's peak. Resolute to my seemingly preordained mediocrity I began focusing my energy on mearly serviving and making sure my daughters felt loved and safe. Depression and anxiety abound I slogged through the years stuck in a system that was engineered to keep me EXACTLY where I was. 

Enter the events of late 2020. I began flowing and got caught up in all the hype that was the fabled Game Stop short squeeze. Inspired by the superstars (DFV, Pappa Musk and the like) I YOLOed my entire cash reserve of 2000$ on GME at 122 as it was on the way back down to the 40s after the initial peak. I was fully prepared to loose it all. I was convinced this was my last opportunity to throw my meager support behind a cause I have never felt stronger about. I was and still am positive average hardworking people like myselves can show the big boys a little of how painful it has been our here 1 or 2 shares at a time. Show them that we see them privatizing all the profits and socializing all the losses. Ever since they recklessly gambled with our futures and TANKED global markets you would think there would be consequences. You would think there would be new rules or new oversight. If anything they learned that they could get away with it and doubled down on the tactics that proved to be so lucrative. 

I've watched you beautiful apes meme and dick joke your way into something bigger than all of us. No matter what our leaders tell us we are still strong. We still have power to effect change. We don't have to sit by and watch as the big boys do what they will with our tendies. We don't have to be afraid. 

Watching what was done with profits has truly been inspiring. As billionaires look out for themselves and consolidate their wealth you look out for eachother and spread what you can. 

I have zero sense of what's to come but my uno deck and magic 8 ball say it is going to be interesting. 

I now have 40 shares and I am NEVER selling. What this represents is more important to me than profits. And to top it off I can now say I OWN a piece of a company i believe in and I like the stock. 

TLDR: Thank you Reddit. Thank you r/wallstreetbets. Thank you Apes. Thank you you smooth brained SOBs. I joined the cause on the way down of the first spike. I've bought, I've sold, I've lost and I've gained but most of all I have learned. I've learned that I am not alone, things haven't gone too far yet and there is still time (hope).
