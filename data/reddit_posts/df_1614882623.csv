**$RKT NOT SQUOZE YET AT ALL***

There's just some facts I want to point out and please correct me if I'm wrong: don’t downvote if ur just a hater, downvote if my research doesn’t add up

Since the beginning of space exploration, the concept of going to the moon (or beyond) has never been done without a rocket. I don't need to put the ticker ($RKT) because there's some weird (non-existent) war being waged between game stoppers and rocket launchers.  FOR NO REASON!


1) $RKT got crushed yesterday, meaning there is an SSR in effect (I went to the Nasdaq site and didn't see it so please clarify). If there isn't - who cares.

1a) see 5)

2)  The fact of the matter is that [30 million shares were sold short yesterday](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210303.txt). Meaning it was shorted all the way down. By who? By us? By hedges? Who cares. 

2a) as of right now (5pm March 4th ) [RKT has second highest short %](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=131&amp;amp;f=cap_smallover,geo_usa,sh_avgvol_o500,sh_curvol_o500,sh_opt_optionshort,sh_price_o3,sh_relvol_o1,sh_short_high&amp;amp;o=-shortinterestshare) 


3) The market today is a disaster in its entirety due to the US Treasury and shaky paper hands everywhere. They say it's meme stocks but only difference these losers just print money, and make the rules. **We are the real traders**

4) There was a big 2.2 million buy right at open that sent the stock flying, my trading sen-sei verified this, according to lvl 2 data and I'm thinking this was institutional - it wasn't RIGHT at open. You can literally see it at Mkt open. 

5) The spaceship hasn't really gone down significantly. It didn't crash and burn like SpaceX's. This is on a very bad day in the market overall and lots of tension. It went down to 25-ish briefly and shot back up. Our rocket has not crashed and burned and held up quite well after a 70+% increase. If there was no SSR today, then wtf it’s definitely bottomed. 

6 (and the most important - toronto man): The dividend pays out $1.11 per share to every holder of the stock on March 9th. If a 2.2 million share buy sent the share put the price up, imagine when retail (and more institutions) buy in ahead of March 9th. Share buyback too? CEO said they are not selling those class D Shares A reminder of my second point) 30 million short volume. With impending volume...

Start your engines.

PS: HARD pin bar at 8 day moving avg. 

Also, short days to cover decreases with volume. 


I've been rocking with GME since the boom in Feb, here are one of my acccounts. but I know you have all been booming.


This is not advice, I just love the stock

Position: 35 @ 32

Update: [11 million more shorted today](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210304.txt)

36,lxrro1,"Whats up retards. Today I am going to offer you something much greater than chasing potential short squeezes. Instead I offer the 4th industrial revolution. That is Additive Manufacturing 2.0, and Desktop Metal(DM) is spearheading the campaign. 

The additive manufacturing industry is projected to increase from 12 billion to 150 billion over the next decade. 🤑
DM specializes in 3d printing metal devices. The purpose of this is to reduce the cost of products by not having to worry about shipping costs, and reducing carbon footprints. This is going to replace many of these large scale factories and turn them into many smaller scale facilities. EVERYWHERE is going to have these in the future. 

They have also acquired EnvisionTEC who specializes in 3d printing things for medical use. Mostly dental use. They also have over 140 patents for 3d printing which is potentially even more valuable. 

The legendary investor Bill Miller who beat the S&amp;P for 15 consecutive years and was early on Amazon and a Coin that has Bit in it(cant have that word in a post apprently). He believes in value investing, and this has gotten him to invest in these big winners who can literally change how the world operates. He currently has DM in his top 10 stocks, and has a large stake in it himself. 

The best part of this whole process is that they have just consolidated all of their public warrants. This has diluted the stock and caused the price to drop from its high 34 a month ago to 16 dollars. We are getting half off on a stock who has the potential to cause the 4th industrial revolution. 

So buckle up idiots. We have a rocket to catch. 🚀🚀🚀🚀",Additive Manufacturing projected to 10x in the next decade,0.73,1614883054,SouthernChicken77
