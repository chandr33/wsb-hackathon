7,m3720p,"Many who have a position in DAR know that they have made their money on animal waste reprocessing (into food and feed ingredients), but the untapped side of their business is starting to take light in the form of Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture between Darling and Valero, making a renewable diesel fuel made from recycled food and animal products. This may have been a new frontier years ago, but is part of the new wave of clean energy nowadays.

I‚Äôm not just a blind prospector, either. I work for Valero‚Äôs St. Charles refinery in LA. DGD has completely taken over all spending and priority of our plant as we‚Äôre having to try to keep up with the output and profit of the DGD, but are having a hard time doing so. And the one thing thing that keeps DGD making money is Darling‚Äôs feed stock of animal shit to refine into diesel that sells for $9+/gal. Of which they currently produce 450m gallons/year (these numbers coming from before their 2nd and 3rd expansion of the biodiesel plant). 

On the other hand, I am a little drunk and have a smooth ass brain. But if I‚Äôve piqued your interest, do a little DD of your own and the results may intrigue you. Especially with the country set to open up at any time and fuel (especially clean fuel, hell look at AMTX, pissed I sold at $9) going to be in higher demand.

Trend and trading range part1


-Traders try to profit from changes in prices: Buy low and sell high, or sell short at a high price and cover low. 

-A quick look at a chart reveals that markets spend most of their time in trading ranges, not in trends

-In an uptrend, each rally reaches higher resistance than the previous rally and each decline stops at higher support level than the previous bottom

-In a downtrend, each decline falls to a lower low than the previous low and each rally stops at a lower high than the preceding rally

-In a trading range, most rallies stop at about the same high and declines peter out at about the same low

- It is easier to bank during trends. It is harder to bank when prices are flat unless you write options, which requires a special skill.

-Trading in trends and in trading ranges calls for different tactics.

-When you go long(buy;calls) in an uptrend or sell short(puts;shorting) in a downtrend, you have to give that trend the benefit of the doubt and not be a paper handed bitch

-When you trade in a trading range, however, you have to be nimble andclose out your position at the slightest sign of a reversal.

-Another difference in trading tactics between trends and trading ranges is the handling of strength and weakness

-Follow strength during trends- 
buy in uptrends and sell short in downtrends

-When prices are in a trading range: 
Sometimes you have to do the opposite - buy weakness and sell strength.

-Uptrends emerge when bulls become excited and suddenly start buying thus forcing prices up. Bears see this and come in and start shorting thus pushing prices down; bulls then return in force, break the decline, and force prices to a new high

-Downtrends emerge when bears become excited and start selling, thus pushing the markets down. Bulls see this; come in with a flurry of buying and lifts prices; bears then return in force, sell short even more into that rally, stop it, and send prices to new lows.

-When bulls and bears are equally strong or weak, prices stay in a trading range. Prices in trading ranges go nowhere

-When bulls manage to push prices up, bears sell short into that rally and prices fall. 

-Bargain hunters step in and break the decline; bears cover shorts, their covering fuels a minor rally, and the cycle repeats.

-Identifying trends and trading ranges is one of the hardest tasks. It is easy to find them in the middle of a chart, but the closer you get to the right edge, the harder it gets.

-The past is fixed and easy to analyze. The future is fluid and uncertain. By the time you identify a trend, a good chunk of it is gone

-Nobody rings a bell when a trend dissolves into a trading range. By the time you realize this, you can lose some money trying to trade as if the market was still trending

-when trading, You have to base your decisions on probabilities in an atmosphere of uncertainty.

-Most people hate being wrong. They have to be right. They hang onto losing positions, waiting for the markets to turn.

-Trying to be right in the market is very expensive. Professional traders get out of losing trades fast. 

-When the market deviates from your analysis, cut losses without fuss or emotions.

-There is no single magic method for identifying trends and trading ranges. There‚Äôs several, and it pays to combine them.

-When the magical methods confirm one another, their message is reinforced. When they contradict one another, it is better to pass up a trade.

Heres some techniques to see if you should buy or sell

1-Analyze the monthly and then weekly chart and focus on the highs and lows of each week or day. When rallies keep reaching higher levels and declines keep stopping at higher levels, they identify an uptrend. 

-This signals buy as long as the uptrend continues. Every day update your stop loss to the middle between yesterday‚Äôs high and todays support or to todays support. An uptrend should not go below todays support 

-The pattern of lower lows and lower highs identifies a downtrend, and the pattern of irregular highs and lows points to a trading range

2-Pay attention to the slope of the trend and if its been going on for more than 1 day. 

-The more vertical the trend, the longer itll last. But as soon as you see it turning steep, it means that a reversal is closer and closer.

3-look for highest high or the lowest low for the last 30 days. If its been 30 days or more and there hasnt been a new high or a new low, then its in a trading range

4-use macd-histogram and the directional system. The directional system is a completely different animal. 

-When you identify an uptrend and decide to buy, you have to decide whether to buy immediately or wait for a dip. 

-If you buy fast, you get in gear with the trend, but your stops are likely to be in the negative and you risk more. 

-Thats why I always suggest to buy eod unless you really know the stock, like insider trading, hedge funds and how much they paid, public offering, sec filings, etc

-If you wait for a dip,You will risk less but will have four groups of competitors: 

:Owners of the stock who want to add to their positions, shorts who want to get out even, traders who never bought, and traders who sold too early but are eager to get back in.

-The waiting area for a dip/pullback is very crowded

-Markets are not known for their charity, and a deep dip/pullback may well signal the beginning of a reversal. This also applies to a downtrend

-If the market is in a trading range and youre waiting for a breakout, decide whether to buy in anticipation of a breakout, during a breakout, or on a pullback after a valid breakout. 

-I yolo when i see a trend forming and am sure of support with a very tight stop and a lot of research 

-But If you wanna be smart, you can buy:
a third in anticipation, a third on a breakout, and a third on a pullback.

-Always use stop limits. By the time you type in the sell order, it could be down $100

-It pays to put on a smaller position in a trend but use a wider stop; you wont be shaken out

-You may put on a bigger position in a trading range but use a tighter stop.

-Finding good entry points is extremely important in trading ranges. Be very precise because the profit potential is so limited. 

-A trend is more forgiving of a sloppy entry, as long as you trade in the direction of the trend. 

-When you cannot tell whether the market is in a trend or in a trading range, remember that professionals give the benefit of the doubt to trading ranges. If you are not sure, stand aside and get sure

-Professionals love trading ranges because they can slide in and out of positions with little risk of being impaled by a trend

The Music for tonight's post is **Satori Part III** by **Flower Traveling Band**

**I am not a professional.  I am not a financial advisor.** Do not listen to anything I say. I've lost a lot of fucking money in the stock market. This is not a recommendation to make any sort of investment or decision or to do anything but obviously waste your time. On that note, anyone want to develop an Ap that plays the HFT algorithm activity set to tones so you can listen to your GME all day and not have to stare.   In fact it would be great if you could assign different instruments to your all of your stocks.  My ASRT 3/19 calls would be a sad trombone(I actually feel bad for the CEO after that brutal Earnings Call..), my GOEV YOLO Horde is an electric guitar and my 7.00 3/12 CLVS calls would just be a hobo coughing up blood. I'm kind of serious about this.

**I have a lot more calls of the same ones I previously had, you could say I doubled down.**

Today were just going to have a chat.  About doubling down.  This is a wall of text about some basic ideas and the thesis to why we are here.  **If you don't need or want that jump to the bottom and do some sick gainz post in the comments.**

# The story thus far.

I think its high time we get back to basics and understand exactly what it is we are doing here.  This is going to be a reading post.  Put your glasses on. I guess I want to take you through my thinking so if its wrong you can correct me or if its right you can pull your knuckles just a bit farther off the ground than they were yesterday.

I really have to thank my brother for reminding me to pick up some $GOEV last Friday when hanging out on skid row looking for some juice on discount. Without him I wouldn't be here... /u/pennyether, /u/manpozi, /u/Dramatic-Trainer268,/u/PlaneReflection and The Godfather.   I honestly think the Godfather.. I think he's a Rogue GME HFT algorithm that became self aware and gives us advice when he's not ""knife fighting at the speed of light"". Mostly because ""he's in on the joke"" that his vast and unimaginable intellect is being used to high frequency trade... Gamestop....

**But this really did start last Friday** when I noticed $GOEV all strung out in its gimp cage and decided to take a look at some fundamentals and ask ""who put you in the gimp cage?"" and ""Why is this palace of shame so far away from its 20 day MVA of shame?.""  It was close of business day and I picked up some 15$ 4/16 calls for free (In fact someone paid me to take them off their hands) I did some research over the weekend. What I found was 2 things... 1. The SI (Short Interest or the amount of shares sold short of the stock) wasn't that crazy but it was there.  2. The Utilization (The amount of shares available for shorting  was 97%.  This means 97% of the easily accessible short shares were used.

I decided to write a post about it and got a little carried away. But there are elements of the first post that are true.

1. 9 million shares sold short. Shorts were in at a reachable SP from here by April.
2. Most of them were utilized (So no more easily available ammo)
3. Impending catalyst could revalue company.
4. SP well below 20day MVA
5. 15$ Calls will make money by April.

My thesis is thus - **GOEV is undervalued, Short Interest is In too Deep and can't go any deeper. A near term catalyst might revalue the company(presentation at company). I will profit off of this by purchasing calls.**

# Your Thesis should never be - Brother Luminous Says Rocket EMOJI go boom boom on GOEV$!$

That's cool and all man but that's also like asking Helen Keller if the coast is clear.

**Coin Flip odds at best.**

The next day we found out that someone had erected a sick gamma ladder.  We looked at some data and decided to publish the ladder but we found out we were wrong because we were off on the float due to Yahoo not reporting it right.  Ultimately as a person who puts this stuff on the internet its my responsibility to be as accurate as possible but this is a fundamental basic part of critical thinking.  If its too good to be true than it probably isn't.  Or ""Extraordinary claims requires extra ordinary evidence.""

Life Lesson: If you run into the pool boy on your way out the door to work, make sure he has a license.  **Better yet, make sure you have a pool.**

So we made a mistake it was pointed out and we corrected it and we went on with our lives.  This is an important feedback loop.  The mistake was that the gamma ramp wasn't ridiculous it was just great.  Nothing fundamentally changed about my thesis.  In fact the Gamma Ramp just confirmed my thesis.  We corrected the data, I made an effort to tell people who had commented on the post that the data was wrong. I am sure someone somewhere made a decision based upon bullshit that they read on the internet and it won't be the first bad decision that they made.  Check people's work.  If they get upset when you ask them about numbers don't listen to them.

Ortex updates a day after the trading day so its always backwards facing.  The trading last Monday ran around the mountain but was encouraging.  The trading on Tuesday when we found the Gamma Ramp correlated into a Long Player gap opening the SP to take advantage of the Delta Hedge.

What we found was that SP increased and SI increased which meant that shorts were Capping the price. There always seemed to be a ridiculous 200 share bundle that came out of nowhere. This is essentially what shorts do on the SSR list.  (GOEV has a reserved seat at that table.  Its across from CLVS. I knew I recognized you from somewhere. )  This is around the time the prominence of the presentation unfolded that something big was coming. We also found out from Ortex that the SP increased which was confirmatory of the price capping by the shorts.  The two days of gap openings began to be signal from noise.  So now in the Thesis.

**GOEV is undervalued. Short Interest is in too Deep and Can't go any deeper. SP still below 20MVA . Catalyst might be a big deal and has a higher probability of revaluing the company,  Some Long erected a gamma ramp behind the Shorts back and is actively shoving them into the wood chipper. The squeeze will expend 10 million shares of SI into a ticker that gets 4 million in total volume per day. GOEV longs are Masochists and will never sell.  I will profit.**

So I bought some more calls in more risky places. Yesterday the Truck Leaks dropped it was the same deal Shorts expended SI at lower prices than they were originally short in and were still being dragged to the wood chipper which now is something like 17 and some change.  The Truck looked fucking awesome.

The video dropped, the Chairman of the Board knocked it out of the park and I went all in.

(His Gigantic set of brass pantknuckles will be the subject of another post)

Because I will say it one more time. Have a thesis.

**GOEV is undervalued. Short Interest is in too Deep and Can't go any deeper. SP still below 20MVA . Catalyst might be a big deal and has a higher probability of revaluing the company,  Some Long erected a gamma ramp behind the Shorts back and is actively shoving them into the wood chipper. The wood chipper will expend 10 million shares of SI into a ticker that gets 4 million in total volume.  I will profit.**

**This is the peak of reason from which I yolo.**

TLDR - **Brother Luminous Says Rocket EMOJI go boom boom on GOEV$!$ is not a good reason to invest.**

# So Here we are:

* Should I still get in?
   * That's up to you and your thesis.  One of the things that will break the thesis is that the shorts meaningfully covered.  (Probably not likely DTC is 1.5 and retail is actually not giving shorts the chance to cover... Mostly because GOEV longs from 30$ are masochists and enjoy the pain).  Ortex Stats will tell.
   * Our friend the Long isn't around and doesn't gap the open.  (Again not likely, whoever had the money to start this game will finish it millions are riding on this)
   * The catalyst isn't enough to revalue. (Up to you 6 articles came out that said Canoo Truck vs Cyber Truck and CanooTruck wins) Even being compared is the big deal.
   * Is there still short interest to feed to the wood chipper
   * Tomorrow morning there will probably be 1 less than they had... so take that for any sort of indication
* How do I get out?
   * I dunno, I held sava 10 dollar  calls past 100 being like... Its only up from here.
   * Read about cost averaging.
* Whats the price Target?
   * I dunno, it depends if this shit goes critical think RKT, you'll know when the forced covering is over and new short positions are being taken... Diamonds turn to Ice real quick.  The earlier you are in on something the later you can stay and still feel good... Take that for what its worth...

Could I lose everything tommorow?  Yep.

# Todays Price Action -

For full effect put on Bulls on Parade by RATM

Shit straight bulled out the gate like Frankenstein got into the Viagra patch and ran into a wave of short interest that barely contain it. This was assisted by the magnetism of the Options Ladder to Heaven as market makers delta attempted to delta hedge 700k shares.   The minute candles look psycho as  348k shares traded hands. Literally as if Voltron and Godzilla hit each other 348k times in a minute.  Like when your parents let you pick the movie to watch for your 30th birthday and you still pick Dragon Ball Z.  ^(There's a reason why your dad cries.) Yet again we saw the Gap opening Signature and the price rising steadily through the day.  Lets just be honest Bulls made Bears their bitch over and over and over and over again. There were mini cups and handles but the price was obviously more tight than the past few days spurred by the catalyst of last nights Video Drop and article.   The late in the day drop proved to be a bear trap and a clear illustration of the cup and handle morphology where bulls push a price, act like they disappear slowly and then increase the pressure.  Shorts now in underwater have less ammo to fight with, try to attack back and lose (forming the handle) and bulls on parade.  AH was hilarious as we saw the share price just go out of control.  I think the volume indicates this is a margin call.  Maybe the closed door presentation went well.. But no one buys 5k blocks AH without extremely good reason.   I will post the Ortex Stats and Options Charm before Market open tomorrow.

Lemme start of that I‚Äôm very much a smooth brained ape who eats crayons and throws his own shit. I‚Äôm not saying this is the FACT seeing as no one but him knows, but I like to think this is somewhat accurate. Also not financial advice at all. 

Being a marketing major, I tend to read trends and hidden messages in all types of media and attribute them to what‚Äôs going on, and there‚Äôs something that keeps repeating in a lot of his tweets. Trying to be as unbiased as I can this is what I see. 

https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1367858650551902209?s=21 

Let‚Äôs start with this one is , I feel like this clear cut that the price is wrong, and knowing his standpoint , it‚Äôs undervalued. This was 6days ago. 

https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1369307339568873473?s=21

This is from forest gump, put into context this is about halfway/ towards the end of when he stops running. What do I take from this? Forest Gump is running around the country, this took a a year and some. DFV first started this last year. To me it signifies how LONG the journey has been. It‚Äôs not a race, it‚Äôs a MARATHON. You also see the media interview Forest when he first started getting attention. After a while the media got bored with him similar to how DFV got all the media attention about a month or two ago, and now media has fallen silent on the issues (unless of course it‚Äôs negative).  What is a common factor in both ? Forrest Gump wasn‚Äôt done with his goal once the media fell off, he kept running. DFV still has his goal seeing as he continues to tweet, he‚Äôs still running. 

Edit: shoutout to homie(don‚Äôt know how to tag him but look at comments) for letting me know the after scene. DFV has always been for the people, this is known. In the scenes following Forrest gains a following of people. The first scene is someone saying Forrest gave him HOPE, Forrest acknowledges it. After, Forrest also helps a couple people, SPECIFICALLY SAYING ‚ÄúI found a year later those people made lots of money‚Äù. Sound familiar?
 
Now this is when I start seeing a VERY similar trend. 


https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1368952570874654730?s=21 (3/8/21) 

Without trying to detect deeper meaning, what is the clear point of this? This fundamentally shows a character (Mario) going through obstacles (the mission) to reach his goal. At the end the character has one more obstacle (the boss) to get his goal. The funny thing about this is look where he chooses to end it at. Underneath he pins the original tweet which clearly shows Mario recovering something from peach to help him beat his enemy‚Äôs. Why would this not be included? It would help morale right? 

My belief is that we‚Äôre currently on this mission, which is why he chose to leave out the reward. But more importantly, the mission Mario is on signifies that it takes TIME before reaching your goal. This is even more clear the next tweet. 

https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1369667682480558080?s=21

Do we really have have to look at this one ? Once again, tying in with all the tweets, longevity and TIME is a common theme. However, this time he left in that very special ending , the one where he finally defeats the boss. What do I take from this ? First and once again , it‚Äôs gonna take TIME, be patient, but that we‚Äôre finally getting closer to end game. 


https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1370030183504244739?s=21

This shows me what the other tweet showed me. The spaceship is finally getting ready to load up,the ball is officially rolling. Now this is more an inference but why couldn‚Äôt he use another tweet, like a ball going down hill ? Because with this we see that it‚Äôs gonna take some more TIME before both sides collide BUT they do collide. In the original episode you hear them collide. The ball has begun to roll. 


https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1370092246918438917?s=21 

This is one that I see two messages. From a biased view, clearly ‚Äúletting the cat out the bag‚Äù, that‚Äôs not hard. But once again with the reoccurring theme, the cat doesn‚Äôt jump out immediately does it? No , it takes its TIME to rise up and look around. This combined with the music which has historically been used when one is about to catch their prey makes me believe it‚Äôs almost time. 

Now with today‚Äôs action I‚Äôve seen everyone speculate , complain, wonder why today was slow. Shouldnt today started it? What‚Äôs going on ?

RELAX, the cat attacked when the TIME was right, we saw it hop out the box right? It will catch it‚Äôs prey. Not early, not late, but right when it‚Äôs time. All the messages I see is that it does take TIME but each one has the character reach its goal. Don‚Äôt stress, the end is coming soon, when is soon? Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe next month, who knows. But if you‚Äôve trusted DFV this far, keep that trust.

The Music for tonight's post is **Satori Part III** by **Flower Traveling Band**

**I am not a professional.  I am not a financial advisor.** Do not listen to anything I say. I've lost a lot of fucking money in the stock market. This is not a recommendation to make any sort of investment or decision or to do anything but obviously waste your time.

**I have a lot more calls of the same ones I previously had, you could say I doubled down.**

Today were just going to have a chat.  About doubling down.  This is a wall of text about some basic ideas and the thesis to why we are here.  **If you don't need or want that jump to the bottom and do some sick gainz post in the comments.**

# The story thus far.

I think its high time we get back to basics and understand exactly what it is we are doing here.  This is going to be a reading post.  Put your glasses on. I guess I want to take you through my thinking so if its wrong you can correct me or if its right you can pull your knuckles just a bit farther off the ground than they were yesterday.

I really have to thank my brother for reminding me to pick up some $GOEV last Friday when hanging out on skid row looking for some juice on discount. Without him I wouldn't be here... /u/pennyether, /u/manpozi, /u/Dramatic-Trainer268,/u/PlaneReflection and The Godfather.   I honestly think the Godfather.. I think he's a Rogue GME HFT algorithm that became self aware and gives us advice when he's not ""knife fighting at the speed of light"". Mostly because ""he's in on the joke"" that his vast and unimaginable intellect is being used to high frequency trade... Gamestop....

**But this really did start last Friday** when I noticed $GOEV all strung out in its gimp cage and decided to take a look at some fundamentals and ask ""who put you in the gimp cage?"" and ""Why is this palace of shame so far away from its 20 day MVA of shame?.""  It was close of business day and I picked up some 15$ 4/16 calls for free (In fact someone paid me to take them off their hands) I did some research over the weekend. What I found was 2 things... 1. The SI (Short Interest or the amount of shares sold short of the stock) wasn't that crazy but it was there.  2. The Utilization (The amount of shares available for shorting  was 97%.  This means 97% of the easily accessible short shares were used.

I decided to write a post about it and got a little carried away. But there are elements of the first post that are true.

1. 9 million shares sold short. Shorts were in at a reachable SP from here by April.
2. Most of them were utilized (So no more easily available ammo)
3. Impending catalyst could revalue company.
4. SP well below 20day MVA
5. 15$ Calls will make money by April.

My thesis is thus - **GOEV is undervalued, Short Interest is In too Deep and can't go any deeper. A near term catalyst might revalue the company(presentation at company). I will profit off of this by purchasing calls.**

# Your Thesis should never be - Brother Luminous Says Rocket EMOJI go boom boom on GOEV$!$

That's cool and all man but that's also like asking Helen Keller if the coast is clear.

**Coin Flip odds at best.**

The next day we found out that someone had erected a sick gamma ladder.  We looked at some data and decided to publish the ladder but we found out we were wrong because we were off on the float due to Yahoo not reporting it right.  Ultimately as a person who puts this stuff on the internet its my responsibility to be as accurate as possible but this is a fundamental basic part of critical thinking.  If its too good to be true than it probably isn't.  Or ""Extraordinary claims requires extra ordinary evidence.""

Life Lesson: If you run into the pool boy on your way out the door to work, make sure he has a license.  **Better yet, make sure you have a pool.**

So we made a mistake it was pointed out and we corrected it and we went on with our lives.  This is an important feedback loop.  The mistake was that the gamma ramp wasn't ridiculous it was just great.  Nothing fundamentally changed about my thesis.  In fact the Gamma Ramp just confirmed my thesis.  We corrected the data, I made an effort to tell people who had commented on the post that the data was wrong. I am sure someone somewhere made a decision based upon bullshit that they read on the internet and it won't be the first bad decision that they made.  Check people's work.  If they get upset when you ask them about numbers don't listen to them.

Ortex updates a day after the trading day so its always backwards facing.  The trading last Monday ran around the mountain but was encouraging.  The trading on Tuesday when we found the Gamma Ramp correlated into a Long Player gap opening the SP to take advantage of the Delta Hedge.

What we found was that SP increased and SI increased which meant that shorts were Capping the price. There always seemed to be a ridiculous 200 share bundle that came out of nowhere. This is essentially what shorts do on the SSR list.  (GOEV has a reserved seat at that table.  Its across from CLVS. I knew I recognized you from somewhere. )  This is around the time the prominence of the presentation unfolded that something big was coming. We also found out from Ortex that the SP increased which was confirmatory of the price capping by the shorts.  The two days of gap openings began to be signal from noise.  So now in the Thesis.

**GOEV is undervalued. Short Interest is in too Deep and Can't go any deeper. SP still below 20MVA . Catalyst might be a big deal and has a higher probability of revaluing the company,  Some Long erected a gamma ramp behind the Shorts back and is actively shoving them into the wood chipper. The squeeze will expend 10 million shares of SI into a ticker that gets 4 million in total volume per day. GOEV longs are Masochists and will never sell.  I will profit.**

So I bought some more calls in more risky places. Yesterday the Truck Leaks dropped it was the same deal Shorts expended SI at lower prices than they were originally short in and were still being dragged to the wood chipper which now is something like 17 and some change.  The Truck looked fucking awesome.

The video dropped, the Chairman of the Board knocked it out of the park and I went all in.

(His Gigantic set of brass pantknuckles will be the subject of another post)

Because I will say it one more time. Have a thesis.

**GOEV is undervalued. Short Interest is in too Deep and Can't go any deeper. SP still below 20MVA . Catalyst might be a big deal and has a higher probability of revaluing the company,  Some Long erected a gamma ramp behind the Shorts back and is actively shoving them into the wood chipper. The wood chipper will expend 10 million shares of SI into a ticker that gets 4 million in total volume.  I will profit.**

**This is the peak of reason from which I yolo.**

TLDR - **Brother Luminous Says Rocket EMOJI go boom boom on GOEV$!$ is not a good reason to invest.**

# So Here we are:

* Should I still get in?
   * That's up to you and your thesis.  One of the things that will break the thesis is that the shorts meaningfully covered.  (Probably not likely DTC is 1.5 and retail is actually not giving shorts the chance to cover... Mostly because GOEV longs from 30$ are masochists and enjoy the pain).  Ortex Stats will tell.
   * Our friend the Long isn't around and doesn't gap the open.  (Again not likely, whoever had the money to start this game will finish it millions are riding on this)
   * The catalyst isn't enough to revalue. (Up to you 6 articles came out that said Canoo Truck vs Cyber Truck and CanooTruck wins) Even being compared is the big deal.
   * Is there still short interest to feed to the wood chipper
   * Tomorrow morning there will probably be 1 less than they had... so take that for any sort of indication
* How do I get out?
   * I dunno, I held sava 10 dollar  calls past 100 being like... Its only up from here.
   * Read about cost averaging.
* Whats the price Target?
   * I dunno, it depends if this shit goes critical think RKT, you'll know when the forced covering is over and new short positions are being taken... Diamonds turn to Ice real quick.  The earlier you are in on something the later you can stay and still feel good... Take that for what its worth...

Could I lose everything tommorow?  Yep.

# 3/11/2021 Todays Price Action -

For full effect put on Bulls on Parade by RATM

Shit straight bulled out the gate like Frankenstein got into the Viagra patch and ran into a wave of short interest that barely contain it. This was assisted by the magnetism of the Options Ladder to Heaven as market makers delta attempted to delta hedge 700k shares.   The minute candles look psycho as  348k shares traded hands. Literally as if Voltron and Godzilla hit each other 348k times in a minute.  Like when your parents let you pick the movie to watch for your 30th birthday and you still pick Dragon Ball Z.  ^(There's a reason why your dad cries.) Yet again we saw the Gap opening Signature and the price rising steadily through the day.  Lets just be honest Bulls made Bears their bitch over and over and over and over again. There were mini cups and handles but the price was obviously more tight than the past few days spurred by the catalyst of last nights Video Drop and article.   The late in the day drop proved to be a bear trap and a clear illustration of the cup and handle morphology where bulls push a price, act like they disappear slowly and then increase the pressure.  Shorts now in underwater have less ammo to fight with, try to attack back and lose (forming the handle) and bulls on parade.  AH was hilarious as we saw the share price just go out of control.  I think the volume indicates this is a margin call.  Maybe the closed door presentation went well.. But no one buys 5k blocks AH without extremely good reason.   I will post the Ortex Stats and Options Charm before Market open tomorrow.

Tomorrow... Tomorrow will be sick.. if we open at 16.00 the 17.50 calls will wake up and dance...

Melvins wife is now your wife‚Äôs girlfriend.

You may be asking yourself, how did I get here, how did apes come to rule the world? Well it all begin when the hedge funds attacked. They were out for blood, ape blood specifically. They did everything they could to make ape paper hand and go home to watch wife‚Äôs boyfriend plow her. Ape no go home, ape hear no bell. 

March 12th 2021 was the moment everything changed, with the stimmy check approved it was the beginning of this story. 1400 bananas would be directly deposited in each ü¶ß‚Äôs ass over that weekend. 1400 banana at the time equaled about 5 $GME for reference. Each ape screeched and smeared shit all over the hedge funds walls as they traded banana for $GME. 

Then it happened.... the squueze, you‚Äôve never seen such a magnificent squeeze, not even that time your uncle harry squeezed your nuts at your birthday party when you were 7. This squeeze was different. Apes held strong as $GME flew past 800 bananas on 3/15, many of apes calls became ITM and apes knew collectively, EXERCISE. This is when ape donger grew 6 inches and began to throb. 3/16 was when if ape no hold $GME ape only see red in portfolio as hedge funds dumped all boomer stock and began to panic to close their shorts, but it was too late. $GME mooned past 10k in less than an hour after opening. 

This is when the paper hand nation attacked and sold their 1.8 collective fractional shares sending the stock down for a brief moment to $5k. But apes stronger together, so apes bought the dip. Within a matter of 20 minutes apes knew the battle had been won $GME was well over $50k and kept climbing, apes began shaving off a share here and there to secure profit as $GME bonerd up to $1M/share where it sat for 6 whole days while diamond hands collected their wealth the hedge funds knew they were done for. 

Unfortunately after this squeeze those who didn‚Äôt sell at the peak saw a sharp drop in price, all the way down to $420,069. The ‚Äúbag holders‚Äù were tired, scared and shaken. Luckily apes know buy the dip, stonks only go up. At this point the mainstream investor learned that $GME fundamentals far outweighed any other stock and the $GME standard was developed. Those of you who held through that wild ride woke up and checked your portfolio with .78 $GME to see a total valuation of $6,942,069.69. Life‚Äôs good, go eat a banana you ape.

Some N00b Short put up a ""Scary"" 340k block at like 13.40 on Ask and I am sure the Chairman himself took it off his hands. Throughout the day, there were mini cups and handles but the price was obviously more tight than the past few days spurred by the catalyst of last nights Video Drop and article.   The late in the day drop proved to be a bear trap and a clear illustration of the cup and handle morphology where bulls push a price, act like they disappear slowly and then increase the pressure.  Shorts now in underwater have less ammo to fight with, try to attack back and lose (forming the handle) and bulls on parade.  AH was hilarious as we saw the share price just go out of control.  I think the volume indicates this is a margin call.  Maybe the closed door presentation went well.. But no one buys 5k blocks AH without extremely good reason.

68,m37h6l,"Full Diligence Post on Nokia (NOK) Ahead of Capital Markets Day next Thursday (3/18)

 I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several different subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and wanted to share my findings.

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with¬†shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and¬†engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp:
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.",Full Diligence Post on Nokia (NOK) Ahead of Capital Markets Day next Thursday (3/18) credit- u/moneygrabber007,1.0,1615516352,BigPoppyAidan

Greetings fellow autists,

Firstly, I‚Äôd like to say how proud I am to be a part of this community.  I‚Äôve been a redditor for almost a decade and this is by far the best group of apes I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of calling my brother and sisters.  I truly care about each and every one of you.  I‚Äôve put a ridiculous amount of time in trying to determine how to personally navigate this journey and I‚Äôd like to share my findings with you.  Briefly about me:  I have an educational and corporate background in applied mathematics and engineering.  I am not a financial markets expert; however, I have a good amount of faith in my ability to analyze, understand, and manage risk.  Hopefully some of you find this to be helpful.

There are a two points that I‚Äôd like to address:

1. How I got comfortable with my plays.
2. The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis.

How I got comfortable with my plays:

Firstly, let‚Äôs make this clear: I am not wearing my investor‚Äôs hat right now.  I‚Äôm not diversifying or hedging in any way.  This is a calculated bet for me.  I think the risk is worth the potential rewards.  This is the opportunity of a lifetime; however, nothing is guaranteed and even if the MOASS were guaranteed, none of us know exactly when it will happen.  If I put money in that I could not afford to lose, I damn near guarantee that I would paper hands.  This would not only hurt my fellow apes, but it would also hurt me.  It‚Äôs a lot easier to diamond hands, or even just profit, when you‚Äôre truly fully prepared to lose everything that you put on the table.  It‚Äôs cliche, but scared money doesn‚Äôt make money...

I figured out an amount of money that could result in life changing gains, but that I‚Äôll be okay with losing if things don‚Äôt pan out as I expect them.  Next step, how do I allocate that money?  Stocks vs call options.  My greedy side wanted to yolo the vast majority of my bet into deep out of the money call options.  My conservative side told me that I don‚Äôt really know when this rocket takes off, so I should be a bit careful.  The beauty in the stock is that I can sell it whenever I want.  The beauty in the options is their leverage.  I don‚Äôt want to get into the nuances of purchasing/evaluating options as that can be a series of posts on its own, but this is a fairly high level look at what I did.  I ended up putting approximately 50% of my bet into stocks.  I didn‚Äôt do this all at once, but spread my stock purchases out over a few week period.  I purchased a few options already near the money with expiration dates a month or so out (plot spoiler, they‚Äôre very much in the money now).  This gave me some time to see how things would develop and the ability to exercise them instead of just closing for a profit.  I also acquired options fairly far out of the money, with later expiration dates.  These comprise a small percentage of my investment \~ 10% or so, but also allow me to greatly capitalize if the rocket goes boom within my timeframe.  Finally I left a bit of money to continue with option (or stock) plays if this journey goes on for longer than initially expected.  Obviously we don‚Äôt all have the purchasing power to execute this sort of strategy, but hopefully some of it still applies to everyone.

The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis:

I‚Äôm not talking about engineered FUD.  I usually just laugh at that shit and move on.  That doesn‚Äôt phase me at all, if anything it strengthens my resolve.  What does bother me are posts that are positive and ostensibly sound, but fundamentally lacking in trustworth data and analysis.  I‚Äôve seen a ton of posts with data/conclusions that are flat out incorrect, i.e. misconstruing short volume and short interest, not realizing that the data isn‚Äôt up to date, using data without understand the mechanisms behind it, etc.   As an example, when discussing the amount of shares left to short from iborrowdesk, no one seems to talk about what that actually means.  When/how are those shares replenished (meaning if there are only 150,000 shares left today, what does that actually mean for tomorrow or the next day)?  How long do the borrowers have to use said shares?  You get the point.  Additionally, there are posts using financial indicators or other metrics/features, comparing time series of graphs, etc.  Many of them draw conclusions that are just not correct.  There are so many different indicators/features and they do tell part of the story, but far from everything and especially not when used in isolation.  Accurately modeling financial data is difficult.  That doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt think people should do it.  We should definitely do it, but we need to not only understand how to use these tools but also what they can tell us, if anything, and how to effectively communicate our findings to an audience with very different levels of experience.  It‚Äôs like this:  You work in construction.  You go onto a forum and see people talking about building houses.  Someone is like look: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a screwdriver, hammer, etc‚Äù this house will be easy to build.  You‚Äôd think that sounded ridiculous, right?  That‚Äôs how a lot of these posts sound.  Being excited is awesome, and believe me I‚Äôm fucking excited, but these posts are misleading a lot of people.  For people with little to no knowledge, they may be misled into making poor decisions.  For people in the know, they‚Äôre probably thinking: ‚Äúwtf are these retards talking about?‚Äù  Both can ultimately lead people to lose their faith, and that is a very bad outcome.

tl;dr Have a fucking plan.  Think with your greedy and conservative hats.  Be extremely careful in giving credence to posts that say: ‚ÄúX will happen on Y date.‚Äù  DD posters: please, please, please do your fucking due diligence.  Question everything that you write.  Imagine that you are pitching a strategy to a bunch of really smart and nit-picky people that will question everything you say.  Break down everything.  Explore the nuances and tradeoffs at each point of your hypothesis, analysis, and conclusions.  With that being said,  I want to end this on a positive note.  I‚Äôm super fucking bullish on GME.  I believe that we will moon, but I don‚Äôt know when and neither does anyone else on here.",GME: Preparations for extraplanetary travel!,1.0,1615516891,the_fucking_doctor
92,m37nb4,"Yes I know it might be a little late but I only just found out and I know hundreds of thousands of other people haven‚Äôt either but yes. It has been confirmed that the rebalance will indeed take place on the 19th like he predicted (please do find his account and read his DD). Right now as it stands, XRT is the biggest ETF that has the largest holding of GameStop at 10% holding in their basket. It is one of Citadel and friends main ‚Äòdark pool‚Äô in which they are heavily shorting so that way, they are indirectly shorting GME which therefore won‚Äôt be part of the current shorting % meaning that the short interest is much higher than 30% (people are expecting it to be around +300%). It has been quoted ‚Äúthe next rebalancing is scheduled for March 19, after which GameStop should be adjusted back to a 1-2% weighting in the fund. Similarly, GAMR is scheduled to be rebalanced in March as well, after which its three-bucket equal-weighting scheme should bring GameStop‚Äôs exposure in the fund down to less than 2%.‚Äù 

~ https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/gamestop-throws-2-etfs-loop?nopaging=1


THIS IS HUGE. XRT will sell 70-80% of their GME weighting from 10% basket weight to 2% basket weight. That means that all of the shares that the hedgefunds have shorted will be forced to be closed so citadel and friends WILL have to buy back every single share they shorted through XRT, which will be huge for the gamma squeeze. 

This leads 2 GREAT results for the diamond apes:

A) There will be a gamma squeeze occurring on the 19th or precisely when XRT exercizes their power to sell GME back to 2% weight

B) There are even more other reasons like the Stimulus check coming out where it‚Äôs predicted that 50% of households are going to invest into the markets which will be very bullish for the entire market, GameStop hearing on the 17th and many other reasons thus: if the squeeze kicks off before the 19th, then it means the squeeze will continue squeeze at least until the 19th where this all kicks off
