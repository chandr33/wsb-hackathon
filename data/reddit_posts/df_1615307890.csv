You see, as attention spans grow shorter and shorter, PR consists more and more of just distracting people for a tiny amount of time. If you can ride out a PR crisis for a few days, you're in the clear. There's always some other bullshit to pay attention to. So they bet their app and their reputations on this: if they could distract WSB for a few days, everyone would forget about GME. Sure some devoted apes would be on here throwing their turds around, but the power of the masses would be dissipated, never to return.

Ironically, it's you retards who proved conventional wisdom wrong. They threw everything they had at you, and you stayed focused and strong. They tried precious metals, an artificial dip, and constant negative media attention, but you all kept your eyes on the golden banana.

The reason for this is the FDA has found postmarket and labeling deficiencies in their application for  pimavanserin .  The company has until 4/3 to correct the issue.  

That said, I believe the overcorrection today was massive.  Even without this new drug on the market, the company still has Nuplazid  in it's portfolio and 2019 revenue of $339 million.  Their average share price over the past 5 years is  $32.63 .  

I see a lot of opportunity to make money with calls beyond April, where the position of the company will be more clear.  If the deficiency is corrected prior to 4/3, the stock is instantly above $40 again.  Even if not, The current market price has overcorrected.  A safe bet would be to balance long calls with April puts.

I've made this because apes don't have easy access to options data. While some broker platforms have pretty cutting edge tools for retail level investment, they're not clear or easy to use. So I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents some good information in a clear and easy to understand way.

&amp;#x200B;

[Number of open option contracts for GME. Darker lines indicate more open contracts. Data scraped 3x daily.](https://preview.redd.it/i8a3d88nx0m61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=404ee42aa7ff8144e148da08e619e4321025b1fd)

# Ok, so what am looking at?

This is a plot of all open option contracts on GME. For those not familiar, in the simplest possible terms, an option is a contract to either buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a price that you chose (the **strike**), and at a date that you also choose (the **expiry**). An option that will allow you to *buy* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *call*. An option that allows you to *sell* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *put.*

Since an option is a contract, two parties are required: 1.) The option seller/writer, and 2.) the option buyer. For every contract, there has to be a buyer and seller. So when you buy a contract, you are literally buying the *option* to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock.

On the other side of the contract, someone had to sell it to you. They are therefore taking your money in exchange for *maybe* having to provide you with 100 shares of stock if the price of the stock moved in your favor. 

The black lines/boxes in the plot represent the number of contracts 'open'. This means two parties have agreed to buy/sell an option contract between them at a given strike price and expiry date. If the contract is open, that means the buyer is still waiting on the stock price to move in their favor. If it doesn't move there before the expiry date, then the contract is worthless and the seller of the contract made money on the buyer. The dotted black line represents the price at time of writing. 

# So what does the data show then?

It shows a ton of contracts open at really extreme strike values. Right now there is a huge demand for GME contracts, so the price of *any* contract at *any* price is high. It appears that people are buying/selling a ton of put contracts at very low strikes. 

This means two things:

1. The people buying these contracts believe GME will crash down to these low values. They could also be people with lots of stock buying them to offset the risk if it crashes before they expect.
2. The people selling these contracts believe that even if the price of GME drops, it will never hit these low prices. Because all options are expensive right now, the sellers of these options stand to make a good profit if GME stays above $20. 

[Huge number of open put contracts below $20, expiring in mid April.](https://preview.redd.it/uy9h07dp41m61.png?width=1992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989a1b58ecf02ca8da5bead1d4ccb85d970328a9)

There are also some call options being bought sold at very high strikes, but nowhere near the volume of puts. The risk associated with selling calls is probably too great. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Tons of open contracts at $800 and $500](https://preview.redd.it/ytgw4m2k51m61.png?width=5859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a32ab80650692991e74b820dfd467dfa3da0beb8)

# Get to the point monkey

It is my opinion that people or hedge funds are selling huge amounts of way ""out-of-the-money"" (low strike value) puts to try and make profit off of apes who think GME will crash in a month. It is also possible someone knows something I don't. Regardless, this information teaches us something interesting.

84,m1ajwm,"$CLNE is a way to make money AND save the planet. Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) has emerged as an important way for truck fleet operators to reduce their carbon intensity and $CLNE is the leader in this space. 

Think of them as the central conduit for the decarbonization of trucking fleets. Operators come to them when they need financing to transition their fleets from diesel. Through close coordination with Westport Cummins ($WPRT), $CLNE gets fleet operators the loans needed to make a green transition economical. 

Next $CLNE offers these trucking operators guaranteed RNG supply via long term off-take agreements. CLNE operates 530 fueling stations to support RNG consumption across the US. California may have been the starting point but Today CLNE operates in over 30 states plus canada. Nobody comes close to having the geographical footprint of $CLNE. 

The last piece of the puzzle is RNG production. Once upon a time $CLNE was dependent on various producers to supply the RNG sold in their fueling stations. Fast forward to today, RNG has collaborations in place with both BP Total and Chevron to build their own RNG production capabilities. 

$CLNE reports tonight. Here is what to look out for:

1) AMZN in feb confirmed their first purchase of 1000 nat gas engines from $WPRT. These engines can run on RNG if desired. $CLNE has not confirmed any RNG fleet agreement with $AMZN but it has talked about a big mystery customer with whom they see large runway. So putting two and two together... Whoever the customer ends up being the bottom line is that fleet customers are adopting nat gas because they are all under pressure to show their ESG credentials and this is an obvious way to do something now. 

2) $CLNE inked formal partnerships in late 2020 with BP and Total to build their own RNG production centers. That is old news now but what should become clearer in next 1 or 2 quarters is just how these partnerships will accelerate their own RNG production capabilities. Total has committed to sharing up to $400mm in equity investments in new RNG production sites. That is an unlevered number; assuming 50/50 LTV on projects we might see almost $800mm of investments. You do not commit to that kind of capex unless you have the fleet customers lined up. 

3) The decision for $CLNE and it big partners to build their own RNG supply chains means $CLNE is not going to be dependent on any external party for the RNG they sell to fleet customers - they will have their own proprietary supply. By 2025 the company wants 100 pct of the fuel they sell to be internally sourced RNG. Expect this to drive big margin improvements due to the superior economics of selling your own RNG. 

4) Unlike many other hot ESG plays this company is on the cusp of being profitable. Company has been unprofitable but 2021 / 2022 is the year that $CLNE shows it can sustainably make money. 

5) RNG is a legitimately green fuel whose adoption has an important role to play as we decarbonize our economy. If you care about the environment you should be celebrating what this company is doing.",CLNE: Make money AND save the planet,1.0,1615308501,Disasterdujour888
