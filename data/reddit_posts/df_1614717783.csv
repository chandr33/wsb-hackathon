36,lwc3sr,"Apes, I'm sure that many of you are in a similar situation as me: Smooth brain, ADHD medicine, and wife's boyfriend force me to constantly refresh the DD page when I could be masturbating to cuck porn. Well, here is the remedy: a compilation of my favorite DD for GME, which is by no means complete, so please comment more links. Enjoy. 

**First post:** Here’s a link to the first DD that I did on GME, I still stand by everything I said in that. This covers previous price action, volume, brokerages, etc: 

**ETFs:** Hedge funds are massively shorting ETFs that contain GME or have a bearish sentiment in order to hide their positions, drive down the price, delay the squeeze, and make interest in GME decrease. Here are the links: 

**Borrow Rate:** Use this link from iborrowdesk to see that the available short shares of GME are behaving similarly to last time and that the borrow rate is hiking. Similar data can be found on fintel, but this site gives you more data:

**Short interest:** As I said, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an accurate short interest number because the numbers are probably not being accurately reported, naked shorts, and ETFs leading to indirect shorting. Here are a bunch of posts on all that shit: 

**Price action:** GME fractal pattern is repeating itself, which suggests that HFs keep trying to make it go down but it is resisting at every turn and is continuing to be bullish 

**Volume:** Couldn’t find the link to this but I saw a post comparing the short float and volume of the first squeeze to now and it’s very similar. If anyone has the link please comment because it’s almost identical. My original post and many other posts linked here also have information on volume similarities.

**Uncle Bruce:** Boomer who makes YouTube videos but is actually a smooth brain warrior with excellent insights about how some HFs are probably playing this long, which will only increase the price: 

**VIX:** GME price spikes seem to be correlated with more volatility in the market as the VIX usually spikes and SPX drops precipitously (note that if you think buying calls on the VIX is a good idea because of this, I would think twice because this squeeze will likely take longer and theta decay will eat your ass on VIX calls in the process): 

u/HeyItsPixeL**:** If you click on any of these links, click on this one. This is by far the best DD that I’ve ever seen on WSB. In short, he talks about the likelihood of a gamma/short squeeze all pointing to a specific date (March 19) because of naked shorts and provides a MASSIVE amount of data for it: 

**Catalysts and personal notes:** I echo everything that u/heyitspixel said in the above link. I also want to emphasize other potential catalysts such as earnings on March 26, possible acquisitions, AMC earnings tonight, Ryan Cohen tweets, DFV’s 500 april ITM calls, and Elon/Chamath/other celebrities tweeting about more interest in the stock. I cannot stress enough that I think this squeeze will take longer than the last one but will be bigger especially if us smooth brains continue to hold and buy. Right now, it seems that the HFs are building an extremely steep house of cards because of naked shorts that will eventually come tumbling down in an even bigger way than last time. They are trying to delay the squeeze so that people get bored and sell but all that it’s doing is building up the gas for the inevitable squeeze. I want to emphasize further than brokerages WILL be the end of this like they were last time, but I believe that because they have more liquidity and don’t want another media nightmare like last time, that they will let this last much longer. I also want to emphasize that their actions only have power if people actually do sell when they restrict buying. Finally, I want to emphasize heyitspixels sentiment that many other institutions seem to be long on this and want to profit from the squeeze as well, which only helps us. Right now, it seems like it’s WSB + some institution(s) v. HFs (Melvin, citadel, etc). Great posts about catalysts and future action: 

**Finally, I want to address 2 common arguments that I keep seeing:**

1. “the squeeze is already squoze, this information is public, it’s not gonna happen again” – to that I say, take a look at any post before the January squeeze and you will see the exact same shit. Based on the information I’ve provided above, it’s hard to deny that another squeeze is not imminent, but if you wanna miss out, your brain is smoother than mine.
2. “No way hedge funds will let this happen again, they learned from last time” – to which I say, 2007 has entered the chat. If you really think that these guys learn from massive mistakes, your brain is smoother than silk. Most of these fuckers who are short are shorting out of rage and spite, which is making them act illogical. The fact that there is still AT LEAST 60% short interest on this after that massive squeeze shows that most of them didn’t cover and want to dig this thing into the ground. Don’t be naïve.

**Conclusion:** (This is from my first post). Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be and the date of March 19. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.

""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon. HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK.

For those of you interested, my wife’s boyfriend has promised to let me go to the park with him WITHOUT MY LEASH ON if the stock goes above 1k. He already said that I can sleep in the garage instead of under the deck if it hits 800, so he has even more riding on this than the hedge funds.
