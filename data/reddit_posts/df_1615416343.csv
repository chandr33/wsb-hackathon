Okay smooth brains. I'm reading alot about how the dip today was a short attack and how the article talking about the dip to 180 came out before the dip. I have a different theory.

The institutional whales were testing us today! Here is what happened in my opinion. They did a massive sell off when prices reached around 350. Why? A couple reasons. The first reason is that this dip causes GME to be on the short sale restricted list tomorrow (greater than 10% dip). Hedges wouldn't intentionally want to put GME on the SSR list. The second reason is to test retail resolve. Will this dip lead to a massive sell off or will retail quickly seize the opportunity to buy on the dip? Well we saw what happened there. only 💎✋s left in the game now. The paper handed individuals with stop losses have been culled. If the price had continued to drop from 180 we would know that it was from retail mass paperhanding out of fear. Now if you have been checking the option chain for GME you will notice that right after this dip a huge amount of 800$ calls were made. Almost 45K OPTIONS now at $800 that expire THIS FRIDAY. The dip to 180 caused these $800 calls to be much further OTM than they would have been at 350, and therefore much cheaper to purchase. take a look at the option chain yourself.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/

The stage has been set for the short squeeze! The high level of 800$ calls basically means that institutional whales are betting that the hedges will be margin called at $800 share price.

Remember my fellow apes. SELL AFTER THE PEAK. If you sell before the peak you won't know just high it will go. If we all have this strategy that is the most dangerous scenario for the hedges! (This is a casino and this is gambling so don't gamble what you can't afford to close and have an exit strategy in mind)

tldr - institutional whales caused the dip to load up on calls, put GME on the short sale restricted list and remove all the paperhands. GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",GME dip theory,1.0,1615416430,oringedoorhinge

Of course GME is one of the biggest or most noticeable ones but look at others - the dip is the same. Was there some news or was it a big, massive, ""UGE"" sell off by a single entity? Or.... my conspiracy theory brain is firing away but my logical self has to think this is normal and there is an explination.

Something happened at 12:17 and lasted until 12:40. You can see it in a lot of stocks. It's so precise. Exactly 12:17 and each bottoms the V at 12:40. Even the ones that are ""off"" are off by a like minute.

GME exactly 12:17 crash. Over at 12:40

AMC - exactly the same time

KOSS same time

RIOT very similar with a small spike 1/2 way down

PLTR - same dip

TSLA - exact same dip

RKT crashes at the same time but doesn't follow the same dip pattern after falling

SPY a similar downtrend during the timeframe but times not exact

QQQ a drop starts at 12:17 but recovers at 12:38 not 12:40

Russell dip starts a minute earlier and ends a minute earlier

That said: Can we win when the firms executing the orders are willing to break the rules to earn a profit?

I've believed for a while now that retail is **not** the driving factor behind $GME, but riding the wave of a Wall Street war. It's even more apparent to me after 6 halts in half an hour. Saying today's volatility was due to market manipulation would be speculation (with strong evidence). But from evidence showcased at congressional hearings and previous SEC actions, it's also clear to me that Wall Street considers breaking the rules the cost of doing business. If $GME is costing firms hundreds of millions a day, part of me doesnt think hedge funds will let retail come out top.

You might be familiar with the idea of RGB colors. The most popular way that RGB colors are represented in computer programs is by using hexadecimal integers of the form #RRGGBB, where RR is the red component, GG is the green component, and BB is the blue component. Each of these components can range from 00 (no red/green/blue) to FF (as much red/green/blue as possible).

Obviously, GME is going straight green. Without loss of generality, then, we can represent GME's future price as the color of pure green: #00FF00

But wait, how does this convert to a price? Easy: we can just convert the hexadecimal integer to decimal.

If you've got the money, then 🚀🚀🚀 -- go for it. If you don't, then here is your chance to walk away with a good story to tell (*and you get to keep your house!*)",Remember: Only bet with what you an afford to lose...,1.0,1615417284,ar111
