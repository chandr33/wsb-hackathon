Big trading day ahead, will the Fed pause the music in this game of musical chairs... Will the Fed stop the music? Buy the rumor sale the news. We pushed thru and made another all-time high at 397.83 in the spy and promptly sold off thereafter. Can we push higher, is 400 in the cards today? No matter what happens, I will not execute any trades until after the fed speak. Also, be very careful of the head fake on the initial announcement. There is an obvious undertone in the broader market this Fed day; to Test and put pressure on the Fed by pushing rates higher and bond yields lower to see if the Fed will take action.  The 3 outcomes to prepare for are:1) Can we hold the 390-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. 2) We Break support at 390 area, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. 3) Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. 

1) Can we hold the 393-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. **50% probability** 

2) We Break support at 393 area, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. **40% probability** 

3) Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. **10% probability** 

Must keep and I on rates (tnx) could over heat market by rising sharply!

What does GME mean!? 
I've searched scientific texts from all the great researchers and even taken a course on finance but it was all useless. 

I still couldn't work it out. 

That was until now, while I'm sat at my desk eating my moderately sad cheese sandwich. I'm a little bit of a retard so I wrote down GME wrong in one of my equations, instead writing EMG. 

Thats when it hit me. 

GME = EMG.

**G**ood **M**orning **E**veryone 🦍🌚

Yesterday was an great day. Probably most of you are asking now wtf is he talking about? GME lost more than 20 Points. Well technicaly yes, but as No: It was an unnatural drop from 232$ to 172$ which depleted the resources of the HFers, we should see some upward movement with a bit of turbulence the next days.

**HODL THE LINE I ❤️ YOU APES**
Once we have hitted our diamond support at 172$, most of you Apes BUY THE FKN DIP and I love you therefore!

**How come we still see those unnatural drops**
Well as you now the HedgeFukers are dirty tricking basterds. They are buying every day tons of Long Positions and placing massive sell orders once their long positions hit an target. It seems they have built up an massive sell wall of those long positions at 220$ and 250$. 

**Pre-Market Update 1** 
Germany is quiet, not too much movement, too quiet. As we know from history every moment before the great battle, has quiet surroundings as fuk. GME started at 215$ and lost 13$ in the Pre-Market, the price is hovering an bit over the significant 200$ line. Shorts borrowing fee is at an record low with 0.7%, this suggests that the Shitters have reserved the right for very much shorting positions, which we apparently cannot see.

Shorts available: we can only see 400.000 
Current Pre-Market Price: 205$

**Pre-Market Update 2** (Fun update)
The Day is starting good. Wheather ain’t too bad, wifes boyfriend said he will give me his stim check to buy some more GME and as i bought the dip i noticed something: GME is 6.5% up from today’s pre-market low and resides currently at 213$ which is great news, thank you germans! Now guys tell me did you get your stimulus check, what are you going to do it? Mine is flowing directly into the stock I like, GME. How out you 🦍 🚀

**Yesterday**
Yesterday I’ve done an Apedate on AMC and promised an giveaway if AMC reaches 16$ EOD, which apparently did not happen. Today i would like to make another giveaway, I really want the stocks to go up and gift one Hoodie or T-Shirt to the Community.

**Todays enhanced Giveaway** to the community
Therefore I promise you fellow Apes 🦍, if GME reaches 260$ EOD I’ll donate any of **[THIS HOODIES](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie)** or even **[THIS T-SHIRTS](https://apemerch.com/product/gamestonk-t-shirt)** to the top comment (write Tshirt/Hoodie, your Size + desired Color). In case you can’t wait, this is my coupon code, which I have gotten when ordering there **diamondhands**, use it now!

Dont forget to choose between TShirt/Hoodie and write your Size and desired Color in the comments!

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

## Can-Fite BioPharma (CANF):

Can-Fite BioPharma is an Israeli biopharmaceutical company with fully integrated drug discovery and clinical development capabilities. The company has advanced patented compound pipelines in the phase II and phase III clinical development phases, which can solve autoimmune inflammation and cancer diseases .

Sunfit Biopharmaceuticals’ platform technology uses Gi protein-related A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) as a therapeutic target. A3AR is highly expressed in inflammation and cancer cells, among which low expression is found in normal cells, indicating that this receptor may be a unique target for pharmacological intervention. The company compound binds to A3AR with nM affinity and initiates the deregulation of NF-κB and Wnt signal transduction pathways, thereby producing anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects.

Can-Fite BioPharma’s drug product line is a synthetic, highly specific agonist and allosteric modulator for A3AR. All drugs have oral bioavailability and excellent safety.

**Canfit Biopharmaceuticals’ product candidates include:**

**1. CF101 (Piclidenoson)** , the main drug candidate of Can-Fite, is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Can-Fite holds 82% of OphthaliX Inc. (OTCBB: OPLI), which develops CF101 for ophthalmic indications, including dry eye syndrome, glaucoma and uveitis.

Can-Fite has licensed CF101 to Cipher Pharmaceuticals in Canada, Gebro Pharma GmbH in Spain, Switzerland and Austria, and RA to Kwang Dong in South Korea to treat autoimmune diseases.

**2. CF102 (Namodenoson)** , Can-Fite’s second drug candidate, is being developed for the treatment of liver cancer (primary liver cancer) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the phase II clinical trial phase; also for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma And hepatitis C virus disease.

Can-Fite has authorized Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceut in South Korea to use CF102 to treat liver cancer.

**3. CF602** , Can-Fite’s second-generation allosteric drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, has proven this concept in in vitro and in vivo studies; it is currently in preclinical trials for the treatment of sexual dysfunction

Can-Fite has extensive clinical experience, including more than 1,200 patients participating in the company’s clinical trials.

Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. and Icahn Medical College reached a cooperative research agreement on the treatment of liver disease.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Can-Fite Biopharma** (NYSEAMERICAN:[**CANF**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/canf-stock-quote/)) stock is on the rise Tuesday after announcing a $42.7 million deal with Ewopharma. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

The first drug in the deal is Piclidenoson, which is used to treat psoriasis. It gives Ewopharma the exclusive market and distribution rights for the drug in Central Eastern European countries.

The deal also covers Namodenoson. This is a treatment for liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The rights in this deal cover marketing and distribution in Central Eastern European countries and Switzerland.

The deal doesn’t stop there, either. It also allows for Ewopharma to extend its rights for these two drugs. That can happen if Can-Fite Biopharma discovers new uses for the treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This sent the stock price to 4.30 yesterday creating a bull trap that dropped it to 2.77 pre-market. A lot of shorters are still in it trying to make it go down below 2.00. They will keeping shorting today creating an opportunity for them to get squeezed out.

92,m709l5,"Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

### Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

### Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

&amp;#x200B;

[5 Year Net Income for Teradyne, rising from -$43m in 2016 to $784m in 2020. Return on Equity was 42.49&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/h23vdc1aaln61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be5437b649cbc2b03a13cadadd0ca0eee90ef6b)

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

### Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

### Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

### Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","Teradyne Inc DD, a stock with increasing online chatter",1.0,1615987299,akokaz1

94,m709w0,"# Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February - [source](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-apha-options-data-report-2021-03/)

A lot of analysts are raising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"".

Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.

The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.

Two important dates:

April 14, voting on the merger takes place

On or about April 20, the merger is completed

I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 – $18, I personally would still buy in.

I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.

# Possible plays:

1. Buy in low and sell before the merger if you're satisfied with the gains.
2. Buy in low or high as long as APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY share. For this option it doesn't matter how the price is as long as APHA is still the cheaper of the two AND it's 83.81% of a TLRY share. 

Why 83.81%

Every APHA share held through the merger will be turned into .8381 of a TLRY share. So for example:

100 APHA

20 TLRY

20 + (100 x .8381) TLRY = 103 TLRY

83 TLRY merged from 100 APHA would cost (@ current price \~$19.3): $1,601.9

83 TLRY bough directly as TLRY would cost (@ current price \~$25.5) : $2,116.5

So you save $514.6 by buying APHA instead. 

That math is true no matter how high the price of either gets. If TLRY becomes more expensive and APHA stays around the same, even better. If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind. 

# TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting. April 20, merger). Buy low, sell high. If long, only buy if APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY. If short, do whatever the fuck you want.
