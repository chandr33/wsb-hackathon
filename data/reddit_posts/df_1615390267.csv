**Ben Axler, Spruce Point’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer, commented:**

*“Booms and busts in stock prices are often greatest in speculative mining and technology plays that tantalize investors with optimistic revenue and profit outlooks, yet often stem from baseless claims and companies with a history of failure. We saw this in 2012 and have a proven record of calling out stock promotions in these sectors, namely* [*Liquidmetal Technologies*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprucepointcap.com%2Fliquidmetals%2F&amp;esheet=52393459&amp;newsitemid=20210310005665&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Liquidmetal+Technologies&amp;index=5&amp;md5=43166067031d8e9e41dbc62502038a2a) *(OTCBB: LQMT) and* [*US Antimony*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprucepointcap.com%2Funited-states-antimony-corp%2F&amp;esheet=52393459&amp;newsitemid=20210310005665&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=US+Antimony&amp;index=6&amp;md5=c523c7ea845b12f4e415ed07d1bd902d) *(AMEX: UAMY). We see extreme parallels between these promoted failures and American Battery Metals Corp. and Comstock Mining Inc. These companies appear to have hitched their wagon to investor enthusiasm for electric vehicle battery recycling, and their prospective plant’s proximity to Tesla and its Gigafactory in Nevada. We recommend investors exercise extreme caution at these extended valuations and urge shareholders to closely examine why we believe both companies are Strong Sells.”*

\*\*\*

**Spruce Point Report Overview**

We urge investors to review key findings in Spruce Point’s report and hold management accountable for answers to the following issues:

* **We believe optimistic claims for near-term revenues and profits from electric vehicle (“EV”) battery recycling are likely to disappoint long after insiders sell out and share prices correct.** After speaking with a renowned expert, we believe the EV battery recycling market will be slow to develop. There’s no existing infrastructure to recycle lithium-ion batteries, only a fraction of EVs are nearing end-of-life, most batteries are repurposed for other applications rather than recycled, and recycling is not currently economical as most key battery materials are not currently in short supply. ABML is making claims it can achieve $200 million of revenue and 78% net margin, while LODE is claiming $100 million of sale and $30 million of profit potential within three years. Our report dissects why investors should be incredibly skeptical of these claims given neither company has outlined exactly where the battery supply will come from, and who the customers will be. In addition, we believe neither management team has any prior experience in the battery recycling industry and is currently relying on recycling processes that have not been proven at commercial scale. In addition, a host of other environmental and regulatory permitting and approvals remain to be addressed.
* **A recent Freedom of Information (“FOIA”) request made in Fernley, Nevada contradicts management’s permitting claims.** To date, ABML has made a purchase of land in Fernley, but has been slowly walking back its timeline to have a fully operational battery recycling facility. Management recently said it is finalizing its permitting process with the city and that permits are in process. Yet, the City of Fernley, Nevada affirmatively stated that no applications or permits have been submitted to date on the parcel of land owned by ABML. ABML is still in the land entitlement phase.
* **We believe both management teams are promotional and have a demonstrated track record of failing investors’ expectations in past business ventures.** ABML’s CEO Doug Cole and Director Doug MacLellan have failed to disclose on their respective biographies associations with numerous failed business ventures. Most alarming, CEO Cole was a Director at Longwei Petroleum, an SEC-charged fraud, while Director MacLellan was Vice Chairman at AXM Pharma, a company the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order for financial reporting fraud. Investors should also be alarmed that ABML is using an increasing number of Investor Relations and Consulting firms to promote its story. We believe that not all of these consulting arrangements have been properly disclosed. With respect to LODE, we believe it failed on its gold and silver mining objectives. Investors should be aware that in 10 years as CEO, Corrado de Gasperis has raised $176 million of capital and accumulated $114 million of negative Free Cash Flow. In 2020, ahead of its claims to transition to a “green metal company” and the formation of LiNiCo, we believe red flags such as special bonuses to the CEO, a financial misstatement and identification of a material weakness, auditor dismissal, and a CFO resignation have emerged.
* **Conflicts of interest and limited management engagement.** Many of ABML’s executives have other business interests that we believe distract from the attention ABML requires. Most notably, we are concerned by ABML’s Chief Resource Officer Scott Jolcover, who is also a “consultant” to LODE and manages “all commercial transactions.” This is concerning given that LODE’s formation of LiNiCo places it in direct competition with ABML’s battery recycling ambitions. It should be noted that we believe Scott Jolcover is related to Jeffrey Jolcover, who was convicted of securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering. A local source in Nevada stated that Jeffrey Jolcover works with LODE’s largest shareholder, John Winfield, at D.W.C.",Spruce Point Capital Management Announces Investment Opinion,1.0,1615390693,jiddu007

Would it be really hard for me to create a Super PAC to buy some influence at these financial congressional hearings? How much would it cost me to buy this power up that every team in this level has? How much money would it cost in political contributions to get words like “strategic fails to deliver” “synthetic shares” and “required buy in” to come out of several politicians’ mouths? How much brainpower would it take me to get that power?

I know from personal experience that “the rule of law” is a joke, the US constitution is a joke, and the entire judiciary that creatively interprets it is a joke. They INVENTED “qualified immunity” for fuck’s sake!

99% of the totality of all decisions depend on the status of the players. The 2% left is just needed to maintain the facade that things are fair. And 1% is in there to go fuck yourself if you disagree.

To boomers, what I need to “win” in this Earth game is money and power. So I will play even more, and then figure out how to inoculate myself from the insatiable greed that infected them.

I’m tired of all the other teams completely controlling the narrative of what is going on and getting to choose the rules of the game. And fuck you, CNBC. Who owns you?I’m buying put options on them since they definitely seem like they have a vested interest in this war.

Anyway, my shift at Arby’s starts soon. You can bet your $ASS the boss will try to get me to buy 69 shares of $DLDO and sell my call options on $FART.

Happy Woman’s Day.
