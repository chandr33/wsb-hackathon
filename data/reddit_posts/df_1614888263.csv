53,lxu0rc,"I am not a financial advisor. My finical advice is my own.

I am feeling extremely bullish about WKHS, a company responsible for the creation of battery-powered/electric vehicles and airplanes. As of the past month, it has been brutally oversold and undervalued. Looking strictly at some basic financials, the company has an excellent long-term position to keep moving forward. Their recent loss on a contract with USPS made them take a major hit, and in the past month, they have dropped a whopping 60%. However, I personally think that electric vehicles like trucks are the future of transport. I imagine that in coming years, WKHS will land some massive deals that will skyrocket the stock given corporate greed to save money on gas by landing electric trucks for delivery. The stock is very undervalued right now at only $14.2 a share, and I am ready to YOLO my portfolio into it as a dumbass college student. I am extremely bullish about this stock, and I think you should be too.

I believe this is worth mentioning so there's some understanding and less bias and opposition among us.

Position disclosure:

Roughly 3/4 AMC, 1/4 GME. Was late to the party and could not afford GME at the time due to buying restrictions. Both, to the moon. Together.

**EDIT:** Not financial advice or disclosure of bias-- just an explanation and information someone with more wrinkles can make use of.

**EDIT 2:** ""new account"" cool. I use my main one for work in tech. Use it to work with our community and don't want to blend that with my financial stuff.

**EDIT 3:** ""What does this mean?""

It's data. Another resource for our more developed apes to interpret.

For me? If GME OR AMC squeezes, covering shorts in those 20 ETFs will likely send the latent symbol into a squeeze as well. It means another win condition for either side.
