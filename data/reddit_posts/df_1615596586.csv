45,m3vyog,"*Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I‚Äôve got good news for all ape-kind: I‚Äôve found one. Here‚Äôs my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let‚Äôs talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that‚Äôs insane growth. Most apes can‚Äôt even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That‚Äôs less than half the P/E of the S&amp;P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let‚Äôs talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven‚Äôt bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit ‚Äì it‚Äôs next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low‚Ä¶. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what‚Äôs caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood‚Ä¶ so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt ‚Äì Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn‚Äôt matter:** According to QFIN‚Äôs CEO, Wu ‚ÄúCock Slapper‚Äù Haisheng, *‚ÄúCurrently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.‚Äù* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem ‚Äì QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt ‚Äì Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China‚Äôs economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn‚Äôt matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we‚Äôve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn‚Äôt a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they‚Äôre receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They‚Äôre bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they‚Äôre bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren‚Äôt a bank. What‚Äôs even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN‚Äôs loans defaults to FINV‚Äôs, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you‚Äôre too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN‚Äôs historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, ‚ÄúTotal operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency‚Äù ‚Äì CFO Alex ‚ÄúOh God Please No Not My Face‚Äù Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt ‚Äì uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It‚Äôs also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I‚Äôm not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN‚Äôs loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite ‚Äì they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). ‚Äú...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.‚Äù ‚Äì Ethan ‚ÄúProlapse King‚Äù Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group ‚Äì a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack ‚ÄúActual Vampire‚Äù Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN‚Äôs stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie‚Äôs red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it‚Äôll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren‚Äôt convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

1. Pivot from brick &amp; mortar to digital which could lead to higher sales multiples
2. Their $3.5b stock buyback program which still has $600m to go and will run through June 2022 (for reference: their current market cap is $3.84b)

Today, H&amp;R Block announced 4 new Vice Presidents that will help drive the next phase of growth for the company. Among them are:

Karisa Booker, who previously led a complete consumer data transformation of AMC's marketing

Scott Runkel, who was head of product at Walmart and led the team responsible for ""defining quality standards for digital products."" 

These appointments reaffirm H&amp;R Block's commitment to a digital transformation.

In addition to pivoting to digital, I believe that HRB's new focus on small businesses will greatly improve its bottom line. Some of you might wonder, there over 200 million tax paying individuals in the USA but merely 30 million small businesses, why should they focus on small businesses?

I think the answer is quite simple: most **individuals only file their taxes once a year,** and there are plenty of free do-it-yourself options for them. On the other hand, **businesses pay taxes year-round.** Payroll, sales tax, income tax, bookkeeping, many of which will require services that could generate more revenue compared to individuals doing their income tax one time a year.

HRB is expected to bring in $3.55b of revenue in 2021. Currently, it has a PS ratio of **1.42**, compared to their competitor Intuit (TurboTax)'s **13.65**. Intuit Inc ($INTU) trades at $395 with a market cap of over $108b. There's no doubt in my mind that the upside will be tremendous if HRB can successfully pull off the transformation. 

HRB released earnings on March 8th and reported a -$1.17 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of -$1.29. The call transcript can be found [here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/09/hr-block-hrb-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/).

Fun Fact: HRB's CEO Jeff Jones was briefly the President of UBER in 2017 but quit during the #DeleteUber movement which took aim at the company's gender bias and toxic culture in the workplace. Jeff cited ""differences over beliefs and approach to leadership"" as his reason for resigning. Four years later, under Jeff's leadership, HRB scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index and is recognized as one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.""

77,m3w6ui,"Remember the squeeze in January that would've ran up to $1k+? (confirmed by Interactive Brokers CEO). And that $500 ceiling is where we need to break through to trigger exponents such as Gamma -&gt; Shorts covered.

There was an AI program predicting 100k+ full squeeze at 140% SI. This is the power of exponential growth - However this program is heavily extrapolated and doesn't take into account external factors such as Prisoners dilemma, there are also many probable flaws in the script.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img c48lf6xt7pm61...*

 Let's do some simple maths (correct me if i'm wrong i'm trash at maths), We have a ""realistic SI of 600%, a difference of 460% or 4.6x) now lets interpolate the squeeze from January; $148 -&gt; $347 -&gt; $483 -&gt; $1k+ (likely would've been higher), now lets extrapolate our current situation $265 -&gt; $ 621.3 (\[347/148\]x265) -&gt; $864.8 (\[483/347x621.3) -&gt; $1790+ (\[1,000/483\]x864x8). Now lets take into account the 4.6x short interest - 1790x4.6 = $8234+. Take this with a grain of salt. This calculation (like the AI model) is heavily extrapolated and does not take into account the situations present during the squeeze in January such as the 9 figure volume that drove GME up + Gamma squeeze we may or may not have the same factors in the same squeeze today. However what I can say for certain is that this squeeze will be LARGER than the one in January due to real SI being 600+% (remember exponential growth - the higher the SI the even greater the price).",Exponential growth - $8k+ minimum,1.0,1615599034,LongtheCrypto
