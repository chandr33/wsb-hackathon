But either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that ""hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!"", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**

So let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.

# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.

With COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster go out of business for good. 

Hedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**

While some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...

# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.

People like Michael Burry and Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.

After GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.

Finally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.

# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...

But before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *""short squeeze""* and *""gamma squeeze""* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""short squeeze"" is when lots of people ""short"" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.** 

**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A ""gamma squeeze"" happens when many people make lots of  ""call"" options with market makers for prices that very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**

**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.** 

**If this high volume of ""call"" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SKIP POINT

People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.

 **It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.** 

# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...

**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**

# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021

What was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.

# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.

Before more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous ""call"" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses. 

After all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.

In less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, even by illegal means, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...

# Yet this is not how GME ends.

Just a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again. 

Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing. 

During the same congress meeting, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**In other words, a ""short squeeze"" hasn't happened yet.**

People found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned. 

They found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.

Ryan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...

There were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...

People began exercising call options once more, and now...

# The GME rocket rises once again...

# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their ""call"" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.",A refresher on what the $#@! is going on with GME,1.0,1615349850,fortifier22

From Bloomberg

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roblox-direct-listing-reference-price-221415677.html


‚ÄúThe New York Stock Exchange set a reference price of $45 for the direct listing of Roblox Corp., the online games company that originally planned to go public via a traditional initial public offering.


Roblox‚Äôs shares will begin trading Wednesday without the company raising any capital. As with previous direct listings, the company won‚Äôt issue new shares at a set price. Instead, current investors can simply begin selling shares based on demand when trading opens.‚Äù

This means that current share holders who paid $2.50 a share can start selling at $45 per share, as long as demand holds up.  

Sooooo, therefore if we don‚Äôt buy it day one, we can buy it cheaper later on. . 

And their financials : 


For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Roblox had a consolidated net loss of $197 million on revenue of $614 million.

They pull in around 200m a QTR but overspend by about $60m a month.    Eeesh.  Huge losses.

Compare this to EA Games, which has a similar market cap ($30bln) but over the same period had sales of $4bln and net PROFIT of 900m (almost as much as RBLX‚Äôs total revenue).

Before plowing your wife‚Äôs boyfriends . . Money . . Into $RBLX take a careful compare / contrast w other companies in the same industry.  Hugely profitable and popular Minecraft sold for $10 bln.  Is $RBLX really worth $30 BLN day 1 with 0 earnings?

30,m1p9vl,"I bought SNDL in May at $0.60 next day it went to $1.50 and came back down to $0.50 and I was patient all summer. Bought more this fall and have been buying more on the way up including some over $3 recently. Cost basis is probably $1.25-$1.50. This is not financial advice. 

Sundial is reporting earnings on March 17th. At that time they will have near $800 million cash on and no debt. Analysts will update their estimates and price targets a week or two after earnings which could
be another catalyst. 

Deal news is very likely, either an acquisition or merger, possibly to break in the US market. I love the Indiva deal from February ($11 million equity and $11 million preferred debt). Indiva owns terrific gummie brands that are all over the US Market already including WANA gummies. 

SNDL has terrific long term fundamental metrics. Anyone who values weed companies on a revenue multiple is a motley clown. Sndl cut 50% of workforce in 2020 to focus on profitability and transitioned from strictly growing to more of a direct retail presence which has much higher margins and lower revenue. It‚Äôs competitors dump all their cash into revenue and advertising and it‚Äôs not comparing apples to apples.

Sundial is doing all of the small things right. This company that could have double or triple its current revenue if it liked burning cash but it doesn‚Äôt and turned a normalized operating profit last quarter. In an up-and-coming budding industry it‚Äôs easy to say weed stocks are overvalued but get ready for the long term train üöÇ , it won‚Äôt look back. 

Weed üå± is the new alcohol and cigarettes combined, and the industry is about to break into drinks. Recreational and medical marijuana use will eclipse alcohol sales in 30 years. 

Sundial stock went down last year from $13 because their first grow at the large indoor facility wasn‚Äôt done well and they had mold issues and had to write off profit. They addressed the issue, changed management, put in new processes and stock went down 40 fold. 

They said it about amzn and tsla when things were small. Get ready. I predict we get to $5 then $10 this year. Buy the equity, not the options! Short sellers often sell options and make money by keeping the price flat until options expire. Don‚Äôt let them do this and buy the equity instead. 

I owned fcel and bngo before they took off and was astonished with their run. SNDL could absolutely do the same thing. Things take time and it may be a rocky road but the company is setup for huge success in the future. It will likely get acquired in next 5 years anyway. The market judges potential as much as results and SNDL brings massive amounts of both.

82,m1piio,"My brother told me about GME at the end of January when things were going wild. He's unemployed so he gambled what he could lose and got one share at $240. I joined this subreddit and started ""researching"" the memes. I bought my first share at $270 and thats all RH would let me buy.

I talked to my sister that weekend about all the meme research and she had a TD ameritrade account and with a couple thousand available to invest in it. I didnt give her any financial advice but she went ahead and bought 10 shares of GME at $298. 

Then the price dropped. My brother went FUD paper hands and sold his share at $90. What a loser.

I sold off the few shares of some energy stocks I owned and bought more GME til I was had 7.4 shares @ $155.

My sister and I swore to stay diamond hands til it rocketed back to the moon. 

Its been a wild ride for the last month and a half and my sister and I have had some great conversations about our investing and great laughs about our little brother that was too scared to hold on. 

Today my sister told me that with price rising she put in a limit sell order on 9 of her shares at $245 to cut her losses but she would diamond hand the last share either to the moon or to the grave. She had 10 @ 298 and sold 9 @ 245. For her to get back to even the last share has to get to $775. This means GME will officially have a ceiling of $774. Those are the facts because she doesnt to get to be a winner now.

TL:DR Plan an exit strategy around $770/share, its all downhill after that.",GME ceiling technical analysis,1.0,1615351189,BB_Captain

Important: I own two trading accounts, RH(i keep it for option trading) and Ameritrade(**option trading is not activated yet**)

&amp;#x200B;

**Event 1 =Market Crash - RH Locked - February 23rd**

 I bought a few GME contracts after I saw DFV double down. Market crashed and I bitched out - see attached image. RH got locked since I day traded frequently with balance below $25,000.

**Event 2 = NEW HOPE - Bought 480 shares @ average $53 before the gamma squeeze**

I couldn't buy calls on RH before the squeeze so I bought shares on **Ameritrade**. This seems like the new hope. 

I was frustrated on the fact I couldn't buy calls before the squeeze and FOMO.

Once we're at the top at around $160/share I decided to be a smartass and try to outsmart the market, but in return I became the market's bitch. Lost around $10,000 trying to buy low sell high. 

Got frustrated and sold everything

**Event 3 = Put everything into 3/19 Calls  300c and market crash again**

After activating option trading on Ameritrade, I decided to Yolo it and put everything onto Calls. The fucking market crash AGAIN. I FOMO from GME into the new hype RKT and we all know what happened then. I bitched out after I saw my life savings go from $40,000 ---&gt; $12,000. 

**Event 4 = Ameritrade Locked with balance under $25,000**

I tried withdrawing money from Ameritrade and moving it into Interactive Broker and Webull. It takes A FUCKING WEEK for the deposit to settle. Currently I can't trade.

I'm starting over. This time smarter than before. Hopefully no more weak hands and no more FOMO.
