10,m4cka9,"This will be long apes so please bull with me. This is going to be a breakdown of GME's chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going. I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts. I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines, but I'll try to make it easy to understand.

**Technical breakdown:**

On the 20 day chart, we can see that GME is going up in a stair-step pattern, which is obviously extremely bullish. A stair-step pattern is where it rises up, consolidates lightly, then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stair-step. We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stair-step. As you can see, the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support. This is bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sacw2jztcum61.png?width=2218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b

Next, and probably one of my favorite things, is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180, we had STRONG support at the 180 level, which, as I said above, was the resistance from the first step, which is now our support. Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support. A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend (in this case up). This is extremely bullish, dare I say... apeish. The orange lines show the pennant pattern that I'm talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern (lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls). It's important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon, the pennant could just extend, so do not think that it's going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could, it could also just continue consolidating:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5q6m693wcum61.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a

When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising, the green line above should act as support for our next stair step, which would put us at 350ish for support, which is huge.

For the 90 day chart, you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern, which is how we got into the current bullish movement. Those lines are yellow:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7gwk7ocxcum61.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960

Finally, in the chart above, I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance. These are the fat green, yellow, and red lines. I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze.

**What to take away from the chart action:** we are currently in a consolidation period of a stair-step pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze. This is very ~~bullish~~ apeish. Again, I apologize for all the lines, I'm a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain.

**Volume**: everyone is talking about the squeeze, shorts, and price action, and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME. The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume. I know that people don't like the VW comparison (and I'm not comparing them here, just using this as an example), but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iiet237zcum61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785

As far as GME's current volume, we are not there (but don't get down on it becuase WE WILL BE). The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly, forcing them to cover. In the previous squeeze, volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying. The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didn't shut of buying, why? Volume. So, for GME's volume, it's plain and simple, it needs to increase (but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more ~~bullish~~ apeish).

**But Hank, how does volume increase?** Excellent question, tard brain. For GME, and most stocks but especially GME, catalysts are what drives volume up. Below is a picture of GME's volume since the January action:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rcu25cl0dum61.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2

The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake (but the jump wasn't super significant). The first big spike that you can see is on January 11-13ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board. In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump in volume (lots of red) is when Andrew Left of shitron had his week-long down-syndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB. This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets ""Gamestonk,"" Chamath buys a bunch of calls, and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support. We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us. The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO (many thought that Ryan Cohen led this). We then see volume decrease a little. Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company. Volume has since gone down a little, but the price has gone up (erection!).

**What to take from this**: Plain and simple, volume is king. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's boss's wife's boyfriend. We cannot have another squeeze without volume, BUT volume, especially in GME's case is greatly correlated with catalysts.

**Volume Catalysts**: Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need: GME appointing a new CFO, GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO, better than expected earnings, an acquisition, support/investment from big names (i.e. Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc), new committees/initiatives/anything relating to their digital transformation, quadruple witching day March 19th (still not sure how I feel about this and definitely don't think it's the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help). Overall, it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation. Personally, I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces he's gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move, that will give us the volume we need. It's important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen (and why wouldn't he, his net worth is tied to it) as evident by the tweets that he's put out that, though cryptic, seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts. Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too (this is just speculation tho, I'm tard).

**TTM Squeeze and MACD**: Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze. I don't wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day, but they essentially indicate momentum. On my charts, I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACD's histogram. As you can see, on the 1-year chart, the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now. What I'm more excited about is the TTM squeeze (the colorful bars). In a TTM squeeze indicator, the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum (it's in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels). When the bars turn dark blue, there is still bullish momentum, but it's fading. The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum. As you can see, are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars. For a TTM Squeeze, there are usually 7-10 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern. From the last squeeze, you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones. This indicates that we are currently in the middle of/approaching giant price action, but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable, high arching uptrend. If you're thinking, ""oh man Unlce Hank, we've already had 5 light blue bars, the squeeze is almost over"" - not so fast tard. Though I said that there's usually 7-10 of these bars in an uptrend, that's not always the case, and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars. Overall, all this should show you is that yes, we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect. This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that it's giving us INSANELY good signs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4jopywl2dum61.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac7c78bc7fcea8092f966f5a73c8fb5017f2ece

**A note about squeezes:** Let me be clear, if the brokerages wouldn't have cut off buying, this would have gone up past $1000 (IB CEO said this and he's a boomer-cuck). Because of this, last time was not a short squeeze, it was a gamma squeeze (or a series of them). A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume. Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles (see the Volkswagen pattern for this). A short squeeze does not happen over time, it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside. Gamma squeezes, on the other hand, can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks. It's important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes (it's a feedback loop, which is why it's so dangerous). So, currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume.

**Shorts:** A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest. Some say it's 13%, 27%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 120%, and well above 200% (I've even seen 900%). IMO, it's impossible to know right now. FINRA's release said it was about 50% and that's the one that I believe to be the most likely (definitely don't believe FINRA's 27% assplay). HOWEVER, it's important to note that those 100%+ numbers very well could be correct. The reason for this is because they can't take into consideration naked shorts (if you don't know about this there are 100s of DDs about it). So, IMO there are 2 scenarios here: 1. It's literally just 50%ish short interest on GME. Let me be clear, THIS IS STILL HUGE. Anything above 30% is huge, so 50% is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME. 2. It's actually above 200%. If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100% happen and will also probably crash the financial system because, as we know from 2008, when institutions get into these shady, unregulated derivative bets on volatile things, it usually creates a collateral effect. Personally, I have no clue which one is correct. The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are. However, it begs the question, ""why are they still doing this?"" The answer to this is they are either retarded (and not in a good way), doing it out of anger and spite (and we all know how well emotional trading goes), or they are in a bind and can't get out of it. Personally, I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true. If it's extremely true, then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases. If it's false, then we still have 50% short interest, apes, and Daddy Cohen. **TL:DR on this paragraph:** short numbers are conflicting and it's impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true. Either way, I like the stock.

**Closing thots:** The most important thing, as I said, is fucking volume. This is not just gonna magically happen. Sure, the price could very well keep increasing over the coming days/weeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen, but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst, we are not going to see the short squeeze. REMEMBER, the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time. I'm talking trading getting halted 5+ times in a single day on the upside. Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important, yes, especially next week and earnings week, but do I think it's over if not, fuck no! So with that being said, please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because they're disappointed. Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen, that it's a possibility, not that it's the endgame or a certainty. Finally, continued talk about GME, continued buying and holding, and continued retardation are key. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN.

**TL;DR**: I Like the stock.","GME Technicals, DD, short interest",0.92,1615661357,HomeDepotHank69

The price rocketed to $34.94 in February, but has since fallen with a lot of other tech stocks. This is the time to buy.

They offer their printers as a Hardware as a Service model, which I may personally dislike, but the lower up front cost is a benefit to consumers when printers can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $120,000. And if the desktop metal printer can make end use metal parts IN AN OFFICE, then manufacturing firms are going to want one. I know I do.

Last year a 5 part mini-series was released by a fan animator called the Astarte's project, It released to massive acclaim whilst being only 15 minutes long in total, if you are aware of the 40K universe and story that is part of the main line of games workshop products you have probably seen this and its my bet that you think its the best animation that has ever come out of that IP.

On April 2nd 2020 the final part was released and at the same time the value of the stock skyrocketed doubling its value in 2 and a half months alone. going from $4000 - $8000. currently its sitting just under 10K  after peaking at 12K in November and is in position to swing either way.

Roughly 2 days ago games workshop announced that they had officially hired the guy to work on more animations along with a handful of other lesser known but still greatly skilled fan animators that are loved in the community. This recent news is in my opinion a good sign of an upswing, along with their recent and ongoing collaboration with marvel, for better or for worse, it seems quite popular.

Warhammer has been on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream for years and years, but I believe with this recent news we could expect gains real soon, particularly the Astarte's project news, back when it released it attracted a whole range of new fans to the IP, simply on the quality of the animation alone.

And to further tickle the pickle of anyone on the fence, they pay good dividends!

88,m4de3q,"Back when GME first popped, I identified the cock and balls pattern, predicting an increase to $400. This post was rule 14'd. I was, however, right.  Now, I am here to tell yall apes about the 3D cock bullish pattern and predict a price.

[Here's a screengrab from the OG post](https://preview.redd.it/kqlzmll1qqm61.png?width=2374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a8e7fff997c33e8b75d181f3c5107adde3e8f2)

Let's take a break from the daily ups and downs and zoom out ok?

This will allow us to see the bigger picture and analyze long-term patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

[Google Finance cuz I'm an ape](https://preview.redd.it/ykffw98aqqm61.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a03418422872edb2986af7fc639db4c8c76f4ad5)

Here is the thing; unless you have had a cripplling case of testicular torsion, you probably have either 0 or 2 balls. Let's focus on the second case. If you look at a $400 megacock from the side, you can only see 1 ball. This is because the ape brain is limited to 2D. But...

[TWO BALLS.](https://preview.redd.it/69pcxfhhium61.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd0f871ba045c72160e24564229c82b497ab0be)

Therefore, the chart is now showing us a 3D cock pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

[WOW WOW NO WAY! Notice the tattoos.](https://preview.redd.it/wy2r8rf5jum61.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06726824f782cf085a4afa0b99e491f5cbb130e0)

Now yall wondering, how high will the new cock hit? It's simple. Remember, volume is measured in m\^3. To convert a 2D object into 3D, we will multiply by the width. We can tell the walls are about 3x the previous balls so it will be a $1600 squeeze in 2D. But in 3D, we need to multiply by width. I measured your Wife's Boyfriend's cock and it is a $5 bill across. Therefore, we multiply $1600 by $5=8000. But WAIT. We multiplied two dollar signs. Thats MEANS 8000 dollars squared. What does that mean? GME  TO THE FUCKING MOON!
