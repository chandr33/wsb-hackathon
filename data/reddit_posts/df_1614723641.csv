https://www.bendonlingerie.co.nz/pleasure-state-my-fit-arch-thong-brief-black-p37-4107f

Now tell me what you think.  The lingerie is hot and the model is hot.  If nakd can pull this off, then I find their stock is a steal right now.  My wife bought similar lingerie but a lot more expensive.  I will definitely recommend her to buy this piece and others next time she shops.  

But really when you look at the quality of models, type of intimates, and other clothing, this is a real deal.  My DD says they're refocused online sales.  I never heard of NAKD or WSB until I heard it on the news last month.  I joined because I believed in what WSB stands for.  

Hedge funds are trying to close these companies and these bastards are wrecking quality clothing like this.  What we are going to be left is buying crap at walmart and who really wants to buy lingerie at walmart?  It's probably been worn and returned.

But seriously, NAKD is sexy. The lingerie is sexy. The models are sexy. 

This is not advise but rather I know sexy when I see sexy and this is sexy!

To all MAXD Shareholders and those that want to be:

\*\*FACT:\*\*In 2011, when Google‚Äôs annual sales were reported at $39.7 Billion dollars, Larry Page and Sergy Brin it‚Äôs founders approved an Executive Summary that stated that Mr. Attia‚Äôs technology was worth $120 Billion dollars annually to Google. (Google is making lots of money on the IP)

\*\*FACT:\*\*On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia‚Äôs intellectual property rights. (VALID STILL)

\*\*FACT:\*\*On March 1, 2017, at Google's request, Max Sound Management met with Google Representatives to mediate the Attia matter. At the end of the day, no settlement agreement was reached, and Max Sound agreed to leave the mediation negotiations open while the case continued. (WHY AS FOR NEGOTIAONS IF YOUR NOT GUILTY?)

All of the postponing and legal positioning was at Google's behest to try and discredit MAXD and have them removed from representing the case. Why? Because it would be easier to make it all disappear if MAXD was not involved. Google's legal options are exhausted, they have basically admitted guilt and their damage control is not working.

37,lwea4x,"My first DD. There are a number of upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive sentiment about long term prospects. Figured I would help provide snippets of info for people just now hearing about the company. 

- March 22, UWMC will be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. This was announced this morning. These inclusions always mark a price increase. Furthermore, there is potential for this to be added to the S&amp;P 500. 

More info on a possible index squeeze here: https://yetanothervalueblog.com/2021/01/quickie-idea-uwmc-squeezing-higher-post-despacing.html

- March 9 is the Ex-div date. May see a small run up. The company also stated that it may provide a special dividend in the future, like RKT is doing. Even more potential profits/price increase if that happens. 

- Pretty good 0.4 dividend over the course of the year. 

- Analyst EOY ratings range from $10.50 to $14. Average is $12.33. All are bullish. 

https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/do-analysts-agree-tuesday-on-uwm-holdings-corp-uwmc-stocks-target-price

- 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.

- UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop. 

- Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.

- Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months. 

- Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn‚Äôt allow the stock to drop so low again. 

This is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don‚Äôt think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don‚Äôt see these concerns as significant right now. And I want to keep this DD short.

However brigading and downvoting other threads that have very well written DD just because they aren't GME is a detriment to this subreddit.

Quite frankly I was unsure if I wanted to post this because popular posts don't give me the time to properly research a company before I open a position, but I think it is unfair for the community.

Some amazing plays missed these past weeks:

[Workhorse will not get the USPS contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lheq8x/wkhs_dd_zero_chance_of_winning_a_significant/) by  [u/Thereian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Thereian/). This amazing DD has less than 400 upvotes. If you had bought puts following his advice, you'd have done where from **10x-60x** (in puts) your initial investment.

[Amazing part 3 of 3 DD on RKT](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/) by  [u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020/) that has less than 650 upvotes. If you opened a position the next day you'd have made anywhere from 10x-30x your investment buying calls, or just 2x buying shares. (Also can we unban this guy, apparently he is banned due to not posting GME content).

90,lweerz,"I just wanted to finally say something to you ü¶ç!! I first got into $GME because on Christmas time 2020 I went to pick up my boy a new game. As I look at the GameStop sign from my car waiting on my wife I think WTF what‚Äôs $150 on 10 stocks in the middle of a pandemic a video game store has to be making money!! I did NO DD!! Bought it!! I forgot about it until I‚Äôm watch the news one day and see it got to $400!! I did t sell even then. But I heard of this sub so a joined!! Now because of y‚Äôallüíéüôå and some of your üìÑüôå post and I pulled a $1500 profit off an option and bought more $GME because I love the stock!! Keep in mind I‚Äôve NEVER DONE OPTIONS. Until I came here and also some DD!! 

TL;DR I love y‚Äôall apes!! ü¶çüí™üíéüôå $GME to the üöÄmoon!!

Why because I really do love the stock!!",Old but new,1.0,1614724417,CurbNasty
91,lweetq,"About RKT. Love you RKT idiots and I truly am happy for you. That being said, the RKT megathread came directly after the incredibly late (9am-ish) GME thread and was promoted by the mods via a stickied comment that took up half the mobile screen. ‚ÄúRKT was the most talked about yesterday..‚Äù It sounded like straight up promotion. 

GME‚Äôs thread was opened by u/bawse1 and we appreciate that but the entire mod teams needs to fully UNDERSTAND how importing setting the comments to sort by NEW is. Not doing so kills the hype. I have to go into the thread, sort by new and minimize the RKT promo in order to have a decent experience.

What EXACTLY will be done with the threads from now on and why did the entire mod team ignore constant tags to open a GME thread all the way until market open?",Mods: We are owed answers.,1.0,1614724421,realpersonnn

94,lwef55,"What are some of your favorite shorts? and why?

Just like veggies shorts are necessary part of summer wardrobe. Here is my favorite shorts: CVS. This post is about **sharing your thoughts.** Almost exclusively people here talk about longs. We need healthy short discussions too.

I don't claim that **CVS is the best short**. It's a shitty company which relies on its insurance business to drive customers to its pharmacies. People are already buying what they would from CVS and there is not much room for earnings growth except increasing prices. Increasing prices usually benefits manufacturers. Amazon is about to launch its real pharmacy business. PillPack in its current state isn't Amazon's competition to Pharmacies. I'm also bearish on **GoodRx**. Amazon will negate the necessity of coupon codes for pharmacies. GoodRx is nothing more than Groupon for drugs. At 17 Billion it is valued at more than 17 times Rite Aid. Imagine. The coupon is worth 17 times the store. lol. My only worry is that Guggenheim has a buy rating on it.   Their lockup period is coming to an end in 3 weeks. Per SensorTower, GoodRx downloads in February were down 46% y/y (vs down 32% y/y in January) and down 28% m/m. There is regulatory risk for both of the mentioned companies and I just don't see them coming ahead. Also if pharmacies stop accepting GoodRx and replacing it with their own discount coupons then GoodRx is toast.

96,lwefjm,Here me out. Many hedge funds have written options (calls and puts for GME). Because the volatility in GmE is so high the premiums on these options are very expensive ( see for 800 calls are still 500$ for a batch of 100). If this stock goes sideways for the next month these options (calls and puts) will expire and be 100% profit for the writers of the options. It seems to me this is how it will go before exploding either up or down,GME move sideways for a bit???,1.0,1614724479,Fuckrobinhood44
