I am the guy that sends all the funny memes to my friends and have gotten some of them turned on to r/wsb. I don't even look at any other apps for entertainment anymore just reddit. I laugh with my fellow apes and have found a group I can totally relate too without knowing anyone of you all personally. We just get each other. And you know what I get and understand? Is that you don't want to mess with a group of retards. Retard strength is unbeatable. When I played high school football there was a guy on my team that was smaller and dumber than everyone else but he had what we called retard strength. Even though you knew the bigger guy was going to throw him around and rag doll him he would just get up each play unphased, unbothered, and would still run full speed 100% headfirst into the guy again, again, and again. This is us buying the dip everytime. Does it make sense to buy more when everyone else tells you not too? No. But that's the point we're retarded and don't know better. And that's a scary thing to people who want us to do the reasonable thing like sell because ""it's smart to take profits"".

55,m3kf53,"I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. These are simply my own ideas. Read them, do your due diligence, and come to your own conclusions.

1) DFV didn't cash out at 350, why? I wonder if the guy who has been studying GME for well over a year, and put his money where his mouth is, knows what he is doing.

2) ""If you still believe in the reason you bought the stock, and that hasnt changed, why sell ?"" - Mark Cuban

3) Cohen + his team started chewy from nothing to compete against Amazon. The team now arrives at GME where their competition is who? Valve? Newegg? Amazon? They also arrive at a company with a rich presence across America and an already loyal customer base of 50+ million. (Chewy had 17.8 million users in December)

4) Stimulus checks arriving soon for middle america, I wonder where this huge infusion of cash is going to be going? 300,000 users reading this subreddit right now...

5) Time in the market is on average both easier and better than trying to time the market. The best price point to enter GME is either months ago or today. DM me if you get a time machine running. If you try to sell high then buy back in low for free money, you will lose money. You're trading against firms with billion dollar algorithms that process millions of dollars worth of data in fractions of seconds. You might time it right once or twice, but if you repeat it on a long enough scale, you will lose to the house. Think of it like long term gambling at a casino, the house always wins in the end. It is so much easier to just invest and hold. 

6) THE INFINITE GAMMA+SHORT SQUEEZE!!1! I personally believe this has been WAY overhyped by delusional gmetards with only 2 shares who spam diamond hands and have pipe dreams of becoming millionaires off their first trade. If you genuinely believe GME can go to 500,000 a share, I have a bridge to sell you. I encourage all of you to look up the leader of the ""enemy"" at Citadel, Kenneth Griffin. Read his wikipedia page. The man does. not. lose. If you think he is going to just roll over and lose to a bunch of guys who eat crayons and wash it down with their own piss, I have no words. Having said all of that, there is no denying that there is upward pressure which is always nice. Just try to avoid getting lost in the sauce of an infinite money glitch. 

7) Have an exit strategy, even if that strategy is never exiting. Psychology is a fickle thing. Try to avoid being caught off guard when it comes time to turn your hands into paper. Let it be on your own terms, not theirs. If you believe in the short/gamma squeeze, you will 100% know when it has happened. There will be no doubts ""are we there yet"". 

8) You do not lose until you sell for a loss. If the price tanks, guess what? You are now long GME. You should hold for a year+ and see what Cohen can do with the company. If you are reading this and thinking to yourself ""but I can't afford to hold for a year"" then you are retarded and should get out while you can. This last point is the reason why I personally have no fears throwing money at the company. I am okay leaving it there for over a year. If you are okay with that, ANY price point is a good entry point.

Looking for breakout here.  


With a lot of **hype** and **news** on this ticker, ZOM has a good chance of continuation.. but the question is; When?  


We have been consolidating in the 1.90 - 2.15 range for a couple days. As we stand now, we are getting a chance to break the resistance and be on our way.  


**Currently holding 1/4 size position -**  
**If we reject this level and head back to \~1.80 , I will average down.**  
**If we break the resistance, my entry for other 1/2 is set @ 2.20**  


Breakout will happen soon, don't miss it.
