I was looking at the RKT options chain when I noticed this:

https://imgur.com/a/7CeFjbW

Now to my eye, as of the current price, that looks like quite a few options that are ITM RIGHT now.

With all the news about the special dividend, the billion dollar buyback, the CEO's pure hatred of shorts, and UWMC's war on RKT, I think that RKT just may, just could, pop up again.

RKT is currently STILL undervalued even with the revised (and suspect) price target of $30 and the attention is now fully on it after the recent spike into the $40's.

This looks RIPE for a gamma squeeze again.

40,ly0d4m,"Hey guys,

So recently I was thinking..

Hedge funds want to protect themselves from a future GME incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through WSB and see what stocks are gaining momentum. The problem is that it’s extremely easy to parse through Reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned. So, I was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots (potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies) 

Why don’t we create a program that converts text to images that can’t be parsed so easily.. kind of like a captcha system that bots can’t easily win. This will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage. As we know timing is essential here. 

Obviously, it’s easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through WSB and find the next stock that gains momentum; but that takes significantly more time; there has to be a solution here too .. I just don’t know what it is.

Whatever the case, I WONT be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through Reddit to protect themselves. Let’s at least give them a major headache!


Edit: sharing ideas on a forum shouldn’t be illegal. Algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be ILLEGAL. I want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over. That’s all I’m saying.

Edit #2: Potentially we can use ReCaptcha something that’s has been out for a long time (Google has developed this over many years) before allowing access to any DD.

Edit #3: I really like this suggestion by /u/TheLegendDevil: “One way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker. Easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about.”",How to beat hedge fund algorithms on WSB: a proposal,0.95,1614906514,2DAMOONWITHDD

Hi there, long time autist (since childhood) first time poster.

First: Sea shanties are big this year. Where do you sing a sea shanty? On a ship, what's a type of ship? Oh that's right, a Corsair.

Corsair gaming is a manufacturer of computer hardware and gaming peripherals.

CRSR share price has declined consistently over the past month despite beating expectations for Q4 and being rated as a buy by the majority of analysts (median target price is mid $40s). In addition the HFs have begun to flood in and have shorted over 21% of float. All together this seems rather retarded that the stock is down to $31.03 in after hours trading as I write this.

In the coming weeks the CFO is going to take part in several investor conferences.

The D.A. Davidson annual consumer conference on 3/11

The Macquarie consumer bright ideas conference on 3/16

The Wedbush play to win conference on 3/16

My question is, do you guys really think a stock market injection is going to fix any of the concerns we're having now?

Hello apes! Welcome to the bear market. In this episode, I am going to help you how to how to protect your portfolio by playing long runs and shorts falls.

The two products that we are going to talk about is call and put options. Any stocks that have more than 10 Billion dollar market cap are facing a hard correction right now. Especially the EV and tech stocks. Why? When SPY hit 395 we all suspected there will be a correction but didn't speculate when. unfortunately, folks at SPY included tsla when it was at it's prime, as a result many chinese EVs were are overbought because of the hype. Retailers like me want a quick buck. So after the EV and tech reached at a good value people started selling off. \[do not listen to media for bond crap\].

As a result, many people's portfolios got hit badly. But by playing a little strategy we can cut our losses and gain big as the market starts recovering.

\[For this we need webull or such software where we can see the quote and chart of an option call/put\]

&amp;#x200B;

let's take NIO's $45 strike 03/19/2021 call option.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j64fi81xz3l61.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53752e78731c7cdb38c0754f87aaa55ef64628b0

I have indicated the lowest buy-in of that option. As you can see two times Nio's call price has dipped and backed up tremendously. if you bought at the end you could end up with 200% gain even in the bear market.

but how can you precisely get in at that price?

1. Target a strike price (15-30 days expiration) which is OTM by 10-15%. (not more than that) if that strike price is currently at 1.50, make a limit buy at $0.80-$0.90 (always 40-50% less ) if there's an extreme market selloff your limit can get in. Remember to see at your targeted profit level. Let' say 50-100% depends on your risk tolerance.

Remember when the market oversells, new money flows in for opportunity, as within 2/3 days the market will stabilize. if you buy an option at that time, you might risk hitting loss. Sell your contract when the market stabilizes for quick gains.

You can also do this in the bull market but the strategy will be reversed.

Do not be greedy. Profit is profit even it's $1. Remember Opportunities will come, but money will not.

Here are some contract options to backup my theory:

Here are some cold facts about AMC:

1. AMC Short Interest is now a whopping +10%
2. The OI on options expiring 3/19 are ENORMOUS. The value is nearly HALF that of Apples.
3. AMC is still a massively shorted stock, one of the most in the whole market. 
4. AMC is reopening dozens and dozens of cinemas tomorrow in many cities: one of the biggest being in San Francisco.
5. The fucking FUNDAMENTALS haven't changed! AMC &amp; GME have ALWAYS been the cause. We LIKE these stocks.

The feeling of having people laugh alongside you, the thrill of grabbing popcorn and sinking into the leather chairs, watching a new release on a big screen. Fuck the Netflix. That's for lazy zoomers who want instant depressing gratification. So fuck the bearish sentiment on AMC. I don't care. I support our cinemas with my cash, and will fucking HOLD until you apes eventually come back to your original mission.
