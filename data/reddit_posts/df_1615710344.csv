In this article, the author tries to conflate put options with short selling. They claim short selling has an expiration date and that the hedge funds were forced to cover because their put options were expiring.

That isn't how this shit works.

I've only just started trading options, but even \*I\* know if you buy put options you're only risking the premium you pay. If the stock moons, your options just expire worthless and you're out the premium that you paid.

How in the nine hells of journalistic malpractice did this actually get published?

The author then says the trading activity was all bots and that social media is a threat.

Author is the CEO of some cloud bullshit who has no clue about investing or options gambling.

If you pull hard enough you get 1000 banana, if they manage to get your grip loose and win, they get your 1 banana. Seems fair because risk vs reward of going against several opponents by yourself balances it out. But it doesn't, the hedgies are using every trick disposable to them to get you to loosen your grip; they let go of the rope for a bit and then let the big fat anchor hedgie pull as soon as you try to gain ground. Yet you do not falter.
Why? Because you are an ape. An ape knows they are not alone in this cause, they simply tighten their grip and HOLD onto their dear lives. The hedgies continue and continue but not a single whiff of your banana is in their grasp. Eventually after all their tricks, their pussy hands are bleeding- they cannot hold on anymore. You pull forward and one by one the hedgies fall and the 1000 bananas they owe are yours...
But you do not let go of the rope. No no, in fact you tighten your grip and HOLD and pull like you've never before. The hedgies have been screwing with you this whole time. All their dirty tricks, you want to make them pay. As you keep pulling the rope, and the last chungus of a hedgie falls, you notice that their rope does not end. In fact it is an endless rope full of bananas along the way. You pull and HOLD and pull and HOLD and you keep getting more and more bananas. 2000, 5000, 10000, 50000, it just keeps going and going. Eventually you take your fill of bananas and decide to leave as a bananillionaire!
You were able to squeeze the hell out of the rope because you knew 1000 was not enough. Because you held, you got many, many more bananas than you thought was possible.

This is not financial advice, I simply like allegories.

$SQQQ

$40 Calls

Through theta decay, delta, other greeks and implied volatility, a mere 700% increase in $SQQQ, would yield 2200%+ returns with these calls (on the date of expiration)

The reason behind choosing these calls:
- I wanted at least 6 quarters of decay and runout on my calls.
- I had figured that the technology sector would be the hardest to fall in the events of a market collapse.

Can anyone find any derivatives with the same requirements, that would yield a bigger return?

Canoo Inc. AKA $GOEV is an EV automaker whose claim to fame is developing a highly customizable electric skateboard chassis allowing it to quickly adapt vehicle designs to specific applications with a high degree of customizability. They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.  Canoo Inc also excels at punishing the visionary longs as you must wait for 3 months outside the temple of Zen before they let you in No more suffering GOEV only tendies and gainz posting now. 

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than weekly Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money this weekend and BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing. 

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MDPV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. **Trend Reversal.**

After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".  Depending on the catalyst that brings that exposure we could see millions of shares being scooped up. Note the comparable amount of the rest of comparable stocks. Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

In other news Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.  The only problem is that the 200 mile range might not be enough to find the share price at the bottom of the chart.  She's just a attention grabbing vaporware empty bag holdin... Wait what? What? **Breaking news!** Ark picked us up..

She's a **genius**. Truly visionary with her approach.

# Monday is Roth , Partner Announcement would be cool.

But lets be real and get to know the bear perspective.

""Roth could end up being fruitful, but it'd be the first time they released material info at a conference/round table like this since I started following them And since they revealed the MPDV in Dec they've been stone fucking silent So I worry they're going to drag their feet on providing any new info before 4/16And the only reason I think they'd hold those numbers for an extended period of time is if they weren't as good as they wanted them to be prior to announcing them Few weeks after revealing MPDV and opening up US pre-orders, they opened it up to Canada and Mexico too. Out of the blue. Felt like they wanted to juice the numbers.$100 deposit, fully refundable, so people will hate on them being true pre-orders""

Its like were at the action sequence of the movie and we just got done killing the monster, but there's still 30 minutes left in the film.  I'm feeling good.

I want to end with some wild speculation from the man that leaked the ChadTruk in the first place.

38,m4rhtt,"Hello fellow apes,

As I sit here on Saturday evening twiddling my thumbs eagerly awaiting market open on Monday, I can‚Äôt help but think about the attitude change I saw on Friday (12th).

A lot of people were expecting a huge jump in share price on Friday (shoutout to the guy who made 800c for Friday) and a lot of people were uneasy about the closing price, or sceptical that the squeeze isnt even going to happen if the price on Friday didn‚Äôt get up over $300.

Now there‚Äôs a hell of a lot more hype for the 19th for the squeeze to happen and I‚Äôm concerned that if it doesn‚Äôt happen on that day, a lot of people will give up on GME.

The simple thing is is that we don‚Äôt exactly know the exact time/date of when the squeeze will happen. The 19th is a pretty good speculation for it to occur but it‚Äôs just that, a speculation. It may happen on the following Monday, or a week from Friday, we just don‚Äôt know.

Although I see the value in creating hype in GME for the 19th, I just feel a bit uneasy about if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt happen on the 19th and a lot of people start questioning GME as a whole like we saw on Friday but to an even greater extent.

Love love seeing how people adopting and helping our fellow ape friends, but here‚Äòs the real deal:

Most of the bad people and companies who cut down the trees to Tarzan around are doing it to make room for planting food crops for farmed animals and grazing cows. Meat is literally by far the main driver of deforestation.

Soooo we as a community of apes should find a way to short these companies responsible for that to death, while simultaneously boost companies that do research for lab grown meat.

THAT really would help our ape friends in the long run, trying to save their real forest instead of building one for them ü¶ç ü¶ç",Just an Idea how we could REALLY help our fellow apes in the jungle,1.0,1615712598,floschiflo1337

76,m4rufy,"So this sub is currently drowning in posts from people buying up the scarcest resource the planet has to offer: remaining wildlife.

 Seeing how close GambleShop is to lift off, what will our apes do with their extra cash? Buy even more wildlife. Once the availability goes down, the adoption prices will pump like crazy. This will leave the NGO marketmakers for adoption shares fat in the green but I would like to siphon some of that profit out of the compassion-market-space.
