It is common knowledge that he had surgery and failed to adhere to doctors recommendations afterwards which complicated and delayed his recovery. Uncle Jimmy, listen to your doctors please. So maybe it's just more of that but honestly I feel like they would have just said so.

Perheeps he is one of the unlucky few who comes down with the 'Vid even though he's been vaccinated. He seemed like he was ready to go back to his buck wild days of letting the melvin toots lick him in the mouth. I feel like it's obvious why they wouldn't come right out and put that on the news. 

OR perhaps.... It has become common knowledge among the hedgies that the GME squeeze is really gonna squooze. Maybe the steady climb in GME is due to institutional market making money slowly moving in to try to compensate for the impending incalculable losses they all know are coming. Maybe they think uncle Jimmy wouldn't be able to keep his trap shut about it. 

Anyway I don't know what I'm talking about and have done no real research. These are just feelings.

19,m1oa5d,"Like other feel good stories, I plan to help my dad. When this stock hits 100k and beyond (and maybe 1k for AMC) my boyfriend and I will have 1.1 mil after taxes. My dad has been working for his entire life and some. He’s a truck driver and only just recently bought his first house (I’m almost 30 and I’m buying my first house just a few months after he has). My dad has helped me through so much that I don’t know where I’d be without him. I plan on paying for his entire mortgage in full so he can actually save to retire and not because he has to work until he dies or officially goes deaf (he has hearing aids at age 54)

My youngest brother (who is turning 10) has autism and functions on a 4 year olds level. My dad has told me only once (but I know he thinks about it A LOT) that he believes my brother will always need someone to take care of him. Seeing that I’m about 20 years older than said brother, even after I’m gone, he’ll need someone to live with. I want to surprise my dad with a fund with 100k in it to start for my youngest brothers future living expenses that will grow with interest. That way my dad knows for a 100% fact my youngest brother will be well taken care of long after he’s gone and I’m gone. And if there’s still money left over upon his death, it will get donated to a children’s hospital. 

I’m thankful enough that I’m in a position now in life that this money will go towards other people besides myself and beyond. I also hope to starts a non-profit that will help veterans (since I am one myself) who are homeless get their own tiny home and help pay for vocational training so they can get back on their feet. I’m sure 700k left over will start this somewhere with a few vets but I’m hoping to slowly pick up the skills so I can build these homes (the right way) and only spend money on the material. 

Anyways, I know you all know how much this will change peoples lives. My dad won’t have to work to death once this spikes, my dad won’t have to worry about how my youngest brother will live once he (we) passes. And hopefully, some homeless vets won’t have to sleep outside within a few months :) all thanks to you apes 🦍 🦍 🚀 🚀 🌝 🌚  see you all on the moon, and thank you... for everything.","Like others, Here’s my feel good story...",1.0,1615346968,WookieMonsterTV

We know that GME can become a new twitch and Amazon for the gaming industry like chewy is for the pets. I can see a stock jumping overtime (with or without HF plays in). But AMC? New management? New ideas coming in? Are they working on something that we might know or not?

I would love them to start producing their own shows / movies. If an online book retailer (Amazon) can do that, AMC can certainly do that as well. Exclusive online or in theaters etc.

Not sure what else they can do, but they need to focus on improving their business and we will focus on getting them (us / we) rich in the way.
