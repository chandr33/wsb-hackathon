19,lxaa1g,"$**UWMC** Has been seeing a lot of inflow over the last few days. There are also a few elements that we need to consider.

**1. Inclusion into the Russell 1000 and 3000**

2. New product launch / relaunch

3. Current price

4. Current interest and large options buys

After going over some of the financial statements, earlier investor presentations I can clearly see why this is such an attractive buy. Robert Verdun recently made a purchase of common stock at $7.97 per share on March 1st 2021, which tells us that insiders currently think the stock is undervalued at its current valuation.

https://preview.redd.it/e31a7mx67xk61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1554e8b94f254884018685e65822110c87b48d35

From an earlier presentation we also established that UWMC, which is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 7.28 is undervalued in comparison to it‚Äôs peers. On that alone, we are bullish with a base target of $12, which is above the current price.

https://preview.redd.it/ex2qsud87xk61.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ff64cdeeab847fb1aa82d6fb9307d06e11945

Furthermore, UWMC has been seeing constant growth, which was further accelerated due to Covid-19 and the high housing demand.

Per the last statement, we can see that UWMC growth which was also highlighted in earlier presentations. A strengthening balance sheet with a large increase in closed loan volume.

https://preview.redd.it/yzqlk5ha7xk61.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9039e70958cc60a5e88ac9703623c2834a74dfc6

Also, UWMC

Todays price action in my opinion reflected people anxious to get out, that have been trapped for a while. After UWMC consolidates, I suspect we will see another move.

https://preview.redd.it/gnwkk2eb7xk61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62fb83c78ce613996f470bbffcfed1afb002fa9

Contracts traded at the ASK, indicates bullishness. Also, the Call / Put ratio indicates that UWMC is VERY BULLISH.

https://preview.redd.it/ccoh1gvb7xk61.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a93dab0577ad191902ace76ceb2d2ec50ef64a49

Big order flow:

Gamma indicates potential move to $9 on downside, and $15 on upside, very good Risk reward on the setup. The inclusion could tip this easily to the upside, so could any shorts covering.

https://preview.redd.it/x7snr0dd7xk61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6135037e027d48abbaf5d3f833433ad7925b2983

Shares available to borrow for short, was over 1million on 03/03. At the end of day, now sitting at under 100k shares available to short and a borrow fee that has increased.

So all of this to say, UWMC is a good buy right now, especially with the market trading sideways. I currently have a position from under $8 and will continue to add on daily dips. Consider adding if you are not in already. The run is just starting in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Other information, UWMC is more efficient than it's peers, including RKT.

21,lxaa38,"Hello fellow retards, heres a play for tomorrow, my favorite swing stock $OPEN reports earnings after market close tomorrow. Im bullish af because:
   
\-OPEN received a bunch of capital a quarter ago during the SPAC merger, tomorrow should reflect how did they spend it     

\-Zillow and Redfin reported good Earnings this quarter which leads me to believe the overall online housing market is bullish    

\-ARK has more than doubled their position on $OPEN in the last 20 days with ARKF being 2.88% in and ARKW being 2.44% in.  


The Pro's

Fundamentally, this company has the potential to disrupt the 1.6T U.S housing market due to a few reasons that Chamath and Cathie Wood have discussed before

1)People are moving away from major cities due to high costs   
2) 75 Million millennials, a lot who are digitally savvy, entering the housing market   
3)The federal reserve has told us that they are going to keep interest rates effectively at 0 for a very long time

The funny candle astrology looks solid too as it's right on support line and bound to bounce off like it did on February 5th.

[FinViz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN)

Their main competition? Zillow. Some people say REDFIN is too technically, but they're the smallest of the 3 market cap wise which leads me to believe they don't have the structure in place to exploit the incoming boom in the housing market. However Zillow is by far the biggest fish on this very large pond, on their Q4 earnings report released AH 02/10 they beat earnings expectations by 41%.HOWEVER I don't think Zillow is going to rule the market on their own, analysts actually expect both companies to triple in the long term according to this [article](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/071d6e52807747779fa175c7bbaf50e9.html).

The Cons:

1)Pre-SPAC it was known as IPOB, founded on 2014 by Eric Wu and other¬† names involved in the tech industry and their ROE/ROA hasn't been impressive since (their balance sheet needs work).

2) Its highly speculative. Zillow is better known and has twice OPENs market cap

3) They are not expected to become profitable in the short term. While their revenue has been steadily increasing, they have a balance sheet to fortify.

Tl:Dr

\-Tomorrow March 4th earnings report is critical for $OPEN

\-Chamath and Cathie are invested in

\-Possibility of disrupting the housing market

39,lxacrk,"  

The year is 2025. Manhattan is doomed. New York City is literally a wasteland where monkeys have developed a civil society and repurposed our old infrastructure into a massive banana farm. Employees working for the suits never leave their homes ‚Äì they work from home on their computers, order Uber Eats for every meal, ride their Pelotons to workout, and stream games from GameStop for entertainment. Office buildings have been literally crumbling after sitting unused for years.

Doesn‚Äôt sound very realistic, does it? 

The work-from-home trend is way overdone. While a handful of progressive tech companies have announced they will offer WFH flexibility post-COVID, almost all are still some sort of hybrid model. On top of that, I just don‚Äôt buy that people will want to stay cooped up in their houses after being stuck in them for 18+ months. People will be back in the office as soon as it is safe to do so. A) they want to, and B), corporations know that their workers are more productive in workplaces and not their basements where they watch CNBC and refresh Robinhood all day. Similarly, I don‚Äôt buy that people are leaving cities. While obviously there is going to be some degree of emigration out of cities during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC where your risk of contraction is at least somewhat directly linked to the population density of your area, people still want to live in cities. Cities are vibrant, oftentimes have the best jobs, and urbanization is a 200-year trend that will not stop because of some spiky virus. The localization and urbanization economies of scale are simply too strong for that to be the case.

So, you ask, lilpl, what the hell are you telling us all this for?

Enter SLG.

SL Green Realty Corp is the largest owner and operator of Class-A commercial office buildings in Manhattan. Before I explain any of the growth justifications, I just want to make it clear how big of a value play this is. SLG has raised its dividend for the last eight years straight, and currently has a dividend yield of 5.16% while exhibiting relatively low volatility with a beta of just 1.03 from March 2016 until just before the market crash of 2020. Yes, 5 as in five. In addition to this, the management team recently issued a special dividend of $1.7462, indicating that they believe the stock is severely undervalued.

SLG holds interests in 93 commercial and mixed-use properties diversified across Midtown, Downtown, and Midtown South NYC, and elsewhere encompassing over 40.6 million square feet. Today, Biden announced that the vaccine would be available to every American by May. $1.9t of stimulus is about to hit the economy. New York City‚Äôs tech sector is growing and accounted for 25% of all new Manhattan leasing ‚Äì this is not just finance anymore. Behemoths like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have been signing decade-long leases. Other tailwinds are too numerous to list here.

SLG‚Äôs stock was hammered after COVID, but it still has room to run. It was trading around $97 in February 2020, and dropped all the way down to $38 in May. Since October, people are catching on and the stock is on a tear. People are realizing that SLG can run all the way back up to $100 and beyond as NYC reopens. SLG beat earnings estimates by 169% in 2020. Its 5-year annualized growth rate is 13.1%, rare for a dividend REIT. Speaking of which, real estate is a great diversification play given the news in the bond markets. Don‚Äôt just take it from me. CFRA says that despite a high concentration in Manhattan (in my opinion, this will be a good thing when WFH is over), SLG has attractive NYC real estate holdings, a liquid balance sheet, and a manageable debt maturity schedule. 

This is WSB, so this is still a bet. But, would you ever bet against NYC, which rebounded after the 2008 Financial Crisis, which happened in their own city? After 9/11 shook the city to its core? Me neither. I am LONG SLG and do not plan to sell. This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.",Cities will return. WFH will end. This is my play.,0.39,1614824430,Lilpl1234
40,lxact2,"Hello!  

Meet $NCLH, or Norwegian Cruise Lines... the third largest cruise line in the world.    Boomers, families, kids all around will line up to jump back on these cruise ships as soon as the pandemicis over.   
 Pre-pandemic, this averaged at $60 a share.  As we're getting to the end of the pandemic, this is bound to bounce back up.  Steady gains in spite of S&amp;P falling steadily.   Up 46% in the last month.  6.25% today alone.  

2017 Revenue -  5,396,175 

2018 Revenue -  6,055,126 

2019 Revenue -  6,462,376 

2020 Revenue (during pandemic) -  1,279,908 

 *Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) is a diversified operator of leading global cruise lines spanning market segments from contemporary to luxury under the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceanic Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands.* 

Approximately 50% profitability during these years, only experiencing a loss in 2020.  

This is a long play towards recovery, but it doesn't look like these guys are going under.  

 **NCLH closed up 6.25 percent on Wednesday, March 3, 2021, on 1.76 times normal volume. The bulls were able to push the stock to a new 52-week high. Due to the stock's strong uptrend, it may remain overbought for a while. So, if you're looking for a reason to sell, don't put too much weight on it being overbought.** 

Bull Case - With Biden's commitment to having vaccines available for the entire population by the end of May, we could see large profits by the end of 2021.  I t entered the year with a record booked position and at higher pricing, as the global consumer was feeling good and willing to spend on travel.  Expect a large rebound in 2021.  

Bear Case - Global vaccination may take longer than expected, causing the stock to not rebound as quickly as anticipated, and affecting destination locations.   Due to debt brought on over the last year, additional business problems could cause business issues on the future 

Overall, I'm very optimistic on NCLH, especially seeing recent gains.  Let me know your thoughts!

#TL;DR:

I'm going to keep this short and sweet. There was no ""short"" squeeze. Nope, it never happened....(was a Gamma squeeze Tues and a long Gamma squeeze Wed). Read-on if you want another or want a real short squeeze.


#The long version:

What happened was a ""John Najarian"" induced GAMMA squeeze and is why it peaked in the $40's. On Tuesday, the highest options available were $36c. Mid-day JN made a comment about $37 options for 3/19. Call buying on RKT went nuts... As Delta increased at various strikes from retail buying, hedgies had to buy to hedge against the increasing delta, hedge+retail buying overpowered shorts until the hedges stopped once all the calls were ITM and no more hedging was needed. Then AH once options stopped trading, shorts and profit taking drove it down. 

Wednesday, same as Tues AH during pre-market, once it opened a ton of Puts were bought... Hedges could undo their long hedge then it all cascaded back to low orbit from the moon orbit(landing is $50+ in my book)
Note: Max pain jumped from $20 to $26.50 due to all the Puts that were bought.

#What next?

Well, shorts have two days to cover before paying the dividend next week(a small amount compared to the fees right now and interest around 60%...). Second, not only haven't they covered, but their position is up to ~49Mil shares as of the Tuesday close(45.15% short of float, based on S3 data through 03/02).

Do you want a short squeeze?(Max price in the $100+ range):

Only price action, aka retail buy and hold, will cause them to cover (How: buy shares without margin). Shorts are largely out of ammo and can only get more if your shares go on loan..(either opt out or just don't use margin with some brokers).

#Big Note: 
Due to today's loss shorts are under an SEC 201 Short Sale Restriction (SSR). Any short sale have to be priced higher than the current bid. They can slow upward movement(by keeping spreads tight), but can't push it down(can't kill the bid side). It will be in force until end of trading tomorrow. 

Can another gamma squeeze happen(open interest is still high)?

Yes, but this time it can go higher($75 range). This because the max option is at $64 now. How to force it? Buy slightly OTM options and roll deep ITM option to close to the money(use the credit for more options) to keep your gamma and tendies maximized.

Both together? You end up in the stars and shorts lose billions of üçå to ü¶ß... Or both sides hold until they squeeze and they pay long holders üçå until they cover.

Position: 

Cashed out half my position(10x gains, the rest is the shorts üçå). Currently holding 66 40c 02/05 down 90% on those and didn't sell(down $44k today). üíéüëê until it squeezes or rolling until it squeezes(gamma or short). 

RKT Position(YTD gains and today's loss porn):

(Posted both just so you can see I'm holding and that I already cashed gains yesterday, so it can't go tits up me). 

Edit: Max Pain this week is current $26.50 That's the max profit point for options sellers. Due to high OI at $30 expect heavy resistance there.

Edit: 

#Update for 03/05. 
Max pain is up to $27 now with the AH pushing it down to $26.29, we'll like see a bump to or slightly above $26.86(close). Tomorrow is the LAST day for shorts to cover without paying the dividend and the LAST day for longs to buy to get it. Highest open interest is $30 which means if we get above sustained buying above $30.23 and can push past $30.89 another gamma squeeze should start to kick in.

The bad news, hedges will do everything they can to prevent it. Why? Because this time higher strikes mean the squeeze can run much higher(Est $70+)... Which means bigger short losses(3x versus 2x last time) and likely margin calls of shares which can trigger a true short squeeze and push RKT to $100+ range (Hedges don't want a repeat after making money in Feb).  

Note: This means we'd need 12.5% from close 15% from AH close. If your going to buy shares, buy them in the last half hour before open to create more momentum going in to the open to attract non-social media retail and induce some gamma push as well. Resistance should be fairly low until $28.50+ (then things get tough).

&amp;#x200B;

Alright guys, as everyone has noticed, $RKT was victim to a **severe** P&amp;D over the last 48 hours. I have spent all day thinking about why this may have been the case; after all, it looked absolutely primed for a *juicy* short-squeeze and a big W for the apes in the midst of a stagnant war over $AMC and $GME. This was a planned event, backed by the HF's who seem to be gravely Short on $GME and $AMC. I am here to share my theory and how we can learn from today to further pressure HF's positions into squeezing our true guns: $AMC and $GME. I will first share a couple points that I think will adequately set up my theory.

1. **While HF's were caught with their pants down in January, they understand our tendencies and capabilities this time around.** 

The HF's are turning our own irratic, mob mentality approach against us. While we see this as a strength, we must understand that our nature can very easily be used **against** us; especially by those with vastly larger amounts of consolidated capital to work with. Our community is fast-moving and ready to YOLO a stock at any time, however, the HF's can move faster because of their vast resouces, their day-trading advantages, and their better understanding of our nature this time around. They are positioning themselves in spots to act in predatory methods and profit off of us.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. HF's have realized their one MAJOR advantage over us: Day Trading.** 

While we always get to see the real bagholders of the community dropping incredible, 6-figure amounts of money into stocks and calls, we must be real with ourselves and acknowledge that most of us apes **do not have at least $25k in our portfolios**. Why is that number important? Day Trading. I caught RKT on market-open 3/2 and saw my combined call and stock holdings soar from **$400 to $1300** by close. I wanted to sell and re-allocate those gains to AMC and GME before close but could not because **I did not have a day-trade available for me to use**. These HF's (someone correct me if I'm wrong) can day-trade all they want because of the value of their accounts. As for us? Not the case. They can act and react to the market at any time without penalty. This provides them with a major advantage over us currently, in terms of tickers that are not AMC or GME.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Theory:

* I believe that the HF's are trying to **scrape for any method possible** to avoid the MOASS from happening **entirely**. We all see the SI% and can realize that it is probably to high for the HF's to maintain paying those high-fees much longer. But what if there was a way for them to raise enough capital to not only offset those fees, but continue to short AMC and GME to drive the price down and outlast our will? **I think their answer was $RKT.** 
* $RKT had that special dividend news that was very exciting to all us apes and stirred up quite the commotion around this subreddit. **The HF's saw their chance.** They purchased Calls to help push the stock all the way up to what we saw it peak at yesterday, then sold those Calls to pocket their gains.
* HF's then turned around and **slapped those gains into Puts just before close,** hence the dip we saw just before close, during AH, and PM. This ties into my previous point I made about Day-Trades; while many of us would not have had the capability of doing that, **HF's had the capital to do so.** 
* Upon open this morning, the HF's further dumped into Short positions on RKT, **causing price dips, panic selling, and a downward snowball effect. The result? A double-dip for the HF's.** They multiplied their investment on the way up on 3/2 by simulating a potential squeeze, then further multiplied their investment by creating chain panic-selling today. 

**How does this tie into the main event: $AMC and $GME?**

I see many apes proclaiming that these types of ""Squeezes"" that have suddenly been popping up all over are distractions that have been orchestrated by HF's. I think that is true, but **it is much more serious than that**. Not only do these faux-squeezes serve as distractions to our main cause, but **they also serve as serious revenue streams for the HF's to survive**. The capital that they gained from todays $RKT P&amp;D **was likely used to not only pay off SI fees, but to also further short the stocks and drive them down**. Not only does it allow them to drive prices down, but it also helps them hurt our group morale as it pertains to AMC and GME.

**So, how how do we fix this newfound problem?**

We need to be very diligent about the scenario I just outlined. RKT looked as primed as ever for an epic Squeeze, but was #rekt within an hour today. Before you look to all these new ""Squeeze"" opprotunities, **remember what happened today with RKT** and apply critical thinking as to why this may have happened. I have outlined my theory, I'm sure others might have their own theories. Just please, be careful and remember why we are invested in AMC and GME: ***we like the stock***. If we continue to buy into these phony-squeezes, HF's can P&amp;D their way to enough capital to potentially kill our positions in the stocks we love.

# Some arbitrary statistics.

$RKT started off with a 10% daily gain on 2/26 while SPY dropped from $384-380 ($4)

TODAY $SKT went up 10% while SPY slid from $385.5 to $381.5 ($4)

Avg daily volume was 3m, [TODAY IT WAS 17 MILLION](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/)

&amp;#x200B;

COINCIDENCE, I THINK NOT.

# Quarterly Dividend of 4.33%

A quarterly dividend of 4.33% is in itself very healthy and suggests solid foundations in the balance sheet.

# BUT CHECK THIS OUT...

&amp;#x200B;

$RKT announced a $1.11 special dividend, leading to the glorious mooning.

$RKT traded at roughly $23-25 following the dividend announcement

GUESS WHAT. MATH SAYS $1.11/$24 IS $4.6%.

**STOCK TRADING SOMEWHAT NEAR $20. DIVIDEND OF ROUGHLY 4.5%. 10% GAIN WHILE $SPY DROPS $4. HMMMMMMMMMMM**

A BUNCH OF LINES ON A RECTANGLE. WTF DOES THIS EVEN MEAN?

**Here is an** **easy chart** for you dum-dums that can't read. I can't be bothered to scale the graph properly, just add a 1 in front of every number greater than 18 and then we have our actual targets. Here we have a neat little triangle pennant thing (play button for those who are high IQ enough to play beer pong) with a STRONG upward breakout followed by some standard consolidation. I expect similar movement in the following days until another, much more ""massive cock energy"" jump. Again, pay no mind to the stupid scaling. It'll be more like 18 -&gt; 40 -&gt; 80 -&gt; Valhalla (ask me anything about Norse mythology, I dare you).

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some more charts or something. Look at all these calls. IV is still relatively low compared to what it can get to.

&amp;#x200B;

[look at this shit](https://preview.redd.it/6wdahzh3axk61.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4133be6f543d2746fea506918802c9d5a99080e2)

Any option (call or put) can be a bagger here just based off the low IV alone. If IV reaches near GME/AMC/BB/SKT levels, they can triple in value regardless of direction.

Also as a note, Texas just opened up EVERYTHING. I live in Los Angeles where EVERYTHING is open ANYWAYS you just have to wear a mask unless you're eating, even if you're sitting 2 inches from some random person.

Shopping centers and malls are operating anyways and it can only go up from here for them. Biden said everyone's getting vaccinated by May (I just got mine today hehe). J&amp;J is getting approved, more vaccines are coming. IT LITERALLY CAN'T GO TITS UP.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Read the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwvvfn/skt_skt_why_tanger_outlets_has_the_most_potential/) and look at these graphs. $SKT will pimp out my girlfriend.
