15,mftj1t,"To my fellow Palantirians let me know what you think about farming losses. 

First and foremost, covered calls seem like a garbage premium for a stock you know can bounce and you‚Äôll basically have a ticket for takeoff but you presold it for a few percentages. Not worth it honestly. We all wish we were DFV and bought the bottom but you didn‚Äôt have to buy the bottom to make millions. Even he stomached losses for over a year. I love that man. Anyways... 

Some of us have some serious short term capital gains tax to pay next year. If you are classified as a trader (easily obtained if you simply set aside a few thousand and have fun day trading, you might make some, lose some but you will fall into a classification that will save you loads on taxes) you can write off all your losses. So what can we do? Well I‚Äôm holding PLTR and started buying at $34 (average cost is now $27.70) so what I want to run by y‚Äôall is the idea of using leverage and the wash rule. Because i believe in this stock i don‚Äôt want to get off. However, one thing i can do to lower my cost as well as offset my short term profits is to buy a ton of shares on margin and then wait 30 days and sell that same amount. Because of First in First out rule you can choose to realize a loss on the shares I bought at $34 but i never got off the rocket in the meantime. Since I‚Äôm in the highest tax bracket this year I‚Äôm having to pay near 40% tax so if i can use a dip to realize losses i will be saving $0.40 for every $1 profit i offset and then later get charged only a 20% tax when i sell at long term capital gains rates so i will truly be saving $0.20 on every dollar i write off as a loss. So now my Palantir dip can save me loads of money. If the stock tanks in the 30 day period for the wash rule, that margin could hurt me and I would need to make sure I‚Äôm clear of a margin call possibly by selling some early and if the Stock pops in that 30 day period, i make more money. I think the potential savings on my taxes will be very beneficial. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts? I wouldn‚Äôt want to sell and wait 30 days to repurchase that‚Äôs why i want to buy on margin wait 30 days and then sell my original shares i got at a higher price. 

I believe in PLTR long Term and i really would rather stomach losses than get off. This is a long term hood so the end goal would be to offset my short term capital gains but then hold the Palantir shares for well over a year which will then put me in the long term capital gains category. 

On a side note, i just joined Pappa Musk and will sell at a loss if it drops but then buy ARKK because they practically match TSLA charts so i can realize a loss but still enjoy the rebound. Feel free to comment on this as well.",Palantirians loss farming for tax,1.0,1617035799,hgr808

The King is back with another great DD. Check my track record on here, I'm undefeated and I plan to stay that way.

&amp;#x200B;

 Last week, we saw an idiot go tits up in true WSB fashion, affecting the PB's they did business with. This sent many, many stocks freefalling from ATH's in TMT stocks that they held, including VIAC, BIDU, DISCA, TME, IQ, etc. while pumping S&amp;P stocks because  the short positions Archegos held had to be bought back to close out their fund. Who was the idiot that led the charge? A boy named Bill Huang, a Tiger Cub and blatant price manipulator who was levered 5-6x to 1. **Countless success can turn a man arrogant and greedy, which is what I plan to capitalize on.**

 I'm here to argue the case that the PB's who liquidated Archegos' holdings, did so with disregard of the stocks' value in relation to price.

Before I begin to make my case, I ought to go over the near-term risks associated with opening positions in BIDU and VIAC or any of the stocks that Archegos held positions in, which is contagion risk. Because of the huge sell off in these names and the fact that MM's who invest in TMT tend to invest in all the same asset type, more margin calls can be triggered over the next 2-4 weeks before managers with loads of cash start loading up on these names. So my advice is to load up carefully, unlike Bill Huang, and you will be rich.

Now let's get to it then with **Catalysts and Fundamentals** for two of my favorite names Archegos was in: **BIDU AND VIAC**

&amp;#x200B;

Baidu (BIDU);

**Catalysts:**

 **Baidu's Apollo (Level 4 autonomy) and robotaxis**

\-Started its launch in Beijing and has received its first driverless testing permit in California and its 199th driverless permit in China.

\- Plans to begin mass production of Kunlun II AI chip later this year, which will be in direct competition with NVDA's chip for autonomous domination in the car market.

**Baidu plans to start an EV car company with cars rolling out in 2024.**

**56.2% ownership stake in IQiyi, China's Netflix**

  \-Currently valued at $7.7Billion

  \-At IQ's recent high of $30, stake would be worth $13 Billion

**Acquisition of YY Live for a measly $3.6Billion will leverage the company's bread and butter of advertising expertise once they acquire the social media app and other assets**

 **Baidu Core revenue for Q1 2021 will grow between 26% and 39% year over year.**

  \-Ad revenue is Baidu's cash flow generating machine which has allowed the company to venture into other areas as mentioned above. Their core business is returning to growth and FCF will be strong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals:**

21x trailing P/E or  $3.4billion in net income with $1.4 billion coming from the appreciation of their long term investments, or stakes in companies like IQIYI

2020 FCF of $2.9Billion

Forecasting 10-20% full year revenue growth as China returns quicker than the US due to low covid cases and the Chinese govt's bark will be larger than their bite as they will try to prop up their economy this year.

$5.5 billion in cash with a .74 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ViacomCBS (VIAC);

**Catalysts:**

**Streaming service release with an expectation of an initial boom.**

**Share price has been absolutely battered this month, falling 50% from ATH's**

**Domestic Streaming &amp; Digital Video Revenue Growth to 72% Year-Over-Year in Q4, Driven by Strong Streaming Subscription and Streaming Advertising Revenue** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals:**

11x trailing P/E or $2.6 billion in net income

FCF of $1.9 billion or 15x trailing 

$3 billion in cash with a 2.0 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is normal for a media company.

Compared to DIS multiples, VIAC is extremely cheap and you get a free buy-in for their streaming service.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Positions:

Baidu: 9/21 $230c, 1/22 $230c

ViacomCBS: 4/21 $50c, 1/22 $50c 

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason I am loading up here is because this is so reminiscent of what happened because of the mass defaults that occurred in the housing crisis we saw in the US in 07-09. The difference here is that the assets that were sold off were firm-specific to Archegos' holdings. Bill Huang may have been a cheater and extremely greedy, but due to the recent sell off at fire sale prices, I believe these two stocks that his family office held have tremendous upside. And as I said with my CRSR posting a few months ago, if you inverse me here, I will crush you.

Archegos never filed anything with the SEC and they have ties to blackrock. Blackrock sells a bunch of shares to put cash in the war chest. Then they throw a shell HF with no assets to the MSM so there is someone to blame. The amount of DISC, VIAC , etc that was sold can only be owned by Blackrock, Vanguard or sometimes Morgan Stanley. Then blackrock comes out today and says THEY GOT CASH FRIDAY. Also the stocks that plummeted were Citadel longs so shitadel just got pushed closer to margin call. Also RC &amp; Blackrock have been buddies for a while. DFV tweeted the rock remember? Archegos existed purely as a scapegoat. Citadel hurt Blackrock last year on Tesla. Blackrock is ready to fuck citadel back. They got money, just took out one of citadels legs and haven‚Äôt even started to squeeze.","Hear me out, Blackrock sold Friday not archegos",1.0,1617038218,Coltdub
