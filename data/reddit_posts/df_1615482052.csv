16,m2v0lu,"**TLDR: Bank of America is likely heavily involved with shorting GME through Merrill Lynch.** BoA/Merrill analyst Curtis Nagle has repeatedly and with suspicious timing stated negative sentiment with price targets to likely pressure the stock. If BoA were to be involved and a bailout be provided, this would stain politicians with going back to what happened during the financial crisis.

**Enemies, Old and New**

While much attention has been laid upon Melvin Capital and Shitron, there are indeed other players on the hedgy side that need to be highlighted. The reason why it is important to not have such a myopic view will allow us, the fellow ape degenerates, to understand how broad the tentacles of these evil wall street guys are. There have been numerous individuals and companies pushing against GME for a long time and given the events, not just yesterday, but even a few trading days ago make me believe it‚Äôs way bigger than Melvin and Citadel. How big you ask, Bank of America big!!!!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, how the ‚Äúf‚Äù is BoA involved with this? Well, we can look back to January 1st, 2009, when BoA acquired Merrill Lynch. Why did BoA acquire Merrill you ask?  Merrill Lynch was one of the worst actors in the global financial crisis. BoA was essentially there to salvage Merrill in what was likely a backdoor deal. If that had not happened, Merrillwould have gone the route of Bear Sterns. One fun thing to look into (sorry for the paywall with the Boston Herald) is the connection of Merrill working out a criminal deal with none other than William Glavin to only have a fine imposed upon them (source after paragraph).

**An Analyst Named Curtis Nagle**

So, now we understand the connection with BoA and Merrill, how is this relevant to GME? I will now introduce you to Curtis Nagle. He is the GME analyst from Merrill Lynch. Do we know what his price target is? Ole Curtis‚Äô price target has been $10 for the better part of a year. In fact, he was kind enough to reiterate that fact, well, moments before we saw a big short attack on February 26th. Around 11:45am, there was a coordinated analyst note from Curtis Nagle about reiterating the price target of $10 and then a huge short attack moments later. Additionally, we saw an influx of bots that came in with polling asking if we were putting more capital in, just holding or even selling. This was coordinated. BoA likely has more resources than any other bank and would easily be able to support this type of effort.

Oh yeah, when was the last time that Mr. Nagle put out an analyst note, on January 27th. Same price target.

**BoA as Financier for GME**

What could be some of the disdain between GME and BoA, well BoA has been the primary banker for GME for a very long time. I am seeing credit agreements dating as far back as 2014. BoA was also the main bank used for all share offerings in previous years. I‚Äôm guessing GME is not wanting to work with BoA when they finally decide to issue shares likely due to poor negotiated rates from BoA and not wanting to tip the GME hand when they do finally issue. You can dig into the GME/BoA/Merrill interconnected world via Edgar below.

Oh yeah, BoA/Merrill Lynch does not have any disclosed positions in GME. They probably have a position, they‚Äôre short. Too bad we can‚Äôt see it because the SEC and our useless government wants to focus on taxing the trade instead of pushing for more disclosure.

**Conspiracies To Indulge at Your Own Discretion**

While I put this part in, it isn‚Äôt to suggest I believe in them, but oh baby, they‚Äôre fun reading. It also helps to distract me from all the swings in the pricing üòä. 

\#1 Yellen may have played a role in the 2008 Fed negotiations with Merrill and BoA as she was on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors as the Fed Bank of San Fran. There may be underlying influences with how things panned out then and may pan out in the future.

\#2 John Thain, CEO of Merrill at the time of the financial crisis was a part of a the ‚ÄúTrilateral Commission‚Äù. The commission published a document, ‚ÄúThe Crisis of Democracy‚Äù, suggesting that democracy has swung too much in favor of the people and that more government control should be in place to help protect society better (paraphrasing of course). While this document was published long before John Thain‚Äôs membership, it gives an understanding into the thinking behind this. Also, a former Fed chair had been a member, queue Paul Volker

\#3 The Trilateral Commission looks to hold some of the widest breadth of industry leaders and power people. I don‚Äôt have time to dig into all the members to see where connections lie, but you‚Äôll be shocked at the breadth. One thing that I heard a few times in grad school was the importance of IQ as it relates to leadership success. Those with lower IQs simply need the higher IQs to help ensure their success and survival, ultimately understanding that the high IQs will need to make the important decisions. This list screams of elitism and ‚Äúknowing what‚Äôs best for us apes‚Äù.

**Next Steps**

What do we do with this information moving forward?  Understand this is likely huge if Merrill is doing the same thing with GME as it did with the subprime mortgage. Merrill is likely leveraging BoA capital to reduce leverage levels in order to maintain margin. I don‚Äôt know this with certainty, but that is my suspicion. Either way, I don‚Äôt trust anything from any analyst at this point. If Merrill breaks which puts significant pressure on BoA, then these cards will come down hard. It also means that BoA may be putting pressure on government officials that government support is needed to ensure the collapse of day-to-day banking. Think about how bad it would look for politicians if they had to once again bail out Merrill Lynch because they risked too much and were leveraged to the hilt.

43,m2v5j9," Hi all,

since I got some decent feedback on my first DD (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/) I wanted to thank you for that with posting a second one. This time it is commodity speculation. While lithium and graphite stocks already got their attention within the past weeks, cobalt was rather treated as the Plain Jane. I am going to show you why I think that cobalt prices and demand are currently about to rise drastically and why investments in companies like First Cobalt ($FCC) are a good vehicle to participate in that rise. 

**1)** **Demand in cobalt is rising almost 500% over the next decades due to Clean Energy transition**   
 **(e.g. e-mobility, battery storage)**

Several studies show that cobalt is, together with graphite and lithium, one of THE key minerals/metals required to successfully achieve the transition towards a clean energy society. The demand is (source: World Bank) is expected to rise by factor 5x until 2050, so almost doubling every decade over the next 30 years.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: World Bank](https://preview.redd.it/jxlkr98ojfm61.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20780a6b92c9ba2bf49db0a680b8684225509d)

But why is cobalt so essential? Well, the demand is mainly driven by lithium-ion batteries, as you can see in the following study, showing the end market usage of cobalt from 2006 to 2020f. Cobalt is a key ingredient within usual lithium-ion batteries. The cobalt in these batteries has a stabilizing effect on nickel or manganese and prevents cathode corrosion that can lead to a battery fire. So as long as lithium-ion batteries are still the battery standard, cobalt is a chemically essential compound. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: www.globalenergymetalls.com](https://preview.redd.it/otttrrnqjfm61.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e83ac12979fe35600e198f23c3ba256407288c)

**2)** **Cobalt prices have a history of cyclical price peaks and current developments indicate such a price peak ahead**

With 60% of cobalt world production is from Congo (former Zaire) and 20% from China, the supply chain security can at best be described as constant danger. Trade war with China, riots in Congo, or rising awareness regarding working conditions and child labor are a constant threat to reliable sourcing of cobalt. Ladder concerns (together with a negative price peak) for example, forced Glencore to close the world's biggest cobalt mining site Mutanga/Congo in 2019. These instabilities can always lead to exponential price peaks as you can see within the historical cobalt price chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: European Commission \(2020\) Raw Materials in the Battery Value Chain ](https://preview.redd.it/lqezqhywjfm61.png?width=1121&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=001e165cabb4e512ee64e19888c5090622b790d6)

Now you‚Äôre probably wondering: when will the next price peak happen? No one can answer this question with final security. But when you look at current price developments, **cobalt already increased 20,420 USD/MT (or 63.44%)** since the beginning of 2021, according to trading on a contract for difference (CFD) that tracks the benchmark market for this commodity, **now listing around 52.610 USD.** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: www.tradingeconomics.com](https://preview.redd.it/khym5g1zjfm61.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b60d5b5e19a2eceeb310e51d09a9b2d61a2c9b01)

But is this the end of this crazy price development? Probably not! The all-time high of 95.250 USD in March of 2018 still **shows a price potential of an additional 81%** without taking any demand forecasts for 2020+ into consideration. So, it might be possible that we can reach **new all-time highs above 100.000 USD.** But at this point, it is speculation! No one can tell you for sure how prices will develop. Why some predict falling prices towards 42.940 USD others see prices above 60.000 USD or even a new all-time high ahead. 

**3)** **To participate, invest in cobalt mining shares since no substitutes in form of cobalt ETFs or ETPs are available**

In contrast to other minerals like silver or gold, cobalt has no directly associated ETF or ETP (Exchange Traded Products). So how can you invest in cobalt then? Well, one possibility is using cobalt mining stocks as a substitute investment vehicle. When you screen the market for cobalt stocks you might read names like Vale, Glencore, or China Molybdenum. However, since cobalt only accounts for a minor percentage of their total mining output (e.g. 1% for Vale), their stock prices are not directly linked to cobalt market prices. Companies that are more suited as a substitute might be cobalt pure-players Clean TEQ Holdings, First Cobalt, or Sherritt International (at least 25% of its output). In the following, I will use **First Cobalt as a possible investment example**.

If you compare the stock price of First Cobalt with cobalt market prices you will see that there is an almost 100% correlation between those two chart developments. This historical comparison is no guarantee that the prices will develop in the same way in the future, but to me, it‚Äôs a good indicator. **So, if you apply cobalt prices to the stock price of First Cobalt, an all-time high price peak would lead to a target stock price of 1,15$/0,96‚Ç¨  (ATH of First Cobalt) - this is an increase of roughly 450% from currently 0,25$ct/0,21 ‚Ç¨ct!** 

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I see more strategic advantages with First Cobalt:

* Mining location in Canada offers supply chain security compared to China or Congo mining sites. In case some conflicts or trade wars might arise, this stock will directly profit from that development.
* The name ‚ÄúFirst Cobalt‚Äù will directly steer potential hype investors towards the stock as soon as prices will peak dramatically. So, you could say that their stock name is a good ‚Äúbrand‚Äù

**Risks:**

No good DD is complete without displaying the risks involved:

* **Substitute technologies:** Mainly due to mentioned supply chain threats and human rights violations, companies like Tesla trying to reduce their percentage of cobalt used in their batteries (currently 3%) or even try to build zero-cobalt batteries. However, several studies show that the stability-problem is not yet solved, resulting in a higher risk of overheating batteries, reducing their battery lifecycle. ([https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17488626/elon-musk-cobalt-electric-vehicle-battery-science](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17488626/elon-musk-cobalt-electric-vehicle-battery-science))
* **Company risks:** since there are no ETFs or ETPs for cobalt, substitute companies might develop in a negative way, especially when investing in an early-state mining tock like First Cobalt. But in the end, such a high-risk investment usually offers high return probabilities. 
* **Byproduct mining:** since cobalt is often a byproduct of nickel mining, cobalt demand might be covered by nickel miners. Based on the drastically rising demands of cobalt, I think that this scenario might not be realistic.
* **Closed-loop recycling:** battery producers try to reach a 100% battery recycling ratio. This might hamper the demand in the next decades, but as long as new batteries need to be manufactured and market demand can‚Äôt be satisfied by existing batteries, this should not be a problem for the case.
* **Price forecasts:** it might be the case that the cobalt price simply won't reach its all-time high or even a new record price in the future. So, this is where analysis ends, and speculation begins.

**Summary:**

In the end, I personally believe that a new price peak of cobalt might be ahead, and I invested a small stake in several cobalt mining shares since they are currently less overpriced than lithium or graphite stocks. If the speculation works out, no one knows, but as investor legend Andre Kostolany said: ‚ÄúAt the stock exchange, 2 times 2 is never 4, but 5 minus 1. You just gotta have the nerve to accept and endure the minus 1‚Äù Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like some of the stocks mentioned üòâ
