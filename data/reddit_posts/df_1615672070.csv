3,m4gcs0,"[Plus.ai](https://Plus.ai), &gt; $1bn valuation (likely more now w/ the interest in the sector) autonomous driverless truck  company, recently announced that it would equip its systems [w/ NVIDIA](https://www.thetrucker.com/trucking-news/equipment-tech/self-driving-truck-tech-developer-plus-to-launch-next-gen-system-for-heavy-duty-trucks).

Buried in the release - Apparently it also recently partnered with $BB for QNX **and** AWS. Some of you may have already seen this but this was news to me.

Saw a lot about partnerships from Blackberry with OEMs but one of the criticisms from the laymen is that its software has been around a while with old school manufacturers like GM / Ford (implying it's stale) - It says a lot that a cutting edge domestic autonomous driving business l[eads with $BB QNX](https://www.autofutures.tv/2020/11/17/plus-chooses-blackberry-to-power-its-automated-driving-system-for-heavy-duty-trucks/).

In addition - We all know electtric vehicles and autonomous driving is hot. But of all the applications, long-haul trucking, where routes are defined and largely over monotonous, consistent highway, are probably going to be the soonest to be completely disrupted.

TLDR - Man I love this stock. $BB to the mooooooooon!! But in a steady, safe, and responsible fashion, as Papa Chen would want.",New $BB Partnership - Heavy Truck Autonomous Driving,0.96,1615672260,growthinvestor123
