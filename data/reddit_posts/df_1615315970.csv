""The question is whether the market is correct in taking these risks.

The economy is still probably trending at or below zero (the numbers will get screwy YoY for a while) due to huge insolvencies and a still restricted global economy; and structural unemployment is 6-10% (*i.e.,* whether you include the Labor Force Participation rate or not) showing how bad the picture really is. Debts have been temporarily forgiven but not permanently, so those payments are yet to come, and a LOT of demand for durable goods and housing has been brought forward. There is a high chance of payback, and the economy can't survive without stimulus.

The risks are (1) the market trying to price in higher rates (but likely to be capped by the Fed or by more sluggish growth) and (2) a strong potential for the dollar to rise. Both causes upset the speculative reflation party. Or it can wither away if growth comes in weaker than expected. I err towards a rising dollar and weaker growth over time, once stimulus fades.

But, the question I am wrestling with is whether we are even using the right denominator for assets anymore. The massive money printing doesn't show up in CPI due to demographics, debt loads, deflation effects of technology, or globalisation; but it does show up in assets. I'm starting to play around with the idea that the right way to understand what is really going on is to change the denominator to the Fed balance sheet for US equities, or the G4 Central Bank Balance Sheets for global stocks. Since QE started in 2008, stocks have basically traded sideways (*i.e.*, they have offset the balance sheet but have done no more than that).

Only technology stocks have outperformed the balance sheet since 2008 and that suggests that the tech trend is a secular trend, which also makes sense to me.

In gold terms, equities are fairly priced versus the long run average too.

Thus, I'm starting to think we are looking at 2 bubbles: a shorter-term bubble in reflation (that can be corrected by a sharp sell off), and the really big bubble that is distorting everything—central bank balance sheets. When viewed through those two lenses, everything since 2008 makes more sense.""",Margin debt is highest on record. Hedge fund gross exposure is highest on record.

The argument against TIPS seems to be that the inflation they hedge against is already priced in. However, one thing that I believe is not being taken into account is the metric for inflation. TIPS calculates inflation based on the CPI-U. **The U in CPI-U stands for Urban**. This index is based on the price of goods and services in metropolitan areas. City centers have been disproportionately affected by Covid and this adds additional temporary deflationary pressures. The rest of the country also has Covid holding down inflation on goods and services, but to a lesser degree. 

I would argue that the current projected inflation for TIPS does not account for inflation on goods and services that has yet to come. As long Covid is keeping people inside, the massive amount of money we’ve just printed is being funneled into assets because it has nowhere else to go. Eventually it will make its way to goods and services, causing inflation much higher than is currently priced in. 

Am I missing something here? Do TIPS have other major drawbacks besides the “it’s priced in bro”?

TLDR: Covid has delayed inflation hitting goods and services, instead pumping into assets.

Here’s some art for you philistines. 

—————

The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have **THREE DIFFERENT NAMES**.
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
     All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
     But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,
     A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.
**But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
     And that is the name that you never will guess**;
The name that no human research can discover—
     But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
     The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
     Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
          His ineffable effable
          Effanineffable
**Deep and inscrutable singular name**

I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

The impacts on the global economy will be massive, as shorts are required to liquidate Trillions of dollars out of diversified portfolios, resulting in a massive crash of prices all across the stock market. They will have to lean into credit as well, drawing potentially hundreds of billions to trillions in loans from banks, private lenders, and corporate and individual investors.

For a few weeks, we could see the entire global stock market drop by over 80%, as literally trillions of dollars trade hands, moving from Hedge Funds, banks, credit lines and money lenders into the pockets of retail traders.

This is terrifying not only to Hedge Funds but to everyone as they begin to realize the implications.

Leading valuation companies like Apple, Amazon, Walmart, Tesla, Facebook, etc., could have their value cut in half overnight, smaller companies could go bankrupt, and the list of world billionaires could be changed entirely.

If this happens, not only will Gamestop become the world's highest-valued company, but anyone investing in the company could pocket millions, even billions of dollars. If this happens, we will be in a position to move this new wealth back into the companies that most deserve it, funding companies that have a vision and drive to make the world a better place, and fueling a new era of development on this planet.

The money that we earn could resolve the climate crisis, eradicate poverty and global hunger, advance medical science, introduce a UBI and equalize the global standard quality of life, retrofit cities, regenerate the environment and ensure a livable future for all life on Earth.

The impacts on the global economy will be massive, as shorts are required to liquidate Trillions of dollars out of diversified portfolios, resulting in a massive crash of prices all across the stock market. They will have to lean into credit as well, drawing potentially hundreds of billions to trillions in loans from banks, private lenders, and corporate and individual investors.

For a few weeks, we could see the entire global stock market drop by over 80%, as literally trillions of dollars trade hands, moving from Hedge Funds, banks, credit lines and money lenders into the pockets of retail traders.

This is terrifying not only to Hedge Funds but to everyone as they begin to realize the implications.

Leading valuation companies like Apple, Amazon, Walmart, Tesla, Facebook, etc., could have their value cut in half overnight, smaller companies could go bankrupt, and the list of world billionaires could be changed entirely.

If this happens, not only will Gamestop become the world's highest-valued company, but anyone investing in the company could pocket millions, even billions of dollars. If this happens, we will be in a position to move this new wealth back into the companies that most deserve it, funding companies that have a vision and drive to make the world a better place, and fueling a new era of development on this planet.

The money that we earn could resolve the climate crisis, eradicate poverty and global hunger, advance medical science, introduce a UBI and equalize the global standard quality of life, retrofit cities, regenerate the environment and ensure a livable future for all life on Earth.

Quoting Elon Musk, ""History loves irony, and the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.""

Please let me know if I am completely off my rocker. What do you think the impacts on the economy could be?
