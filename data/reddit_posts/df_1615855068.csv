12,m5wpye,"Ive been in GME since January and have been in it for long haul the whole time. Im not here to make some money, I’m here to get rich and to hurt the greedy bastards that have been caught with their hand in the cookie jar or go down swinging. No in between. If GME never hits 100k or 500k or a far reaches of space Ill hold GME till the day I die. 

But like a lot of you, I am sure, I’ve had my doubts. Not that were doing the right thing or if squeeze has been squooze (if you doubt that do your goddam DD). But what is a realistic number? What can I actually expect?

The honest answer is no one really knows. We can guess, estimate, hypothesize, but we wont know until its over. It is theoretically possible to reach any number if everyone holds when the time comes.

I don’t have a target, an exit strategy, or solid financial plans. But I’m damn sure not about to sell on the way up and pass on a once in a lifetime opportunity. Weather you have 1 share or 10000 you should want to get every last dirty cent from those corrupt bastards. 

I know I’m not alone in this sentiment. And if you feel this in any way you are not alone either. Fuck these pigs, fuck this broken system, and fuck those who want to keep us down.

As always this is not financial advice, I am a retard.

15,m5wqtj,"Hello fellow apes,

I’ve been on the GME ride since Jan and would like to point out something that’s missing this time around: there’s not enough ammo in call options to force Market Makers (MMs), the ones who sold you those calls, to hedge by buying shares.

As u/FutureYou1 has pointed out in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5tt50/gamestop_is_over/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf): there are too many apes YOLO-ing their money in $800 calls instead of something closer to ATM.

If you’re familiar with delta and gamma, you’ll know that the most hedging occurs as the strike price becomes ATM, and then it tapers out after that as delta doesn’t change as quickly once it’s ITM. 

If you’re interested in reading more into how a gamma squeeze works, check out this great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) by u/Natural_Profession_8: 

TLDR: the best way for us to put pressure on MMs is to buy $250 - $220 calls, which will cause them to hedge by buying roughly 48-59 shares, respectively, for each call contract. They will hedge more as those contracts become ATM since delta and gamma change when the stock price changes. 🚀🚀🚀

If you’re already holding, great, keep doing that. But if you have extra money, then please use it on calls that will HELP squeeze the HFs.💎✋",How to Trigger a Gamma Squeeze,0.91,1615855368,pinkcoco13

One of the issues in the code was the user looked at options being exercised as purchases done by executives. What we really care for is when Directors/CEO/CFO etc **purchase** shares using their own money. I have fixed the issue. Also I have parallelized the whole process where you can run the script on as many tickers as you like as it will be running parallely by default. For all the nerds there is a run time option to specify how many processes to run in parallel. You can look at the code on github:

I have added a few more fields to data previously created. Since it is the season of short interest I have added a field for the same. This data is being extracted from Yahoo finance. Some other fields like Market Cap, Avg Volume, Sector etc. And if you guys want to verify the information w.r.t insider buying or selling you can use the following websites:

Some of the tickers that stand out to me are:

1. POOL - The company's CEO bought shares 500 shares@316.03
2. W - One of the director bought 48000 shares@283.50
3. MSFT - One of the director bought 4300 shares@236.80
4. FSLY - Abidel Capital Management who are 10% owner in FSLY bought 500000 shares@65.41
5. LOW - One of the director bought 6250 shares@159.48
6. RPRX - One of the director bought 25700 shares@46.83

If you guys like this I can add more relevant data which can help in aiding DD then please do let me know. My positions: 200 shares in FSLY avg cost 72.17. 25 shares MSFT avg cost 213.54. Since I am an ***🦍*** I too hold GME 90@38.33. I will be taking a look at RPRX and W to see if I want to take a position in them.

Current analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value ""on the street."" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...

First let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...

&amp;#x200B;

\* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)

\* They are NOT a ""phone company.""

\* They are NOT, however, totally ""out of the phone business."" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.

&amp;#x200B;

This last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...

&amp;#x200B;

Though BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:

""As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.""

This last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so India... It's a country on the ""other side of the world,"" why should we care?

&amp;#x200B;

It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...

Though BB DID ""officially"" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name ""BlackBerry Mobile.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what does this have to do with the ""validity"" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:

A few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.

Looks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!

&amp;#x200B;

Enough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB ""liking the stock"") for a minute...

BlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...

In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!

Sheesh, I didn't know that!

Here's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:

""38,000+ patents

18 major development centers in 7 countries

I wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.

&amp;#x200B;

NINETY...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You gotta be %$%&amp;# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??

I'll let you ponder that point for a minute...

&amp;#x200B;

So, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home? 

But wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?

Well, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:

""which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.""

CARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...

Articles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...

Ha ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford’s current technology systems and touch screens.

So what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.

Two things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):

One, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership ""unique"" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.

Two, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since ""the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.""

So in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...

READ BETWEEN THE LINES....

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...

As of June 2020, ""its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today."" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)

What sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... ""Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry® QNX® software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.""

Shit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...

One thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their ""day in the sun."" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...

""BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.""

This is freakin' HUGE... ""BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees."" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)

&amp;#x200B;

March brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating ""BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery’s Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.""

to the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.

Add to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.

&amp;#x200B;

However, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...

All in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.

83,m5x5xv,"It has become apparent through recent events that the fate of Citadel and Melvin Capital are inextricably linked.  One might even say Melvin Capital is a thinly veiled shell company for Citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure.  

In the event of a catastrophic market event (GME mother of all short squeezes for example), Citadel and Melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions.  For Melvin Capital, this would start with Expedia, their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $1.5B in current market value.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly enough, Expedia is currently trading at all-time historical highs near $170/share, with a recent nasty pullback in January of this year to $120 range.  Expedia average daily volume is only \~3.5 million, and a share float of 113 million.  This means Melvin Capital's total EXPE long position is 10% of the entire EXPE public share float.

If Melvin Capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its Expedia holdings, the short term price of EXPE would capitulate downward, potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their EXPE exposure.  

I have nothing against Expedia, but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional de-levering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback.",Short Melvin and Citadel's Portfolio,1.0,1615856513,watchthegaps
