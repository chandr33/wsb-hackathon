19,m4btuq,"Back again with my colleagues derived SI, after it generated so much discussion last week (even ihor mentioned it) despite you fucks not being able to read. His replies to various feedback are below the data.

**Short Volume Today (Friday 12th): 5,793,090**

**SV%: 58.91%**

**His SI%$ range: 690.8% - 1038.8%**

**Daily Notes:** Oddly Slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed.  Extremely low Long volume, retail just holding. Off Market trades, bull instituations still carried us possible. Sizeable Shorts were place today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vjdi2gnf6um61.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63064c5be8ceb4ee478af9640913eb3e6026b800

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5kcbrseg6um61.png?width=1749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48ad514665ab0775845982c28274acadc558f64

**New notes for data:** It's getting to the point where Short Sellers would litterally need to be 80% of all off-market and long volume trades to be under 100%.

I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades.

**New Conclusions** We can conclude that the % of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 30.75% since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol' FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume  Therefore, it is not crazy to derive that ***SI% IS OVER 700%***, with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:** What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to. This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1j1f094h6um61.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb

**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.

*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....

*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.

*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...

*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*

&amp;#x200B;

**His Reposnse to feedback:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry

1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.

More importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)

I look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can‚Äôt use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don‚Äôt delete üì∑ I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\[14:02\]***\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me ""Fake News"" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the ""they cover instantly"" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, as in u/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.

All we really have is S3 &amp; FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...

Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10/10 on his new squeeze score aka the ""squeezeometer."" How this is derived  is ""a secret.""  So it's 10/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm

Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is &gt;100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.

I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume / float.

Interestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&amp;Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&amp;P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% ""in mid february"" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the ‚ÄúAmazon of South Korea‚Äù
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO‚Äôs a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don‚Äôt know anything.

üì∑

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP ‚Äúgross domestic product‚Äù (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: ‚ÄúHow did I ever live without Coupang?‚Äù

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. ‚ÄúPeople aren't the friendliest‚Äù ‚Äúyou're expected to work like a machine‚Äù ‚ÄúWork life balance can be hard‚Äù ‚Äúneeds more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and ‚ÄúBombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I‚Äôd name them but I don‚Äôt think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *‚ÄúWe are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.‚Äù*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *‚Äúpursue operational excellence and innovation‚Äù* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don‚Äôt think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *‚ÄúWe believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.‚Äù*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I‚Äôm going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I‚Äôve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should‚Äôve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole ‚Äústonks‚Äù thing. As you may have noticed I haven‚Äôt given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I‚Äôm waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don‚Äôt own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I‚Äôm buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

85,m4cclb,"First time poster, lifetime retard.  22 GME @ $175 b/e.

I've mulled over a couple of posts on gamma squeezes, option chains and the moon landing date of 19 March 2021, so thought I'd throw some of my own numbers around and check we're all staying extra retarded.

I've had a look at the call option chains for 12 March 21, 19 March 21 and 26 March 21 and have ignored absolutely everything else.  Ape logic.  My conclusion is that this week the markets will not close at the same price they opened.  ***Undeniable***.

At expiry, 12 March 21 in-the-money (""*ITM*"") call options totalled **33,485** (the sum of open interest at strikes below $264.50).  On the assumption these ITM options are all exercised, that's 3.35 million shares (6.2% of float \[*54.17m*\]) being bought at GME market price of $264.50 to fulfill the contracts, totalling **$885.7m**.  Ok.

If GME stays flat at $264.50 until expiry of the 19 March 21 calls, the number of ITM calls almost doubles to **59,338**.  Exercise would mean 5.93 million shares (11% of float) bought to fulfill, totalling **$1.57 BILLION**.  Nice.

The GME open interest falls drastically with 26 March 21 calls, with only **8,867** ITM calls at the same GME price of $264.50.  A relatively tiny 887k shares totalling **$234.5m**.  Boring.

In ape terms, the above means I think we're in for an exciting week.  If GME price stays flat and all calls expiring on 19 March 21 are exercised, call writers must buy 11% of the float to fulfill the contracts.  This is a substantial figure, especially when 100% of apes are not selling.  **Maths**.  Moreover, the more shares that are bought to fulfill the exercised calls, the greater the increase in price (my extensive knowledge of economics allows me to define this as ""*supply and demand*""), therefore more calls become ITM and the process is rinsed-and-repeated (the ""*Maya Jama squeeze*"").

**But wait, there's more...**

I've noted certain 'price points' on the option chain that would lead to call writers being required to buy more than 0.5% of float.  There's probably a fancy name for this but remember; I'm retarded.  I've indicated this by ""STRIKE PRICE (% OF FLOAT)"" below...

For the 12 March 21 calls, price points included **200** (0.8%), **250** (0.5%), **300** (1.7%), **350** (0.6%), **400** (1.1%), **500** (1.2%), **600** (0.5%) and **800** (6.7%).  The 1.7% at 300 could go some way to explaining the upward resistance we saw last week, as holding 300 would have meant a total of 9.6% of float ($1.4 billion) would have been needed to be bought to fulfill all ITM calls.  GME not holding above $300 saved call option writers a minimum of $230m.

However, for the 19 March 21 calls, there are more price points and at lower prices.  These include **39** (0.6%), **60** (0.5%), **95** (0.8%), **100** (0.8%), **150** (0.6%), **200** (0.5%), **300** (1.1%), **350** (0.8%), **400** (1.0%), **500** (1.7%), **600** (0.7%) and **800** (5.7%).  GME holding/surpassing these prices over the next week should lead to bananas for all.  GME holding the following prices by the end of next week would lead to the following shares being bought by call writers to fulfill ITM options.

**Price / Shares (% of float) / cost**  
$250 / 5.8m (10.8%) / $1.54b  
$300 / 6.8m (12.6%) / $1.80b  
$350 / 7.4m (13.8%) / $1.97b  
$400 / 8.2m (15.1%) / $2.17b  
$450 / 8.6m (15.9%) / $2.27b  
$500 / 9.6m (17.8%) / $2.55b

To conclude, I will be hodling.  Please note I am retarded and this is not financial advice.  Apes don't need advice.  I appreciate that solely analysing the call option chain is of very narrow scope with so many moving parts to consider, but I am too retarded to consider much more.  If any fellow ape has comments, improvements or corrections to make to the above then please do so.
