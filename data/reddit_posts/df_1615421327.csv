34,m2d4ei,"Dear Retards and Autists, 

Bear with me here (pun intend) as this will be my first WSB post.  After lurking on WSB for some time I thought I might try to contribute my theory of what the fuck happened to gme today...also note that I like to eat crayons and am in the process of lining up a tattoo artist to get my first one ever, I want a rocket ship and a ""gme go brrrrr"" (sick I know right) - also not my fault if you lose all your money, etc, etc. 

So, what the fuck happened today?  According to Finra, it wasn't a short attack, someone literary dumped a fuck ton of shares all at once (don't ask me how many because I can't count past 10).  Who you may ask is capable of such a thing, was it papa Cohen?  DFV? Another HF?  Fuck no!  Take a look at GME and AMC charts, do you see a pattern there?    Now ask yourself, if you were a whale looking to make some money, would you dump all your shares at once or would you sell chunks at a time to try and hold the price up as you exit stage left?  I think you know who it was already, a desperate HF playing one of their final cards in an attempt to try and save themselves...its obvious to me that they accumulated shares all morning and then dumped their position all at once to try and induce a panic sell, little did they know when retards panic, our default setting is to buy and hold which is exactly what you did today - good job! 

So what do we do now and what does the rest of the week look like for gme?  We'll as you know, when a hf shorts a stock they don't go full retard like we do, they like to manage risk by purchasing call options.  When these options are ITM (green) it creates a gamma squeeze when exercised.  The magic price for this week is $300, if we close above then its something like 1.6m shares that can be exercised - gme go brrrrr gamma squeeze.  This is another reason why we know shitadel pumped and dumped today, SSR in effect tomorrow is better for them than on Friday when options expire. 

03/19 is a big date, something about four things happening at once and the stars aligning, I'm too lazy to look it all up and repost it here, so do your own DD ok?  The one thing I will say is that the SEC is changing the rules, I think they call it the 801 bomb, there's a good video on YouTube, go watch it...basically there are something like 26 funds that can crash the market if they do stupid shit like short a stock +100% (sound familiar?), sec says if you want to be reckless then you need to post a bond that will cover you if you become insolvent.  What does that mean for us?  It means they have to put up a large chunk of cash that will be calculated daily if they want to keep on drawing this out, trust me they don't want to do that because it limits their options.   Some of you autists may recall seeing the price of amc close at 8.01 two Fridays ago, I say this was a message: the sec 801 bomb is coming - fuck you.  

Keep doing what you do best 💎🤲=🚀

TLDR (is that how you do it?) hedges bought up shares this morning driving the price up and dumped them all at once to try and induce a panic, nobody fell for it and this might all be over next week 03/19",GME WTF happened today and what to expect next,1.0,1615421646,Strict_Magician_2796

37,m2d4sh,"TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings. Positions at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, delivering you massive tendies going into their ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)). 

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&amp;J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.

https://preview.redd.it/vfsecceedam61.png?width=962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=577a34e60172a58d4bb5f2623afaa1fa4f158c69

* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better. 
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it. 

https://preview.redd.it/alnqw0ydcam61.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0869a63479bb1a95c804f407d0874c9090e23f0

* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping. 
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit. My positions are below, I gave it a bit more time to play out. 
* Positions june 300c and 320c

66,m2d90d,"Okay, so my wife and I bought as much as we could in GME, which was only 3 shares (and 20 AMC's). I bought 2, and she bought 1 at 161. Our discussion lately though has been: How do we know when to sell? I know we keep talking about going to the moon, and the stock going up to $1,000, etc. Which I believe. But our question is: how and when do we sell? Will there be a co-ordinated exit strategy on WSB? Or will each individual just sell when they are comfortable doing so?

For instance, if the latter is the plan, I can understand it. But what if, for instance, DFV and others with similar shares as him decides they've hit their number and they sell. Well that would cause a huge drop and one that assumedly would not recover, leaving a lot of people on the hook. Meaning someone would be left holding the bag. And if there's an exit strategy, and we plan a sell date, what's to stop the HF's from seeing that and just not buying when we all try to sell? Would that sudden increase of people trying to sell with no buyers cause a collapse in the price, essentially making the squeeze worthless? 

We are new and trying to learn this stuff. And we love the community here too! Today, with the stock driving so consistently and high over the past week, we put a super safety net on her stock of stop sell @176 just in case it all crashed or we missed the squeeze we wouldn't actually lose money. This was supposed to be an absolute fail safe for a doomsday scenario. But. It was triggered because these cheating MEffers decided to rig the BS up today and spike the price unfairly, which bounced back immediately, but caused her emergency stop to activate. She's really upset because she feels like she got cheated by these a-holes. And she did. The price didn't even register that low so she never had a chance to buy it back. She got screwed and I'm pissed. She's such a sweet woman and was excited to make a little extra to spend on herself and the kids (we are a cop and nanny, we don't have much). We know and knew there's always the risk of losing, so don't get me wrong. But the thing is, we (WSB included) were right about this whole thing. She should have been fine. But they cheated today. I want to take as much as my 2 stocks will allow me from these a-holes, but I also don't want to miss out because we just put in what extra we had. 

TL;DR- will there be a co-ordinated exit strategy for when to sell, and if not, and people just sell when they are happy with the number, won't some of us apes get left holding the bag if the majority sells?

84,m2db0e,"TLDR: 🦍🚀💰🚀🦍

I want to preface this by saying I’m not an experienced trader or anything other than a common ape.  This is not financial advice. 

There are a few things going for the stock this round that I think were not present in the late January ride and I think the overall situation has allowed several things to align with a once in a lifetime chance. 

Firstly, the stimulus checks. They’re coming.  Many people feel that $1400 is significant, but not life changing. People who can afford to will spend it on something fun.  What’s more fun than GameStonk?  If I lose it, so what. Never would have had it in the first place.  5-9 million investors all buying a few shares with a few free hundred dollars are less likely to dump it than a few investors in for millions.

Secondly, the history.  We’ve seen that a stock under the right circumstances can reach amazing highs in a short time.  History can repeat itself, and it looks like it is.  I laughed when someone told me that GameStop was going from $5 to $400. Then it happened. I stopped laughing and started taking notes. 

Thirdly, accessibility. The information that this can or is happening has never been able to spread so fast.  Compounded with the ability to invest quickly due to technology and new platforms.  I was able to download an app, and sign up and buy stock within minutes. Amazing. 

Fourthly, the culture. Not the retarded crayon eating cuck wife’s boyfriend watching culture. The culture of sticking it to big HFs, who have historically seemed untouchable. The culture which keeps people holding through enormous ups and downs on this stock.  An example has been set by a cat man with enormous diamond balls.  If he can ride 20million dollar swings with calmness then I can stay onboard too and see where this rocket lands.  Worst case scenario, I’m out money I never had.  Best case, I secure a better future for my family. 

Lastly, and most importantly, I like the stock.

Degenerates of all kinds,

I  apologize for paperhanding 11 GME stocks from a side account I didn't  want to close.  I have since bought back in at a considerable loss.  I  went from 11 @ \~$124 to a nice 8 @ $264 average.  Side note:  I still  hold 40 @ 150 in my primary account.

At  any rate, I also promised that if GME hit 400 (which I'm sure it will),  I would open a pickle business.  Since I work in the public, I don't  want to dox this account (so I'm not putting my name out there), but I  will have everyone know that I have registered my LLC with the state, I  have obtained my food production permit, I have secured a logo and  website for marketing, and I will be offering my pickles on the market  in CY 2021.  I'm also adding in virtual and in-person cooking classes  for anyone interested.  The GME gain gave me enough fodder to fucking do this.

It isn't  easy putting yourself out there to try something new, but the idea of  all of us going all in on GME gave me the push to try something new, to  follow my passion.  All of my profits are going to support local  charities.

Thanks for the wild ride so far.  Sorry for buckling for a moment, but I'm back in again, ready for MOON!

Here's my pickled jalapenos and garlic, about to made into a pineapple ginger salsa.  Great for banana dipping.

I won't yap on. TLDR at the bottom. 

As you may already know there was an article produced by @wmwitkowski for Market Watch about the 'GME Roller-coaster' that saw the price drop dramatically today. Please find below the proof that this article was not only RELEASED PRIOR TO THE DROP... But even written AT LEAST 14 hours beforehand. How long has this been scheduled??? 

Yes this little rat has sold his soul. But who is giving the orders? He went private on his twitter and deleted his posting of the article.

Its INSANE how disgustingly negligent they have been here. How can they play us like absolute fools, right before our eyes. With conclusive proof of a rigged media, it just makes me even more hellbent on winning this fight.

Hold strong you fucking apes. This only invigorates further outrage. 

Huge credit to @MrDavidNio for his detective work. I am just the ape hoping this message gets to you retards. 

TLDR: Market Watch has been exposed in producing news about the GME drop today. They released the article 14 hours before hand as shown through a Google search of the article. It was even published prior to the drop. Insane negligence.
