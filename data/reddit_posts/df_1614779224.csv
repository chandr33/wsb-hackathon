**Business Profile**

UWM Holdings Corporation engages in the residential mortgage lending business in the United States. The company originates mortgage loans through wholesale channel. It originates, processes, and underwrites primarily government-sponsored enterprises-conforming mortgage loans; and the Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Veteran Affairs mortgage loans, which are pooled and sold in the secondary market. The company was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan.

To start with, UWMC's EPS has gone down and is negative according to marketwatch, not sure how updated this is but it isnt a good thing to say the least:

* **-$0.09**

This isn't a good sign, but this won't matter if their is a squeeze. According to 4 analysts UWM Holdings is forecast to have 4.8% annual earnings growth and have 9.8% per year revenue growth which are both slower than the US Market's similar numbers. Meanwhile, UWMC's net profit margins are 59.7% which is higher than in 2020: 30%. Another good sign is UWMC earnings growth from this year: 545% which is higher than the Mortgage industry average of: 7%.

**Last Time It Did This It Just Tanked After???:** A lot of people think the that the price will dip the similar to what happened before on this stock, I believe while this is certainly possible, the difference this time is that UWMC introduced a dividend which the shorts will have to pay, making it more probable that the shorts will end up covering like they did for RKT (because of the dividend)
