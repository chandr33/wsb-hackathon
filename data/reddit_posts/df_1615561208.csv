Today we are seeing some follow through on that.  the 3 EMA on daily has risen above the 10 day and imho It has a nice stop out if things go south at the previous pivot of about 3.92.

Does the price simply reflect the amount that people in the US (or foreigners buying on US markets) want to pay for this particular emerging market ETF or does it also reflect the price changes in the underlying foreign stocks?

Assume that, overnight while the US markets are closed, the Chinese stock market goes down sharply and the Chinese stocks in the ETF go down as well. Assume further that we somehow lived in a reality where no one looking to buy emerging market ETFs were aware of this fact but the company that sells and runs the ETF was aware of it.

Would the price drop in the underlying Chinese stocks cause the ETF seller to make downward adjustments in the price that the ETF sells for? How exactly does this work? TIA.",Can someone explain how ETFs are priced?,1.0,1615561600,Rigel444

70,m3jjaa,"Our favorite short-selling, trash-talking, stock-dropping nerds at Hindenberg Research have delivered up another research report, this time focusing on Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). Interviews with former employees, partners, and others indicate that the vast majority of pre-orders (100,000) are 'largely fictitious', that several of the pre-orders were paid for by Lordstown in some sort of consultant pay-for-orders scheme, and that many of the pre-order don't even operate fleets nor have the finance resources to make the purchases (one example is a 1,000 truck $52.5M pre-order from a 2 person company out of a virtual office that called their pre-order a 'marketing relationship').

It's no surprise that a huck like this requires a huckster. Hindenberg documents a track record of waste, fraud, and chicanery from $RIDE CEO Steve Burns. Apparently Burns was forced out of Workhorse by the board due to wasting R&amp;D money and missing deadlines, being allowed to resign instead of being fired. Being described as a ""PT Barnum"" or ""conman"", multiple employees discussed them seeing considerable unethical business practices stem from his leadership. Apparently several of the technical decisions were made by Burns as well, including the decision to go with hub motors from a tiny Slovenian company because they were 'cheap'.

In response to Hindenberg dropping this report early this morning, $RIDE was down to $14 in pre-market trading from $17.72 at close yesterday.  They opened at $14 to a huge \~6M selloff, and have slightly regained footing at $14.62.

//I’ve been there in the good and bad you see
//It all started a few months ago
//When the hedgies did a bit too much blow

GameStock, they said was going to plummet.
//It’s dieing retail, it’ll never reach the summit 
//But little did they know there was not a cat in town
//Who noticed the antics of these hedgie clowns

Buy the dip he said from $4 to $2
//It was dismal it seemed, the buying was through
//But then all of a sudden, Ryan Cohen hopped aboard
//He bought into the stock, this could not be ignored!

People realized the value of this great stonk
//The price skyrocketed, the hedge funds in shock
//But then the hedgies thought we cannot let this be
//Retail traders, beating us? We’re losing our money tree.

So the hedgies decided they would take a stand.
//Against “dumb money” (that’s us) and the WSB brand.
//They gave millions to officials news outlets and more
//To spread the story that GME would make everyone poor

Their FUD wasn’t working billions down the drain
//They decided to restrict trading to stop the retail gain
//No more shares could be bought, you could only sell
//The problem is, we didn’t hear no bell

As the stock dropped to $40, I sank to my knees
//The market was rigged and I didn’t have the keys
//They change the rules when they want
//As the ultra rich twitter warriors, gloat and taunt

The paper hands started screaming, we told you so!
//In disbelief I saw the number -90% and below.
//But then I realized a small and true fact
//That I could actually survive these attacks

It wasn’t a loss until I actually sold
//So I did something others, might have called bold.
//I doubled down on my shares and lowered my cost
//As the price continued to decrease all seemed to be lost

Then a glimmer of light started to shine through.
//The headbanded investor bought more for me and for you.
//This catalyst was all that the stock seemed to need
//As the price rose, and hedgies again started to bleed.

The price hit almost $400 and dropped like a rock
//$198 the chart said, the chat screaming what the fock
//The price jumped back up quick and went back to even
//I doubled my resolve, this is a stock to believe in

And now we have made it to today
//What side are you on and with what do you play 
//Make a choice, hold or buy if you can
//Just make sure you are going in with your own plan.

GameStonk to the moon, yet again it seems
//It can stay a great rocket, just through all the great memes
//To the moon we may go, keep us In your prayers
//At the end of the day, power to all the players
