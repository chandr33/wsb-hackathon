It is time to use some of our hedgefund destroying power for an even greater good - to help our helpless paper handed friends (and I am not talking about your wives boyfriend).

We are able to throw our shit while standing on the shoulders of giants. AKA none of this would be possible without those that have come before us. While we continue to honor them using their time tested traditions of slinging stinky shit at the Andrew Lefts and citrons of the world, we must do more. 

It is now time for us to put our rocket gains and loss porn to another use - helping the original shit slinging legends. 

If you have a few dollars left and willing to YOLO on a sure thing, this is it. 

Plus, every month you get a letter written from your adopted gorilla on a banana leaf in fresh poop that can be sent right to the short seller of your choice.

OTIS (famous for their elevators) was originally apart of United Technologies -- now Raytheon (RTXz). RTXz 401ks (which handles investing several billion $$$) announced that they will be removing Carrier (CARR) and OTISz stocks from their 401k plans during the 1st two weeks of April. RTXz asked employees to manually move any holdings out of OTISz/CARRz investments in their 401k to any of the other ETF/funds offered by the company's 401k plan before April. Otherwise RTXz will transfer those funds from OTIS/CARR investments to other funds in the 401k automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Why OTISz instead of CARRz? Carrier was relatively low at the time while OTISz is currently at its all time high. Otherwise I think they may both move similarly but I decided to go after OTISz instead.

44,m74ee3,"Hi,

Gonna keep this pretty simple.

EXPE is waaaHAAAAYY overextended right now. We all know essentially what expedia does. It helps connects buyers and sellers of vacation assets.

Its at ATH. about 43% higher than the pre March market dump. Not going to get into the fundamentals as to why its so much higher because it doesnt fucking matter. This hoe needs to see a reversion to the mean. Just look at the daily/weekly/monthly chart. Take a peak at the RSI (9 day or 20 day). Sprinkle in a look at some bollinger bands. You will see how stupidly overextended this stock is. Lastly, just understand the industry its in. the travel industry. 

WHY THE FUCK would expedia be at all time highs right now? Ya, sure, vaccines are rolling out and its all looking nice moving forward. But this hoe has seen one of, if not the worst, yearly performance on record.

Anyways. Its PUT time. Price Target is $150 within a month. Im looking for an entry point on 160 puts with a 4/16 expiry. You can go out longer if you want to dish out the additional capital. Im more than willing to roll my 4/16 puts if we dont see the drop that im expecting by that time.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: EXPE over extended AF. Needs to have a reversion to the mean. Its ATH after having a shit year in the travel industry. 160 P 4/16 EXP. Can go out longer if you want to pay a higher upfront cost. Price target $150 \~500% return.",EXPE 160 P 4/16 or longer,1.0,1615998788,JustJakeYoutube

Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.

 **$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**

We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.  


[$AMC](https://preview.redd.it/8cxvnms99mn61.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b117cb869ad073ba1fdb3cc922b70461959c46d3)

**$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**  
You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!

&amp;#x200B;

**$RKT covering only started TODAY!**

RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed.... I see a BIG OPPORTUNITY....

**$NOK absolutely no short covering or anything notable! This stock is SO BORING but I LOVE IT!**

**TLDR:**  
**$AMC: This week a lot of short covering driving price UP. More to come! Looks good.**  
**$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**  
**$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**  
**$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**   
**$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**  


We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!",SHORT COVERING 3/17 - $GME $AMC $RKT $BB $NOK,1.0,1615999599,bosshax
