If you're a dumbass and didn't read the title, please know that this post will be about $UWMC and why it's about to go to mars.  


**INFO**   
UWMC stands for United Wholesale Mortgage Corporation. They are a mortgage company similar to RKT. They fund mortgage loans through mortgage brokers and they take the interest. Many of you zoomers in college know interest very well. So do I.  

At the moment of posting this stock is at about $8.40. It has a Market Cap of about 13 billion and is incredibly volatile at a volume of  11.68 million. It has an insane dividend of 4%. Still don't like the stock? Scroll down.   


I will add an excerpt from another post. Credits will be below.   


 UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do I hate? The shorts!

You say

The price of my stocks not a price that you’re willing to pay 

You cry

DFV’s brought some info we see that’ll make the stock fly

Why so sad 

Remember you made an arrangement in 2008 

Now we’re making you mad 

Remember, despite your arrangement made with Vlad 

&amp;#x200B;

You’ll be broke, soon you’ll see 

It wasn’t smart to go short GME 

You’ll be broke, time will tell 

Till the moon, this stock we’ll never sell 

Meme stocks rise, Hedgefunds fall 

Apes have seen eachother through it all 

And when push comes to shove 

We will send the meme stock up so high that it can never ever fall 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You say your funds are draining and you can’t go on

We’ll take our stock to the moon before we’re gone 

And you’ll be charged short interest 

Every day more short interest 

A steep, hill of short interest

That piling, climbing interest 

Forever, and ever, and ever and ever and ever...

&amp;#x200B;

You’ll be broke like before 

We will hold despite the stocks you short 

For our funds, for our apes, 

Even if I take it to my grave 

When it’s done, you’ll go mad

So don’t try to short out stock again

Cause when push, comes to shove 

We drain Melvin and citadel, to prove its a stock we love

All professional poker plays know you cannot bluff a fish. You bluff to make your oponent fold weak hands. But this assumes that your oponent, knows that they are holding a weak hand. You cannot bluff someone who does not know the strength of their own hand!

I've been a degenrate poker player for years, but I have never bought a stock before GME. In the world of stocks I am the biggest fish there is, a retarded whale with a flipper full of GME. Bought at 300, ridden the whole way down to 40, and still holding. I havent got a fucking clue what it's worth.

42,m1c9z0,"So we've been steadily rising for days now, with barely a dip and I think I know why. No more shorting. 
Back in January the stock regularly plummeted, only to violently bounce back and it was scary as hell. Now we're just steadily rising, seemingly no end in sight. I think the hedgies are too scared to short it, which was their defense strategy last time. I believe that's what people were referring to with the whole ""short ladder attack"" thing. They borrow a whole bunch of shares to short, and when they sell them in large quantities, at the right moment, it causes large drops in the stocks price. This time is different. 
We're all prepared to ride this into the sunset, (others are willing to ride it all the way to the tippy top, and all the way back down to the ground), and we all know the power that we possess by holding. I bet they're just sitting back, too scared to short and end up being fucked even harder than they are about to be, and hoping for the best. Only problem for them is that there's no telling how far this could go. 
How many days of extremely low volume, yet drastic price increases are we going to go before something happens? What if no shares become available and no trades are happening at all? What if we peak at $69,690.69 and nobody is willing to sell because it's just so beautiful to leave the price right there!?
