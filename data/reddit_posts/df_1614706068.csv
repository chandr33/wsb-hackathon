The excel template shows you how much additional stonks evil MMs need to buy or sell to remain delta neutral if on the same day $GME price rise/fall to  XXX from its current level. You need to enable macro for it to run, don't worry it doesn't have any nasty virii in it.

Now, a MM is not actually legally obliged to be delta neutral (if ur counterparty is wsb theta gang, they don't delta hedge) However most of them try to be, and the standard BSM model used in this excel template is not what they use in the industry, but the results shouldn't be too far off.

The template contains options OI up until the 3/19 expiry

Overview:

Revenue increased by 118% to $24.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 166% to $83.3 million for the year ended October 31, 2020. Note that the quarter does not include any contribution from META Growth Corp., the acquisition of which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter.

Gross profit increased by 112% to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 172% to $30.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2020.

Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 35%(*) and 37% for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the fourth quarter was $3.6 million and $8.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2020.

Geographically in the fourth quarter of 2020, $20.6 million of revenue was earned in Canada, $4.1 million in the United States and $0.2 million internationally. For the year ended October 31, 2020, $68.4 million of revenue was earned in Canada, $14.3 million in the United States and $0.6 million internationally.

Segment-wise in the fourth quarter of 2020, $22.6 million of revenue was generated by Retail, $2.2 million by Wholesale, and an immaterial amount by Corporate. For the year ended October 31, 2020, $75.0 million of revenue was generated by Retail, $7.9 million by Wholesale and $0.4 million by Corporate, which compares to $24 million, $6.69 million, and $0.6 million, respectively, for the previous year.

Cash on hand as at October 31, 2020 totaled $7.5 million. The Company's cash balance has subsequently increased to approximately $38 million as of today.

I'm bullish on this company. They are looking at getting into the US and have filed for NASDAQ listing back in December.

[https://www.spacweekly.com/ajax\_i](https://www.spacweekly.com/ajax_i)

The above link is an overview of the AJAX I team.  Before I continue remember this is not trading advice as I am merely a mythological creature with massive diamond balls.  This is an overview of the AJAX I members.  There is plenty of good but also plenty of bad press to be explained of the members in this post.  Please refer to this as a job interview Google search of the members.

&amp;#x200B;

Head of AJAX I Dan Och.  Let me begin with the bad first.  Dan's previous capital firm had to ultimately change its name to Willoughby Capital after an incident in 2016 bribing African officials across several African countries for the mineral rights.  The fine was 412 million, violated SEC Law, had his attorney Michael Cohen involved with different political scandals ultimately with President Trump.  Dan Och says that this entire law breaking event was not representative of the values of himself or the firm; however, it was reported Dan had to sign off on the incident personally for approval in the firm.  

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/09/29/billionaire-dan-och-sanctioned-hedge-fund-firm-to-pay-412-million-to-resolve-bribery-charges/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/09/29/billionaire-dan-och-sanctioned-hedge-fund-firm-to-pay-412-million-to-resolve-bribery-charges/amp/)

Dan Och's good findings from a simple Google search would be his intricate background in mergers and acquisitions.  He had high level management experience in Goldman Sachs during their prime years, some would argue still in their prime.  He has continued the past decade of his life managing Willoughby Capital and doing plenty of charitable deeds.  Dan Och and his wife sponsor a hospital, contribute to their alumni, and besides this African mineral rights bribing incident are very much only benefitting the community around them.  Dan Och being a billionaire for nearly 2 decades I would assume has created a vast network of capital investors, managing members, and overall scope for obtaining successful companies.  Dan Och is the epitome of capital investment firm head- experience in this field second to none.   

Second in command Glenn Fuhrman.  Let us start with the good.  Glenn is a family man with a ton of experience in acquisitions and mergers.  Fuhrman like Och got his start at Goldman Sachs then moved to other capital firms.  Glenn is the main money man behind the Michael Dell purse, managing a giant fund and creating impressive returns.  

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-dells-money-managers-change-how-his-wealth-is-invested-11575628204](https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-dells-money-managers-change-how-his-wealth-is-invested-11575628204)

Continuing with Fuhrman's pros - a quote from a Forbes article in 2011 says, ""You pick the A team and they will get the A+ team players below them.""  I believe that's what we are seeing with this team when we look at Dan Och, Steve Ells, James McKelvey, Kevin Systrom, and Anne Wojciki.  

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2011/12/14/the-best-advice-ive-ever-received-about-hiring-talent/?sh=51048b65666c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2011/12/14/the-best-advice-ive-ever-received-about-hiring-talent/?sh=51048b65666c)

Unfortunately, nobody gets a free lunch, here are the Cons for Glenn Fuhrman.  The Wall Street Journal post that explains how well Michael Dell's money was managed by Glenn also includes a sentence that says Mr. Fuhrman is taking a step back from the Wall Street life to spend time with his three children- not exactly what I want to hear about an SPAC I'm dumping my life savings into.  Continuing, Mr. Fuhrman created Virt capital and launched the public company VIRT.  Looking quickly at VIRT- the returns since its IPO has remained very flat over the past 5 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*Strategic advisors of AJAX I\*\*\*\*

Steve Ells, I love this guy.  I listened to an entire podcast ""How I Built This.""  Steve is a visionary and good hearted man.  He created Chipotle that has been the best growth stock for a food company of all time in my opinion and one of the best growth safe stocks of the past dozen years.  Ells was founder and CEO of Chipotle for over a decade.  Nobody gets a free Chipotle bowl in this post though.  Steve was also running the ship on the unfortunate E. coli and queso implementation.  The overall market conditions of the time in 2015 when this all happened would leave nobody to question Steve's vision, work ethic and decisions.  Steve ultimately was forced out of Chipotle but left trying to make good returns on his customers, shareholders, and the world.  I also remember reading somewhere that he wanted to create better ingredients in Chipotle for a small price increase but the board went against him.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/30/why-chipotle-ceo-ells-had-to-go.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/30/why-chipotle-ceo-ells-had-to-go.aspx)

James Morgan McKelvey, Jr.

There is literally no bad press on this guy.  Love Mr. McKelvey- he is an artist, philanthropist and visionary.  Square Co-Founder McKelvey has only good press.  James would return back to his home state to give opportunities of employment and investments after the success of Square.  Every where you Google this man's name you will find good-hearted, hard working, inspiring stories.  I would trust this guy with my first born!  Great press and one of the best assets of AJAX I for me buying this stock with my life savings.  

Kevin Systrom

I will be quick to tell you that this man is a hero.  This man is GOATed to the bone.  Kevin Systrom sold Instagram to the cyborg that is Mark Zuckerberg for 1 billion dollars.  A quick Google search you would find that Kevin does not care about money as much as he values integrity, hard work, and community.  As recent as 2018 he had to leave Instagram as CEO because of the pressure Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook was putting on Systrom in regards to location tracking etc.  There is nothing bad I could find about this man other than he gave the big middle finger to Mark Zuckerberg for spying on the American people right before the Cambridge Analytica scandal - documentary is on Netflix.  I would play corn hole, grill sausages and ride this big rocket straight to the moon with this guy.  All hail Systrom and this team of strategic advisors.

Anne Wojcicki

Anne is a 50/50 for me out of the list of strategic advisors.  Let us start with the good.  Anne started 23 and Me - this is the only company with 6 FDA clearances, for that, she is GOATed.  Wojcicki is also one of the most successful self-made female entrepreneurs of all time.  Let us move on to the bad now.  January 2020 Wojcicki laid off 14% of their employees for decreased sales going into the new fiscal year (100 employees were fired).  Not the best outlook when your company is laying off people before the pandemic. Second and last bad thing is she is a political commentator in the business field.  She states, ""There should be one female for every male in every company.""  A little too political for me in the business sphere.

\*\*\*\*Investment Team\*\*\*\*

J. Morgan Rutman

Rutman is President of Willoughby Capital - Dan Och's firm.  J. Morgan has had a detailed investment experience but what concerns me is the fact that he is paid 200k a year?  If I am betting my life savings on a SPAC would I want one of the managing investors to be paid so little as to have so much to gain for themselves.  Maybe somebody else could find more but logically low pay = red flag.

Mira Muhtadie

Mira is Chief Investment Officer of Willoughby Capital.  Muhtadie has a detailed background in acquisitions and mergers.  Unfortunately for Mira I could only find that she worked her way high up in ACI Capital.  ACI Capital was not a success and was found to charge too high of premium for negative return on investment leading to the dissolution of the firm.

Adnan Ahmad

Ahmad is a Managing Director at Willoughby Capital.  Adnan Ahmad has jumped between several jobs since 2008.  It seems every 2 years he has a different job- not the best look for me as an investor dumping my life savings.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*Conclusion\*\*\*\* tl;dr

Yes I still have my life savings dumped into this company.  You are buying a lotto ticket for Willoughby Capital and its team of advisors to merge and launch a winner through AJAX I stock.  I believe it is best to be truthful even through the bad news.  This post was intended to give a larger scope than a quick AJAX I Google search or Youtube video search.  

I believe that this team is more good than bad ultimately.  I also believe that this team has the experience and needs to prove themselves - what better way to prove yourselves than a rocket straight to the moon with a good company IPO.  Please Dan, Glenn, Steve, Kevin, Anne, J. Morgan, Mira, and Adnan - guide us to the moon to tendie land.

I sadly don't have a ton of money to be playing with but I did buy into GME and AMC at ummm an unfavorable price haha but holding onto those puppies like my wifes boyfriend holds her when I leave 🙏.

Either way! I was doing so fat sleuthing and ran across the stock - $ET, it reminds me of that little alien and while you all are posting rockets ships I want to be posting UFOs 🚀👉🛸🛸🛸🛸

This thing has a rating of strong buy across most large rating systems, currently sits at around 8 bucks a pop but has an outlook of 18! Obviously this thing isn't going to make you millions overnight (Unless you're putting in millions) but it will at least be a decent cash cow... Ahhh, Cows get abducted by UFOs I see what I did there.

But here are some stats for you apes
- Projected outlook 18.00 compared to its current 8.04 at time of writing
- Pays quarterly dividends of 0.15 per share at a 7.98% yield rate
- 5 star rated across multiple platforms
- Strong buy from multiple platforms
- Currently acquiring $ENBL to increase their foothold in pipelines and lower debt
- Assets worth 95 Billion
- Debt totals 51 Billion (All long term)
- Owns : Tufco, HPL, Transwestern Pipe, LDH Energy, Southern Union, PennTex, SemGroup, Regency, Susser and Sunoco
- Biggest Customers are : American Electric Power, Center Point, Spire, Entergy, OGE, XTO, Marathon Oil, Cheasapeake, Tapstone and BP
- Currently Gather, Transport and Export their own Natural Gases
- Is set to be biggest powerhouse for Mid Southern US

So take that as you will but I seriously think tendie man is going to be paying me a visit this season.

Just wanted to try and be helpful, you guys have been amazing and so entertaining, I seriously wish I could take you all out to the amazon and peel some bananas together. Love you guys!

A few point before viewing the Data:   
1) RKT is superior to GME.

2) I expect RKT to become the king slayer of all other meme stocks (Including GME)

3) Hopefully when RKT kills GME, this sub will be saved from the swarms of mindless dumbdumbs that spam it all day every day.

**Catalyst events: 1.11 Dividend on 03/08 (causing shorts to cover by 03/05 or pay the dividend), great profits, 103% institutional ownership, 40% SI.**

Update for 03/02/21: My estimation is PT up to $40 for full squeeze (given that the OTM options top strike is $36).  There was some covering this morning causing the upward push, and I think would have been pushed more but met resistance at $30 and shorts keeping it low.

**This is the same setup as yesterday.  Price may move horizontally for the day or have a mild upward tick and then likely increase significantly AH causing more gamma squeeze tomorrow morning.**

Buying this stock/option is riskier than yesterday, but still good upside.  Consider call debit spreads to lower your cost bases (e.g. 28/36).
