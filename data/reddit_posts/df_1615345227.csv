6,m1nqmw,"Gentlemen, we all know GME is back on the menu. But in order to squeeze this thing for all it’s worth, we need to take our communication between us degenerates to the next level.

That’s right, we are taking this to the next level. We are starting up a good old fashion phone chain!

When it hits $1,000, DFV will be texting me and two other people on whether to buy more or sell. When I get the text him , I’ll text the next three people that comment to this post. Those three people will text the next three people, so on and so forth. 

Shouldn’t take long before all 9 million of us degenerates get the message.

This is the official sign up sheet. Remember, if you don’t hear anything from us, that is the signal to KEEP BUYING

7,m1nqq8,"Theoretically, as more people buy HOGE Coin/Financial, “1% of that transaction is removed or ‘burned’ from the total supply” from every transaction. Hoge currently has a supply of 1 trillion coins with over 400 billion in circulation already and a little over 9,000 current holders. 

If we can get HOGE the marketing/reach that it deserves and to a volume of 1,000,000 (which is pretty easy compared to previous volumes that WSB has produced), HOGE will only continue to grow and increase in price. 

I know you’re probably also wondering about how a pump and dump would affect it. In theory, a pump and dump wouldn’t affect it too bad since HOGE Financial burns some of its supply from each and every transaction. “What this means is that every time HOGE is used, the value of the remaining HOGE in circulation is increased by simultaneously decreasing the supply, while also distributing HOGE to everyone using the token.” After the dump, HOGE will become more scarce, and therefore more valuable. 

In my opinion, the news and hype from the coin that Elon’s attached to can easily be moved to HOGE since his is a meme, and has infinite amount in circulation, so it’s future is realistically unknown to a high extent. The names sound very similar, and since it early in its stage right now, eventually it can easily be trading in the cents and may even reach a dollar along other mainstream coins. 

HOGE can definitely be the next big thing and luckily since, I am assume, most of us are in early, and returns will become more than plentiful. 

For more information about this coin, check out their main page at hoge.finance.

26,m1nt1o,"In case anyone still needs to hear this, Roblox is a direct listing, not an IPO, and that matters.

Keeping this short and sweet because I’m high af but I keep seeing comments like “hOw mUCh cAn I eXPecT RoBlOx to go UP ToMmoRrow” in the daily discussion thread, so I figure this is necessary.

the reason IPOs go uppp on the first day trading is because the banks that carry the companies through the deal are incentivized to make the IPO price as low as possible so they get the most money from the process. 

For a direct listing that is not the case, since the company’s aim is to release the price as close to fair value as possible so they maximize their profits from the offering without too many shares being left unsold, which will lower the price and looks bad. 

Other companies that have Direct Listed:


PLTR: opened at $10 (my claim to fame is buying it at this price on opening), and closed at $9.50

Spotify: Opened at $165.90, closed at $149.01 

Asana: Opened at $27, closed at $28.80


There’s others, but as I said, it’s Tuesday which means I’m blazed so I’m too lazy to look them up.

Note: this is NOT a bear case for roblox! I’ve been too busy buying and selling DASH puts because of u/WBuffetJr to do any research.

88,m1o4cz,"Naked shorting - Market Manipulation
So as I have previously posted I participated in the private  placement of ScreenPro back in the early fall. I have been simply amazed with volume out the gates. ScreenPro was up listed and started trading last Friday and approximately 45M shares have been traded.

Please keep mind ScreenPro purchased a shell corporation Compel Capital and that shell had 330M shares attached to it, so part of the process is that the private equity shareholders of ScreenPro would have their ScreenPro shares pro rated at about 4.68 to get to the Compel Float. The news release indicated the transfer should be completed by March 15, 2021

This current volume is truly amazing considering the fact that I have yet to receive my transfer documents with new shares, so in essence I cannot sell any. I have spoken to a number of other investors who also stated they have not received theirs , so it would be safe to assume that most of the investors who participated in the private placement also have yet to receive theirs.

So the million dollar question is how have we traded 45 M shares in the first three days. I know that IRROC has been contacted and a complaint filed.

This is market manipulation we have people selling shares that they do not have in their possession nor can the provide shares upon the required 2 day period.

This will come to pass but I think a few nefarious individuals new they could take advantage of the situation. The fact remains shares could only be offered if one has possession of them.

I look forward to the short squeeze and suspect their are few houses that have some explaining to do to IRROC.
