2,m1waof,"REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!

Also, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:

 

# üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çü¶çüåôüíéüëê

First, let's look at the players involved here.

# The shorts

On the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.

# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)

Marker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the ""fools"" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).

# The longs

On the long side, we have you glorious apes  ü¶ç ü¶ç ü¶ç, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.

Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this.

It all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.

[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)

[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.

# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze

Some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).

First, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))

Now, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.

At some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.

Similarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.

Remember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.

You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.

# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?

Some people ask: ""Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?"" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).

In fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be ""name your price"" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.

# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:

**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**

Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in.","This is why GAMESTOP won't STOP, and why $100k is NOT A MEME. (REPOSTED)",1.0,1615378921,zimmah

I just wanted to post it here as it gives a very good explanation of naked short selling. Sorry in advance if this is not allowed.

I've made a PDF of all 10 parts in case you want to print it out and read it: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kt0\_LZtZ0eB2ngkIXVKWaGrUc\_04HKz/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kt0_LZtZ0eB2ngkIXVKWaGrUc_04HKz/view?usp=sharing)

A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in Stock Market

[**Resources**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Resources%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

Get your tinfoil hat out, its time to see what you think you want to see but don't really want to. This is perfect for any newbie trying to understand what is going on and how the system has ended up the way it has.

Tl;Dr at end.

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** [u/bEAc0n](https://www.reddit.com/u/bEAc0n/)) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention¬† in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry‚Äôs regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

Edit: apparently people cant bother to even type ""Cede and co"" into the internet.

One of the fall outs from the 2008/2009 depression was the complete destruction of my industry. I held on for a few years just from mind numbing hard work (80 hour weeks and no vacations) and a huge dose of creativity. But in the end I was Wily Coyote. I woke up one day and found nothing but air under me and I was done financially and I had lost my health.

I have been rooting for you kids and cheering you on every day. You have no idea how proud I am of your diamond hands and your courage in the face of such overwhelming power. When the dust finally settles on all of this, somewhere near $1000!, our ""masters of the universe"" will know not to ignore the little guy.

Just to be clear: I¬¥m with all of you on GME and I hold 65 shares to Valhalla but for now I did set some sell orders on different levels to at least secure some profits.

&amp;#x200B;

If the price actually goes to 50k/100k, how can the hedgies buy back all the shorted stock at that price level? They just can¬¥t, or not? They just don¬¥t have the money for it, or not? What whould that mean? They are forced to excecute at least some of it and then go bankrupt instantly? So at least some apes or long hedgies will get their money but maybe 1-5% and the rest get nothing? What then? Stock is at 100k and nobody is there to buy anymore so it drops to 40 bucks pretty much instantly?

&amp;#x200B;
