13,m2vz6q,"Welp, I hope I’m wrong again like I was yesterday. Good news/bad news below 👇🏼

Before the massive short dump, the biggest gamma position yesterday was the $800 strike call option expiring Friday, up from the $100 strike as of Monday, which is partly why I thought the low yesterday would be $300, I thought we were well on the way to a gamma squeeze the likes of which would dwarf the January move. Then the Texas sized short dump showed up...

Still, in terms of single strike options, the $800 is the biggest position which grew massively yesterday. 

Bad news is, the gamma position that grew even more (I’m guessing this happened mostly before the giant dump) is the $250 strike position mostly on the put side but also on the call side, the $250 strike gamma position makes up about 60% of total gamma open interest right now, so it looks like they’ve pinned us at the $250 range until EOW. 

Good news is: call open interest is still getting extra gamma squeezy and after tomorrow’s expiration the vast majority of gamma open interest is huge call volume so next week we can expect major upside movement to continue (depending of course on how much manipulation we might see)",GME $250 range likely pinned until EOW (hope my monumental retardation proves me to be wrong again),1.0,1615484476,Retail_revolutionist
14,m2vzer,"The auto industry is very dependent in the general sate of the economy. During the 2008 crisis GM nearly went bankrupt, if it wasn’t saved by Obama, it could very well ceased to exist. During the 2020 crisis you would expect the auto industry to be severely affected, specially a manufacturer that makes cars that are more expensive that average.

Yet, Tesla was THE stock of 2020 and I feel like an idiot for not buying.

There are companies that produce MORE evs than Tesla, so Tesla isn’t even the largest EV manufacturer. What has been driving it’s near infinite growth? Is it over hyped? Will it stabilize at some price or will it keep having near infinite growth forever?

During the winter, we periodically have slow weeks, maybe 1-3 weeks a year, where we are laid off due to lack of work and collect unemployment for those down weeks.

Teva is grossly undervalued. The CEO restructured the company cutting all the dead weight in the last couple of years making it profitable while it’s making more billions in revenue than its current market cap. Teva is saving lives by making cheaper, generic product of expensive medicine that would otherwise not be affordable. Unlike other huge pharma companies already worth 100s of billions of dollars, Teva market cap is low by comparison with an extremely low P/E ratio and has potential to 10x in value. Unlike recent stocks that already increased 5000% in a couple months where people are fomoing in at the top, this ship has not sailed yet. Its price is the lowest it has been in decades so getting in now has lower risk but a huge upside.

The price right now is %80+ lower than all time high which was \~6 years ago. It has spent more time in the last 2 decades at more than double this price and is gravitating back to the 20-30 range in the near future, especially when considering inflation. Its last stock split was in 2004 where its price was around $28 and only increased in following years until 2016. Inflation since then till now is %40+, meaning if it kept up with inflation the price now should be at around $40 but it is available for $10.5.

There is also a decent amount of shorts trying to keep the price down during this period of consolidation so people (and some huge investors) will lose interest and sell the bottom while the shorts can eventually load up their bags at such low prices on the way back up. However, there is starting to be a lot more interest and traction for the price to increase in the last year as it sets a new trend to make a come back.

Disclaimer: I hold some Teva because I like and believe in it. However, unlike some shills I am not saying I like the price point After it increases 10x in a short time period and saying it is a safe, low risk high reward buy at that price point.

Lastly, Teva literally means nature and who doesn’t like nature.

This is obviously not financial advice.",Why I like TEVA,1.0,1615484757,bestzec

41,m2w4o4,"Roblox is widely viewed as one of the key beneficiaries of COVID-19 as lock-down orders, school shut-downs, and parents dealing with their young children 7 days a week permeated the world. The data supports this as Daily Active Users (DAU) doubled on a YoY basis in a short timeframe. Roblox provides 3D virtual world experiences to over 36M DAUs.
During the pandemic, growth exploded and ~75% of children aged 9 to 12 use the platform. To continue its growth, Roblox is adding events to capture additional users and hours spent on the platform.



🚀🚀 One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.



🚀🚀🚀  Roblox isn't your traditional developer or publisher of video games nor is it a video gaming company as the business model combines gaming and social. Roblox fits the Andreessen Horowitz model as it can be free and it's widely available across gaming consoles, PCs, and even mobile (iOS and Android) and, more importantly, friends can play together across different platforms. From a business model sense, Roblox is a platform company that has a network effect, the more users who engage with the platform will, in turn, invite their friends. From a ""social"" point of view, Roblox users spend 2.5X more time on Roblox than YouTube. 




🚀🚀🚀🚀 On the other side of the platform are developers who create ""experiences"" (or games) for the players and, in 2019, developers created over 20M experiences. The key, however, is that Roblox provides the tools for developers to create a game and, more importantly, as players get older, some develop games on Roblox. Monetization occurs when some users buy Robux to pay developers for an experience or virtual items for their avatar. In essence, there are two self-reinforcing network effects occurring where more players will invite their friends who will become players and more players on Roblox will create more developers to create additional content..



🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 In some ways, the business model is similar to eBay's (EBAY) business model as eBay created a platform to connect sellers with buyers and sellers pay eBay to list their goods. The difference with Roblox is that not all players buy Robux and, rather than Roblox taking 100% of Robux's sales, Roblox takes a percentage of Robux sales as its fee. However, do not be fooled that Roblox may take only a ""small fee"" as it is estimated that the fees that Roblox charge its developers are in excess of 70% (Adopt Me!: The most popular game you've never played) and while Roblox may take at least 70%, for those who purchase Robux via the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, fees to those platforms, i.e. Google and Apple, are 30%.
