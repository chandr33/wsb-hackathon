Where is the media coverage on this?

With the advent of the ecological crisis forcing 10,000 - 100,000 species on the brink of extinction each year (WWF), this philanthropic movement from WSB should be headlining the news everywhere.

If you do a quick google search wallstreetbets and donations, nothing pops up regarding the recent generous movement. Just wanted to point out how filtered media outlets are as it seems like they only post stories that contribute to the narrative that WSB is some kind of collective hive mind bent on manipulating the market... when WSB has probably done more good in these past months than those big corporations have in their lifetimes.

I've seen a couple of posts touch on this subject, but never go in depth. If fines are the only punishments handed out, whats to stop the hedges from letting the shorts FTD and paying the price of that? 

I'm sure there are plenty of greased pockets in the SEC, DTCC, and the government, so what's stopping them from siding with the shorters and leaving everyone holding next to nothing? 

I'm hella excited for this squeeze, whenever it may be, I just hope there aren't ways for the shorters to weasel their way out of paying out to the masses, if it means they can pay out someone who will only recirculate the money back into the 0.1%.
