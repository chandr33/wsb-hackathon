This was January 28th when this rocket was about to lift off (not red crayon circles):

As you can see GME reached a price of around 419$ per share (\*rocket emoji\*)

This is a picture of todays lift off (once again - red crayon pls):

As you can see GME reached a price of around 340$ per share today and it was just starting the lift off.

The super smart monkeyfellas maybe already noticed (so probably nobody cause nobody is reading this anymore)

In January it took them about 80 minutes to dumb the price to 152$... (I am just rounding here cause you get the idea even without the exact numbers)

Dear Congressman,
Today the GameStop stock took a rapid plummet of 40% of its share value after a steady climb for the past week.
However, a journalist named Wallace Witkowski with Market Watch published an article speaking of it's rapid descent on March 10, 2021 at 11:55am EST. The stock did not fall until 12:18pm EST.
This is clear evidence that mainstream media is siding with the Hedge Funds to try and spread fear while getting people to sell, thus further dropping the stock price so that shorts can be cleared at lower trading prices.
I implore you to please look into this. Pressure the SEC, DTCC and your peers to get to the bottom of this price manipulation. This is not fair, free-market trading, and these coordinated attacks cannot go without consequence.
Here is a tweet from DavidNIO, who documented the publication when it happened. As expected, the article has since been re-released at a later time that fits the time-line after the stock's price fall.
https://mobile.twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061?s=19

(Bullish trend but significant dip not bad time to buy)

Or like the crash earlier was a good time to buy don’t let em get into your head if you have the cash you can buy more stocks if it’s at a cheaper price to average out but if your not confident in it passing your new cost average be careful might tuck you 

pre market and post market can be good tools but be careful there imo 

Don’t panic sell

Use recent support and resistances as anylsis and consider long term support as well to assess overall position 

I do think there was an organized crash at the same time of Gme and amc by hedge funds that had short positions

Fuck the news they don’t want us winning 

Seems like hedge funds are bribing some media agencies to mainly cover crash not good news 

This is all opinion 

Yahoo finance was buggy today I hear it tends to be but I think they bugged charts intentionally today

It would show then disappear at oddly bad timing for ppl watching the stock 

Or just bug completely could be servers idk 

Roblox ipo was not started until after the crash right after funny timing...

The amc Gme crash time is the exact same 

They want us scared and selling because they’re scared 


After a severe crash on the day still up on the day and last I checked after hours(could be different now) is good signs

Don’t let them get into your head if it’s a good time to sell and your happy with the price he’ll ya but don’t let em scare you it could hit 300 plus again tommorow it could hit 200 but we hit around 350 before that weird crash 

How they arranged it idk wheather they all teamed up to to flood the volume and sell to panic us and get the stock Lower in general or they targeted limits and stop loss limits to crash it idk

Theory take this as you please it’s all opinion

Just like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.

Let's dive in.

*Processing img 1nbfpcza4am61...*

Let's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.

[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https://preview.redd.it/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)

As  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.

This points to two possibilities in my mind.

**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**

The  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.

**Possibility #2 (Likely)**

The  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.

**Conclusion**

In  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember...

The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher &amp; close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**

We have just completed a cup &amp; handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volitilty). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV &amp; will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.

**Why the stock was heavily attacked today &amp; what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**

We established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share &amp; stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad for $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless. They are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try &amp; trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420.

***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock &amp; weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do &amp; turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***

**TL;DR** I like the stock &amp; it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock &amp; the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction &amp; interesting to see &amp; analyse
