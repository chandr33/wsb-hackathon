Please bear (bull) with me

First off: 141 (now 147 and climbing) of my favorite @ avg 86, I like the stock, I buy the dips, dont know how to money, everything I know about markets I learned from here and an after school special from the 80s, I R dum, dont know how to emoji, rocket diamond ape pictures

Scenario: Super Turbo Squeeze of Doom happens, shorts at an ungodly triple digit percentage, price skyrockets, margins are called. Melvin crumbles when forced to cover, citadel crumbles as they are forced to cover, price moons to 4, 5, 6 digits. Domino bankruptcy. As melvin and citadel dont have total assets to cover that price, where is the money coming from? Ive heard DTCC is on the hook, and I've also heard of their $60 gajillion insurance policy, but I haven't found any links or really any mention of this insurance policy anywhere. My foot fingers might not be typing the right words. Can someone please point me in the right direction? 
Rumors I haven't been able to confirm/deny: 60T is based off their assets managed but don't own
60T is based off total assets they own and can theoretically liquidate

30,m4n7tk,"On Friday, March 12, [u/Pakistani\_in\_MURICA](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pakistani_in_MURICA/)  made a post on WSB announcing their adoption of a gorilla. 'Adopted a  Gorilla', the post read, announcing in simple but unmistakable terms the  beginning of a new pact between ape and ape.

Inspired  by Pakistani\_in\_MURICA, other members of the subreddit have been  scouring the globe for apes and other wildlife in need. Armed with  tendies, they come to the rescue.

The  following is a list of primates and other wildlife redditors on WSB  have adopted over just the last couple of days, as reported in the  posts. If I missed anyone, let me know and I'll add them.  #ApesTogetherStrong

Below are the organizations the apes on WSB are donating to. I can't read and don't endorse anything.

[Ape Initiative](https://www.apeinitiative.org/adopt-a-bonobo)

[Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International](https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/adopthomepage/index.html)

[World Wildlife Foundation](https://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/gifts/Species-Adoptions.aspx?sort=2)

The Director of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund sent WSB [a thank you video](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)!

You don‚Äôt get to come at your fellow apes if they aren‚Äôt investing every single cent to their name in GME stock.

Have fun selling at 420.69, üßªüñê. 

Luckily this is not the overbearing sentiment of WSB and GME, but the comments need to stop. If I want to adopt a ü¶ç, or ü¶ß, or shit-smearing homo sapien, that‚Äôs none of your business. I believe in GME and have invested as much as I can afford to lose at the moment. Personally, getting rich is just as important to me as investing in our planet and global community. And buying a new laptop (from GameStop, of course) because I need one. 

This community has instilled more trust in me in my fellow apes than I ever thought I would have honestly. I know I‚Äôm holding until my shares are worth their fair price, and I know my ape family is doing the same. I‚Äôm not worried about when or if the squeeze is squoze, because I like the stock.

But while I have a rough mental estimate of the size of the WSB crowd, I have no sense of the number of institutional players. Recognizing that they‚Äôre all encrusted to their come-encrusted titties, how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting GME?

63,m4nduk,"One thing that YouTubers have not mentioned yet which is a very important pro for AMC is that VODs or videos on demand are not even close to as profitable as the box office releases at theatres. In the time in which people were more exposed to videos on demand more than ever big movies like ""Mulan"" and ""Dumbo"" lost over $100,000,000 each. Also note that this is on their own streaming platform and their is no middle man taking a fee like a Comcast or Amazon etc.... Videos on demand were a nice little extra bonus a month after a movie came out and have shown durring this past year they can never replace movie theatres. Another thing to mention is that as soon as that movie is released digitally pirates scoop it up and have the full HD version ready to stream free on these illegal sites that some people will now go to if its full quality vs the sketchy camera jiggling with muffled sound that ruins the movie. It's too expensive and not even possible for some people with living space to recreate the quality of experience the movie theatre will give you. Im very confident movie studios realized the importance of theatres like AMC and im hoping they are cutting them a much better deal seeing that they went from making 100s of millions of dollars on a single money to not even being able to break even on VOD releases. I can't stress how important a factor this and I really hope Adam Aaron etched a deal that will make AMC a very profitable business as in the past they were losing money as their partners were making $100s of millions of dollars. If anything AMC has the leverage over all these studios to create a better deal to become very profitable. They need each other to work. If anything this makes AMC more of a stock than ever with the data gathered on movie studios experimenting with releasing movies directly on demand. Im very bullish on this longterm and hey it squeezes that's cool.

Also try to name 10 movies that were amazing and you would see from Hulu Netflix and prime. You probably can't because alot of them are low budget and have short turn around times and are short movies. Yes there are a few gems in the mix but the number of movies being pumped out is insane and 99 percent of them feel far from being a movie that was released at a theatre

Alot of people forget that not only does the theatre make the experience much better because of a big screen and great sound but there's also this sense of comfort and community and excitement even if you don't even say hi or even make eye contact. People more than ever need social interaction.

So, it would seems like these days no one could ever fouled you with all the tech and info available. And I was pretty sure of that, at least I thought I was a smarter person. I‚Äôve been in the coins a few months is so, don‚Äôt judge me, I‚Äôm still learning....I was on the right path with all the stable coins whatsoever.... I wanted to have more B / T / C, so I heard something about Elon Musk on Twitter, I read the comments and someone (spam obviously) shared a link about Tesla and B/ t / c, It had his picture and everything. It read like this: In celebration we will be matching your B T C 10times after you send to this wallet. 
So, I hesitate a bit, it seemed so good to be true. But sadly, I went for it and send 0.02 B / T / C (Because I thought it really was Elon Musk) and .... lost my money. Obviously I never got anything back. Long story short. Learned the hard way. Beginners error. I‚Äôm
So F&amp;3$‚Äù‚Äù mad and frustrated. It was not like a had a lot and I lost it because of a idiot that scammed a lot of people like me. Because you must know, I searched on the block chain and he/she received more than 20 transactions like mine and returned none. Ugh. Great way to learn.

93,m4njxs,"Hi people,

Here is a little analysis of how Hedgies market makers are trying to avoid the awaited gamma squeeze.

Just quickly, the gamma squeeze occurs when market makers buy the stock they are sellings options for and drive its price higher. This will cause more calls to strike and then oblige them to buy more which drives the price even higher in a vicious loop...

However, it seems that since the last squeeze in January, they are improving their defenses in order to avoid another squeeze.

One I noticed, is the lowering of shorting fees. In fact, when a shorty borrows a share he does it against a fee. Of course, when he borrows he sells which drives the stock price lower.

By lowering the borrowing fees, the market makers are sure the price is kept low and hence the higher calls are unlikely to strike and this way avoiding to be gamma squezzed.

Here you can see that on last Friday the fee was only 0.8%:

However, shorters can't short forever because summing small fees becomes expensive fees over time. Also this means all those shares got to be recovered.

This implies that even if the market makers manages to escape a sudden gamma squeeze that may rise the share price very high and very fast. The shorts will keep the price up long term as they will have to cover over time.

To conclude, hedgies and market makers are rather checkmated. They either pay the price at once in a beautiful squeeze or flatten the curve making the price of GME more stable over time.


Finally, this is a retard ideas and not financial advice :) !
