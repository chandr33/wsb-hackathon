Welcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.

# Pivot Point

The pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**

For example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cdv56c1km0m61...*

&amp;#x200B;

R1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily Low

R2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High – Daily Low)

S1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily High

S2 = Pivot Point – (Daily High – Daily Low)

*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point – Daily Low)*

*S3 = Daily Low – 2 x (Daily High – Pivot Point)*

**LINKING BACK TO GME**

&amp;#x200B;

[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)

&amp;#x200B;

GME-

Resistance Line 1: $195.13

Resistance Line 2: 202.33

Resistance Line 3: 215.87

*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**

*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*

# Relative Strength Index

*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100

RSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence

Above 70: Overbought

&amp;#x200B;

[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)

Current GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)

*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*

**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**

**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**

&amp;#x200B;

[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)

&amp;#x200B;

RSI Value: 72.14

As seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.

# Volume Weighted Average Price

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price. *It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**

*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*

&amp;#x200B;

[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img s2sqhq2ym0m61...*

&amp;#x200B;

* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**
* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.
* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**

&amp;#x200B;

[MACD january](https://preview.redd.it/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[MACD march](https://preview.redd.it/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)

&amp;#x200B;

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline.

* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*

# Other Indicators

Since I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.

&amp;#x200B;

[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**

Anyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**

Friday night, I decided to stay up late, smoke some bud, and mess around on the computer. For whatever reason, I got the big brained idea of transferring my portfolio to TD Ameritrade. Great idea, I reasoned. So I initiated the transfer and being the smooth brain ape that I am, I did not realize it would take 5-8 business days. Fuck! This isn't good. So at 1am I called their support line and waited on hold for about 20 minutes and spoke to a very nice lady. She told me that the transfer team comes in Monday and since I called early enough, they could most likely stop it. Great! No worries!
Monday rolls around and I get a response from support to confirm that it was indeed early enough to cancel and I should be ok. Last night, after an awesome day of GME gainz, I get an email from RH that said they received the ACATS transfer request and my account is now deactivated and it will take 5-8 business days. FUCK! 
By locking my own self out of my account, I have officially graduated from smooth brained ape to smooth brained retarded ape 🧠🦍,.
This is a new type of 💎🙌  that I'd like to refer too as Forced 💎🙌  I suggest you apes join me. Can't sell what you can't access.","I got super high, and then my smooth brain and extra chromosome kicked in. My story of how became an official member of WSB 💎🙌🧠🦍",1.0,1615301956,vaelon
