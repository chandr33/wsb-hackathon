20,m6q9cc,"Once in the land of Terra in the City of Memestonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future. 

One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.

Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visitors upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.

""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release. 

And so they did, but then they had a problem.

The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know. 

And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.

Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""

And this was the game that they made up:

#Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours to flip again. 

This game ensured that no one got left holding a bag, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in. 

The magical power of projecting your face on the wall is pretty annoying but it's not illegal in the City of Memestonkia to this day.",This post is manipulation but not market manipulation: A Dungeon Master's Guide to Exiting GME with Maximum Profits &amp; Prophets; Power to the Player's Hands Guide - A Short Story,1.0,1615949032,artmagic95833

26,m6qas4,"[No, anchoring \(at least in this context\) is not the act of telling stories in front of a camera while seated behind a desk.  We're talking about \\""anchoring bias\\"" and it's perhaps the most powerful tool in setting expectations.](https://preview.redd.it/uh5ipj5u3in61.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a56c644bc29ffff3bdec5993400fcea88434d049)

Let's say you go to an AMC movie theater (why would any of you apes go to another one right now?) and want to buy some popcorn.  There are 3 sizes of popcorn, small-medium-large, priced at $7, $7.50, and $8.50.  The movie theater wants to sell you the largest popcorn, so rather than pricing small at $4, medium at $6 and large at $10, they know you will tell yourself ""it's not that much more to get a large instead of a small, and I get a free refill"" so you buy the large. every time. 

Anchoring happens every day in your life- you see something on Amazon that has the ""original price"" as $150, but that number is crossed out and the price is $49.99 with free Prime shipping- you feel you are getting a deal and you buy.  Your house's value (or apartment rent) are based on the comparable prices around where you live.  All this is called an anchoring bias. 

**What does this have to do with stocks and GME/ AMC?  Everything.**

The value of a stock has very little to do with anything other than an agreed upon price between parties.  The value of your stock to you is anchored by the price you paid for it.  Anchoring is also why most retail investors are awful, and why paper hands exist.  If you buy a stock for $100 and it goes to $30 then Prospect theory (the idea that losses hurt twice as bad as gains feel good) tells us that you will pray and hope and beg the universe to just let you get back to $100 so you can sell.  If you buy a stock and it goes to $120, you feel like a genius stock picker, but think to yourself ""I bet it could go to $130!""  and you wait for your bias to be confirmed.

I've seen some incredible DD on this sub, and I'm further convinced that while option expiration dates and squeezes are part of the equation, the more important deciding factor will be anchoring bias.

When you see a meme that says ""$100k is not a meme"", you re-anchor on $100k and you get diamond hands.  Then market opens and the stock goes from $320 to $260, then $260 to $180. Suddenly your fear of loss kicks in (prospect theory again) and your new ""value"" for the stock is $320- not $100k.  Then you see another person say ""No less than $1MM for my shares"" and you get re-anchored again. Then the cycle repeats. The hedges know this, and they're pushing the stock down to get you to re-anchor and accept some paltry amount for your stock.

The psychological warfare is real. Short attacks, news media stories, shills and bots are all designed to get you to re-anchor your expectations so that you are willing to accept $100, $200, $500 for your shares. The hedge funds NEED your shares, the shorts and synthetics are in excess of the total number of GME shares issued. The outcome is inevitable, the only thing that will keep this rocket from launching is your stupid anchoring bias that make you think your stocks aren't worth what they really are.

**How do we fight anchoring bias/ TLDR:**

Simple. Pick a number, any number (I'll anchor you at $1MM a share, you decide from there). Write it down. Tape it somewhere, tattoo it on your hand, paste it on your computer.  Remind yourself that everything that happens between now and the Moon landing is designed to re-anchor you. Dips don't matter. Volume doesn't matter. Dates don't matter. The only thing that matters is that you wonderful apes hold the line, don't fall for the re-anchoring attempts, buy the dips and hold those shares until we moon!","What is ""anchoring"" and why it will decide who wins.",1.0,1615949171,Turambar1984

At 300$ there will be 11,619 Puts ITM and 77,465 Calls ITM.

At 200$ there are 19,620 Puts ITM and 54,045 Calls ITM. 

At 150$ there will 50,619 Puts ITM and 43,915 Calls ITM.

&amp;#x200B;

**So what does this mean for friday 03/19?**

Every GME stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies valhalla and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on.

Every Dollar higher than 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters. So I guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday: to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$.

Every Stock price below 150 $ on 03/19 will end in... well... So many PUTS then in the money, this will end really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**   
GME above \~170$ on friday, Calls will win, Stock will rise more.

GME above 300 $ on friday: Start to Valhalla

Dr. Goodall obviously does a lot of speaking engagements, educational programs (roots and shoots) and conservation work at Gombe. Dr. Galdikas currently runs a care center with over 330 orphaned orangutans, and is working very diligently to purchase and preserve their habitat and save it from mining and palm oil companies, along with ongoing conservation and research in Tanjung Puting.

I hold AMC Shares but hold a contrarian view to you and believe it's overpriced at these levels. Why?

Because although their share price has increased by \~2.5x since I last bought, their market caps has grown \~7X since my last purchase. Their share dilution has been incredible as a lot of AMC's board have been converting their debt to  equity to dilute AMC shareholders equity. A couple of people on board are hedge fund managers. 

This is AMC's market cap by quarters (notice 12/31 vs. Current):

Last time I tried this was a bit of a dumpster fire, but I'm giving it another go.

I am new to investing, but I am trying to determine my own ""fair market value"" for one share of GME, assuming the squeeze gets squoze at some point, and **after** all the short-interest dust settles, where would a company, such as GameStop, likely trade at based on future outlook?

Remember the vision that RC has discussed in writing regarding GameStop, and the future vision (look the letters up if you need).

&amp;#x200B;

I think the safest **industry(s)** we can assume, given the ""digital-first"" strategy would be:

\-E-Commerce/Retail + Strategic physical locations

\-Gaming Industry (what can this mean for GME?)

What PE would the stock realistically trade at, based on industry/competitors?

Potential Industry Competitors:

Amazon, Netflix, Ebay(?), Overstock(?), Target(?), Walmart(?), Best Buy(?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**

\+E-commerce retail, expanding reach in current markets (US/CA/AUS/EU)

\+Consolidate physical stores, Free Up Cash for next Cycle.

\+Multi-Channel Distribution (Gaming PCs, Video Games, Streaming?)

\+Power-Up Reward subscription service

\+(Possible) Streaming Service

\+(Possible) In-Store Entertainment, Kids and Adults

\+(Possible) P2P Marketplace??

\+(Possible) Capture microtransaction market (w/ P2P marketplace?)

\+others?

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons**

\-Past performance

\-Lower demand for physical games

\-Roughly 80% of current ""gaming industry"" market share is held by F2P Microtransactions &amp; Asia/Pacific audience.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the worst that can happen right?

I just want to know what a **share of GME should be worth**, using a realistic fundamental approach to an evolving/pivoting business, and what the ""generally expected"" price would be if everything goes ""according to plan"" (given 80-90% success probably, for instance).

&amp;#x200B;

**Anything you guys wanna add/remove** let me know, I will soon add some Industry data and revenue projections as soon as I research and write it all down..

92,m6qwix,"Shares of Roblox Corp. (RBLX) rallied 6.1% in afternoon trading, after the tween-centric gaming platform received a bullish endorsement from Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum, who said the company is ""uniquely positioned at the intersection of content and social."" 

Crum initiated coverage of Roblox with a buy rating and stock price target of $85, which is 11.0% above current levels.


üöÄ


Roblox received its first Wall Street analyst coverage on Monday, with Stifel rating the online gaming platform a Buy with a $85 price target, representing potential upside of 18% from Monday's close.

According to Stifel, the company is primed to benefit from two ""viral loops"" that should reinforce Roblox's network effect and drive higher engagement and monetization on the platform: content and social.


üöÄ


One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games. If the framework is adopted by gaming companies, they believe that companies will benefit from platform convergence and grow larger and faster.


  üöÄ


Roblox spent more on the products it sold during the most recently completed quarter than it was able to generate in revenues.

So I am working on a project recently, and I was scraping Reddit posts data to find out mentions for each ticker. I know that the scraper I used is not set up perfectly -- a lot of missing data happened, but I aggregated and scraped past month's top mentions. I use the first derivative to measure the interest for tickers and the second derivative to measure the growth of interest for tickers. So the chart is over here.

So NIO is the only stock with higher interests and growth of interest than its mention rank for daily, weekly, and monthly mentions -- what it means? It means that people are interested in it, and the talk around it is growing, and it snowballs. We can expect more discussion over NIO very soon. Why? From the posts, it seems that people are discussing it. You can check those yourself from [here](https://member.chatanalytic.com/demo_page_single/NIO).

&amp;#x200B;

Another interesting ticker would be NOK. Its weekly and monthly interest and growth of interest ranks are higher than the mention's rank, so definitely look into it. The other two tickers that might be good to look at are TLRY and APHA. They both have a higher interest growth of interest rank than their mentions rank.
