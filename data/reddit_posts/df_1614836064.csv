They are building systems to track mentions then publishing them on Boomer News.

Good News: Movements will happen quicker

Bad News: We are constantly monitored which allows for faster adjustments (less surprise effect)

We should find a way to communicate tickers without saying it in such a way that can be easily filtered.

For example 👩‍🦳✉️🥚 or 🦝🪁🐅

Nothing crazy hard but at least a human ha to read to understand not an Algo.

Fun fact: They publish all the other plays and call them targets but they refuse to acknowledge GME existence or exposure............ wonder why?",Thoughts:,0.71,1614836851,WTF_is_risk
29,lxdtfq,"I’m not talking about a pilgrimage (my term for a group of Vlad Tenevs) of shitty haircutted boys from Bulgaria, I’m talking about modern day Robinhoods, taking from the rich and giving to the poor.

Until a couple of months ago I hadn’t heard about this sub, about GME and shorts.  About important things like diamond hands and apes.  

You Apes rock!  Though I can’t afford to cash in on the magic this sub offers, I thank god there are people out there, helping out average people and giving them an edge in a market dominated by the ultra elite who want to see nothing more than their pockets lined while you stay downtrodden, middle class or worse.

Thank you for your efforts in helping out your fellow ape and giving them a taste of those sweeeeet tendies.

Modern day saints.  Legit Robinhoods.  I’m glad so many of you will have company on the moon.

89,lxe9jc,"My recent DD on XL fleet:

1. The whole EV sector is down, including Tesla, NIO, GM, Ford, etc. because they are having a hard time making and selling new EV cars (shortage of chips). There is no doubt XL should be the best choice at this moment for fleet electrification, given the fact that they have a proven profitable business model;
2. ""SPAC bubble"", if currently there is one. I lost money on CCIV, EHang, WKHS, etc. whatever hot EV stocks or SPACs almost 50% of drop on EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. XL is barely keeping up in a overall short term bearish yet extremely volatile market right now. The damage has done from MW's shit report;
3. What can you expect? With both a stimulus check and an infrastructure plan on the agenda, and employment rate and economy recovery data are looking good and strong with the help of vaccine, traditional companies and industries stocks are looking bullish! Might not be those ones who market ""first deliverable EV cars or product will be at 2030"", to be exaggerate;
4. Fuck MW's report, I don't see anything substantial but taking advantages of shorting a great company on an overall short-term downtrend market. With a proven electrification business model making real profit and great vision and good deals on XL grid and partnership on making refuse trucks, and possibly more charging stations than the 1000 UBS arena ones.
