The market obviously was stopped (haulted) due to this dive. But why do you think it happened?
Do you have proof to back up what you think happened?

We have them where we want them. I’m super impressed with the strength of everyone, do not crack. Stay strong and HOLD!! 💪💪💪🦍🦍🦍🦍 Expect more of the same tomorrow. Then Friday they have to start covering and the rise will begin. 

Next Friday (19th of March) it will be quadruple witching day (occurs on the third Friday of the month of every quarter, in March, June, September, and December, and refers to the simultaneous expiration of single-stock options, single-stock futures, and stock-index options and stock-index futures). The volume that day will be HUGE!!!!!! And the launch to the moon WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!! 

Please all stay strong and most importantly HOLD, especially if they launch another attack or if the market pauses.. also if they drop the price after the market closes. Buy any dips when possible and relax. I will see you all on the moon fellow Apes!

What the shorts aren't realizing is that we're tired of them fucking the little guy in general, and every time they pull these stunts: buying halts, pre-prepared media articles, massive price manipulation in broad daylight, it only reinforces our belief that we're on the right side of this one.

So thank you. If you had told me I could SPEND $1000 to put a short selling hedge fund out of business, I'd do it. The fact I'm already up thousands just makes it that much sweeter. And every time they pull this crap, my price point to sell goes up.

I'd advise buyers of Credit Acceptance Corporation to understand the regulatory and punitive risk associated with their Civil Action Lawsuit. The potential costs of these issues could be huge, much larger than what's being considered currently. Damages can be treble for various predatoy lending violations not to mention possible violations to interstate commerce.

They did receive financing recently. I have no information what their collateral is but if it's cars- that's a depreciating asset in a changing market segment. When I look at their technical trends, I wonder what changed in 2015 / 2016 / 2017 when the slope of growth changed. PEST analysis can give you a few clues. Institutional Ownership has decreased approx 4.75% over the last 3 months and I suspect this trend will continue considering PE and Book Value Per Share.

37,m2an7x,"So, on Monday I threw over $6k into GME 500 calls, expiring 3/12.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, I was up to $11K in the first hour of market open, but that dwindled away fast as the sideways movement yesterday killed the premium on the options. I was glued to my screen, and watched as each minute my balance fell more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ar2bqghh0am61...*

Then today, I was initially down in the morning just for a minute but suddenly, things picked up big time. At 11:00AM, **I was up $32,000.00.** I currently owe about twice that in student loans, and I told myself I wouldn't sell until the options were worth what I owed in student loans (I refinanced my loans so they are now privately held, and thus I have no hope for forgiveness).

Then, the GME drop and halts happened.

My $32,000.00 dropped to next to nothing in minutes.

While a strike price of 500 for Friday is... doable, it's pretty fucking risky at this point. And with each passing day, the option premium drops significantly (theta at one point was like -4.2).

So, I waited a tiny bit  after the batch of halts (I was basically gambling yet again), and the options were finally about double the price I originally paid. I didn't want to be a slaughtered pig, and rather than focus on the $32,000.00 I missed out on, I realized I should be fucking happy I was able to get out with over $5,000.00 in profit.

I had bought the contracts at an average of $4.8, and sold at $7.05.

**TL;DR: I don't have diamond hands, but I'm not ashamed.** I also am proud that my trade didn't have an impact on the hard work all you apes are doing in holding shares (since they are options contracts). Of course, it would've been great if I held and then they become ITM on Friday, but I'll take a $5K win over a $6K loss anyday.","My $6,000.00 YOLO on 3/12 GME 500 calls: at least I made a profit",1.0,1615414980,phillythompson

41,m2ao2n,"I love this company! Earnings announcement is coming up next week and the stock has been trending down over the past month on the order of \~40%. 

Here's the [S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-030981/) Hims filed Feb 5th 2021. Most of the stats I cite below are directly from the S-1.

Why I'm bullish on HIMS:

(1) Healthcare is a 4.0T market in just the United States. They're in a great position to capture a lot of the migration to telemedicine and men's health in particular.

(2) Hims has a 2.4B market cap (as of 3/10/2021), that's only 22x 9 month trailing revenue! ($107M).

(3) 200% YoY revenue growth in 2019 and 86% YoY revenue growth for the first 9 months of 2020.

(4) 91% of revenue is subscription-based.

(5) Great place to work: 4.6/5.0 on Glassdoor and CEO Andrew Dudum has a [100% approval rate](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-hims-and-hers-EI_IE2090877.11,24.htm).

So they have 280K customers, are making $100M+ a year, and growing revenue nearly 100% YoY. Customers are paying an AVERAGE of \~$500 a year. 91% of their revenue is recurring (subscription). 72% gross margin in 2020. I see them as potentially being the top telemedicine company in the world in a few years. Their CEO is well-liked internally and seems to have his eye on the long-term and [expansion into Asia](https://www.businessinsider.com/ceo-of-hims-reveals-secret-trip-to-asia-2021-1).

If you go to search for the article that is posted in the screenshot of MrDavidNIO's tweet, you'll see that there is no such MarketWatch article under that exact title. However, on the RH app, if you scroll down to the News section of GME, it still lists the MarketWatch article with the **original** title, ""GameStop stock was reaching new heights, but the meme stock just plummeted"". If you open the article, you will see that it is the new article with the revised title, ""[The meme-stock roller coaster just reached new heights of volatility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208)"", which still has the full **original** title in the **URL**.

Dear Congressman,
Today the GameStop stock took a rapid plummet of 40% of its share value after a steady climb for the past week.
However, a journalist named Wallace Witkowski with Market Watch published an article speaking of it's rapid descent on March 10, 2021 at 11:55am EST. The stock did not fall until 12:18pm EST.
This is clear evidence that mainstream media is siding with the Hedge Funds to try and spread fear while getting people to sell, thus further dropping the stock price so that shorts can be cleared at lower trading prices.
I implore you to please look into this. Pressure the SEC, DTCC and your peers to get to the bottom of this price manipulation. This is not fair, free-market trading, and these coordinated attacks cannot go without consequence.
Here is a tweet from DavidNIO, who documented the publication when it happened. As expected, the article has since been re-released at a later time that fits the time-line after the stock's price fall.

Thank you for your deep concern in this matter. I know you are on the side of fair trading, and look forward to hearing your thoughts in future hearings.
