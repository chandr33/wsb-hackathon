I fell in love with GME, the memes on WSB, people following up on promises like eating crayons and ghost peppers, and all the good things people have been doing with their tendies. Like adopting gorillas, elephants, whales, falcons, I love you all and what we have accomplished. 

I understand not everyone is here to destroy hedge funds, and just want their tendies. But there are is a good percentage of people here who are genuinely here to make a statement to the entire world that together, retail investors can make a difference, whether we lose all our money or land on the moon. 

I just really wanted to say the WSB community is fantastic, really proud that you apes are making a difference in the world, and together APE STRONG we can try to send GME to the moon! 

I have gotten so much entertainment and joy the last couple of months that if all else failed and GME went to $0 I would have no regrets. 

I have convinced my wife that once we receive our stimulus checks, to YOLO on GME! She said she is fine investing up to 10k in GME and after explaining what was going in she is on board too! I invested 6k in GME personally and with me and wifes stimmy, we will be in close to 9k. It isn't much but it is honest work. Love you all!

Fund managers are dinosaurs who do nothing with these plans. They tell you just to hold when the market is burning red and then they tell you that their funds are doing amazing while it recovers. Plus good luck making moves within the plans without getting hit because you are ""making too many changes"" in a market that fluctuates daily. My plan for instance makes you change contributions before market close for it to take affect the next day. If the futures crash, too bad! You are locked in. Not to mention that the ""aggressive growth stocks include boomer companies that have already reached the apex of strong movements. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm lucky compared to others.

35,m590bc,"**I'm going to teach you guys about call/put spreads.**

In this guide, we'll use AMC as the example. Let's pretend it is currently trading at $9.28.

# First, some terms you should know:

Option: a contract that gives you the OPTION to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date

Premium: The per-share price paid to the option contract seller for the option

Underlying: The stock on which we are trading options

Long: Means that we are BUYING an option

Short: Means that we are SELLING an option

Call: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to BUY 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

Put: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to SELL 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price

&amp;#x200B;

Now, how can we make money with a small account balance?

# If we have a BULLISH outlook (AMC goes to $13 because Stonks go up üìàüìàüìà)

  

**1.** **YOLO calls (maximum gains, moderate risk):** 

Buy an out-of-the-money (OTM) call for an expiration date and hope the gamble goes your way.

**A long $10C 3/26** ($10 dollar strike call expiring on March 26) position trades for a premium of $1.49 a share, which gives us a total price of $149 per contract (100 shares at $1.49 per share).

This contract is out of the money - meaning the strike price is above the current trading price. 

This is a straight up gamble. If AMC doesn't reach the strike price, the option expires worthless, because buying 100 shares at market price will be cheaper than exercising your right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. In that scenario, we have lost the premium we spent to buy the option.

As $AMC‚Äôs market price approaches the strike price of $10, the option‚Äôs value will go up ‚Äì meaning you could sell the option at a higher premium than you paid for it.

However, we will still lose money on this trade if the price doesn‚Äôt go above $11.49. That can be calculated by adding our per-share premium to our strike price. Since we paid $1.49 per share for the contract at a $10 strike, we need to recoup the premium of $1.49 per share. Hence the breakeven stock price is $11.49.

If AMC manages to hit $13, we‚Äôll be able to exercise the option (and purchase 100 shares at 11.49 each) or sell the contract for the market rate of around $3.00 per share. If we exercise the option, we could immediately sell the 100 shares at market price of $13, earning us $13 - $11.49 = $1.51 per share, or $151 total.

**Net investment and max risk: $149 per contract**  
**Breakeven price: $11.49 ($10 strike + $1.49 premium)**   
**Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì $1.49) x 100**

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **Debit spread (limited gains, lower risk)**

This option strategy is a two-tiered approach. In short, we open both a long and a short position at different strike prices.

Let‚Äôs say we think AMC will go up to around $13 by 3/26.

We can **buy**, or **open a long $10c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.49 per share ($149 per contract). This is out of the money.

We then **sell** or **open a** **short $12c 3/26** position, which trades for a premium of $1.00 per share ($100 per contract). It‚Äôs also out of the money, but since we are selling it, we get the $100.

Net-net, we spend $49 per contract here, which significantly reduces our risk profile and makes our break-even price much lower. Now let‚Äôs see what happens:

**AMC @ 13**

If AMC hits $13, both of our options are in the money. The $10c will be worth 3.00/share, and the $12c will be worth $1/share, which means when we close the options, we collect $300 and pay $100, giving us a gross profit of $200. If we subtract our initial cost of $49, we get a net profit of **$151**. Important to note that our profits are capped at $151/contract since we only have a spread of $2 between the strike prices.

**AMC @ 11**

If AMC hits $11, only our long contract is in the money. The $10c will be worth $1.00/share, and the 12c will be worthless. This means we can close our options and pocket the difference, which is **$51.** 

Net investment and max risk: $49 per contract  
Breakeven price: $10.49 ($10 strike + 0.49 net premium)   
Net P/L at $13: **+151** per contract ($3.00 ‚Äì 1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)  
Net P/L at $10: **+51** per contract ($1.00 ‚Äì 0.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.49 x 100)

# If we have a BEARISH outlook (AMC goes to $6 because fuck AMC, all my homies hate AMC üìâüìâüìâ)

# 1. YOLO Puts (maximum gains, moderate risk) 

A **long 8P 3/26** position trades for a premium of $1.05 per share, so $105 per contract.

Like the YOLO call, this is a gamble, and if you don‚Äôt have a lot of equity in your account, it‚Äôs unwise unless you have a really good feeling, or it came to you in a dream.

The same principle with breakeven prices applies here. Our 8p costs 1.05 a share, so for us to break even, the share price needs to reach $6.95 (8 ‚Äì 1.05). To exercise this option, we would buy 100 shares of $AMC at market price of $6.95, then sell those shares to the sucker on the other end of our option for $8 per share.

If the price doesn‚Äôt go below $8, our option expires worthless.

If the price hits $5.50, we can exercise the option: Buy 100 shares of AMC at current market price ($5.50) and then sell them for $8 a share (our strike price). Alternatively, we can sell the option for the market price, which would be around $2.50, netting us $1.45 per share.

Net investment and max risk: $105 per contract

Breakeven price: $6.95 ($8 strike ‚Äì $1.05 premium) 

Net P/L at $5.50: **+145** per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì $1.05) x 100

**2.** **Credit spread (limited gains, low risk)**

Again, we use the same approach with spreads as before. 

We can open the same **long 8p 3/26** position for 1.05/share, and simultaneously open a **short 6p 3/26** position for 0.33/share. That gives us a total cost of 0.72 per share, making our breakeven price 7.28 (8 - 0.72).

The spread is the maximum potential gain per share. So even if AMC tanks and goes below $3-4 a share, our maximum profit potential doesn‚Äôt change after it drops past 6.

Let‚Äôs see the math:

**AMC @ 5.50**

Both of our options are in the money. The 8p will be worth 2.50 per share, and 6p will be worth 0.50 a share. When we close the options, we collect $250 for selling the 8p, and pay $50 for closing the 6p, for gross earnings of $2.00 per share. If we subtract our buy-in of .72, we are left with 1.28 per share as our profit or **$128**.

**AMC @ 7.00**

Again, here only our long position is in the money. The 8P will be worth 1.00 per share, and the 6P is worthless. We can close the option out and pocket our difference of 0.28 per share, or **$28.**

  

Net investment and max risk: $72 per contract  
Breakeven price: $7.28 ($8 strike ‚Äì 0.72 net premium)   
Net P/L at $5.50: **+128** per contract ($2.50 ‚Äì 0.5) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)  
Net P/L at $7.00: **+28** per contract ($1.00) x 100 ‚Äì (0.72 x 100)

# What if we have a NEUTRAL OUTLOOK?

We can still make money using a covered call, but we need a bit more capital to start.

First, we need to buy 100 shares of AMC at 9.28, which makes our cost basis (what we paid for it) $928.

If we think that the share price will trade mostly sideways, we can open a **short, covered call** position. This means we are selling the option for a buyer to purchase our 100 shares from us for a given price.

In our example, we open a **short 12C 3/26** position, which means we agree to sell 100 shares of AMC on 3/26 for $12 a share. The premium for this contract is $1.00 per share, so we pocket the $100. We keep this $100 no matter what, and we can use it to offset our cost basis. So regardless of what happens, our new cost basis for 100 shares of AMC is now $828.

Let‚Äôs see what happens on 3/26 when the contract expires:

**AMC @ 10**

The 12C contract expired worthless ‚Äì nobody is going to exercise a 12c when the market price is only $10.

Thus, our net gain is $**172.** We made 0.72 per share on each of our 100 shares as the price rose to $10, **and** we keep the $100 premium we were paid for selling the 12c. 

**AMC @ 11.99**

The 12C contract still expired worthless. Our net gain is **$371** ‚Äì we made $2.71 on the share price rising and keep the $100 premium. 

**AMC @ 14.50**

The 12C contract ended up in the money, which means that it will be exercised. Now, we sell our shares at $12 a share, earning $1,200. We also get keep the premium, so our total proceeds are $1,300. We do lose out on the potential unrealized gains we would have had if we were free to sell the shares on the market for $14.50.

Once the contract expires, we are free to do what we want with the shares: sell them for a profit or sell another covered call.

I just see this going south real fast for short sellers on these companies. These short sellers are putting together these reports and analyzing these companies in a way that they have been running for years and these companies giving the public misinformation about their future aspects. In all of these cases I think all the short sellers are taking in where the company is now and judging the future of the company based on that. 

These are all start up companies that have huge potential with a lot of cash on hand from the SPAC merger acquisition and funding from outside sources. 

All of these companies have the ability to disrupt their industry. 

Yes these are all speculative stocks and have risk but have a huge upward potential but the share price is quite low. 

These short sellers are putting out reports that if any individual looked into their presentations, earning reports, interviews from directors or CEO's, news letters, etc they will see the same information that these short reports have in them. Retail investors just go in with the name and don't look into the risks of the these companies but only look at the growth outlook. Throwing these short reports out is just an insult to long term investors looking at the risks and out weighting them. Then these companies collect profit in 1 day or week or whatever they want because they just put the bad information out in one shitty article. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say this is just a pump and dump in the other direction for short sellers to bash a company that is trying to make it and with these reports it really hurts the company in the long run. 

I also don't want to hear about Nikola and how they were right on that because that shit was being called a scam since last April and retail investors called that months before. That shit was obvious and it took these short sellers months after that to say o hey that Nikola company is a fraud and Trevor Milton guy sexually assaults people and will murder you.","Short Sellers on SPAC (RIDE, CCIV, XL Fleet, SoFi) and Why They Are on The Wrong Side",1.0,1615770655,Either_Loan_6516

Cricut announced updates to their subscription service that would require users to pay $10 if they want to upload more than 20 images a month. Any sane person knows you can go through this in a day or two (especially when Design Space doesn‚Äôt let you edit stuff in their shit software). It appears this is all in a money grab to look more lucrative for their upcoming IPO. Yes, this makes sense, however it‚Äôs one thing if the $10 actually gets you something? software is still shit with limited features and they are pulling a bait and switch on upload capabilities that were always advertised (and still are on their product listings!) as free. ‚ÄúCreative freedom should always be free‚Äù my ass.  I refuse to pay monthly for hardware that I already own (and purchased with the understanding that the software and uploads were All free).  Customers are obvious pissed and leaving Cricut in droves for main competitor, Silhouette. They are also doing their best to drive away future customers as well.

Seems fair because risk vs reward of going against several opponents by yourself balances it out. But it doesn't, the hedgies are using every trick disposable to them to get you to loosen your grip; they let go of the rope for a bit and then let the big fat anchor hedgie pull as soon as you try to gain ground.

91,m59f9h,"An open letter response to Jim Cramer

I just read Jim Cramer‚Äôs post regarding his life story, investment practices, and thoughts on Gamestop. You can read it [here](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/jim-cramer-go-ahead-bet-against-me/ar-BB1eA94L). I don‚Äôt speak for the entire subreddit, but I have been *deeply* involved in the entire Gamestop movement, since around $10. I‚Äôm a full-time trader and anyone who knows me can attest to my diligence in studying this phenomenon. I spend almost every day and night reading DD, reports, news, counter-news, and whatnot. I have made a LOT of money on Gamestop, eclipsing my YTD gains on everything else. I‚Äôm still involved in Gamestop.

Cramer, hear this: Your article is entirely missing the point of why we are mad at you. You never once stopped to think about why we would be so upset with you. You‚Äôre just mad that we‚Äôre mad and you have to deal with all this like it‚Äôs some sort of great, undeserving inconvenience for you. You absolutely do deserve some of the hatred you are receiving. Of course, the internet always takes things too far, but one thing you should always keep in mind when you are on the receiving end of ire like this is realizing that MAYBE, just MAYBE you actually did something wrong. You are not the victim here. You are a perpetrator, whether you think so or not. I will explain this thoroughly if you give me a chance.

First of all, let me address your history. It was interesting and I applaud you for coming from nothing. That‚Äôs a true WSB success story. Except for the parts where you go balls deep into hedge fund culture. I get that stock investment was dramatically different back then and that‚Äôs just how things were done, but I think you ought to accept that being so entrenched in hedge fund culture has given you a world view that is completely disparate from the retail trader. You are a monumentally famous person in the stock space. One could argue you are the single most famous trader in the market. Everyone in this space knows you and even those that don‚Äôt trade stocks at all know you. Not only that, but you have regular access to speaking with and being influenced by some of the biggest names in the world. Hedge funds, businesses, politicians, analysts. People we never, ever get to speak to. You pander to most of these people. Sometimes you go against them, but it‚Äôs quite rare and usually short lived. I imagine you do this because you want them as returning guests. When it comes to Gamestop, you‚Äôre so far gone, that we have reached where we are today with our feelings towards you. Again, I will explain this soon. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that you need to accept that your status in this world has shaped you, whether you accept that or not. You are not one of us anymore, even if you think you are. You have probably been rich longer than you were poor and while I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you truly *believe* you are trying to help the everyman, I don‚Äôt think you understand the power of the position you are in.

Now let‚Äôs get to Gamestop. You, of all people, have the power to open this can of worms up to the world. That‚Äôs what an everyman would do. Someone who wanted more people to live in houses and not cars. Instead, you are trying to give hedge funds an out in this trade that many are invested in. Do you understand how that would absolutely devastate retail traders? Gamestop knows what they are doing. Cohen knows what he is doing. All you are doing is showing that you are not on our side. You say you haven‚Äôt spoken to hedge funds about shilling their out, and I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt on that, but that doesn‚Äôt make you any less of a shill for it. You spread all this FUD about Gamestop, but you don‚Äôt even *mention* any of the evidence we‚Äôve accumulated against hedge funds in their tactics. Or you scoff at it like we are a bunch of braindead idiots. This makes you sound like a shill.

You claim to read WallstreetBets often and yet, not once have you ever attacked hedge funds for their use of blatant short attacks. Not once have you mentioned how silver was never a Reddit stock. Not once have you mentioned that MarketWatch released an article, confirmed by both E-Trade and WeBull timestamps, saying Gamestop would crash BEFORE it crashed. Not once have you been on our side about Robinhood‚Äôs involvement in manipulating the market. Not once have you sided with the everyman and yet you say you are still that guy living in his car. No, you‚Äôre not. You really, really are not.

This is what you are: You‚Äôre either too afraid to speak up or are a narcissist. Either are highly probable given the kind of people who make it into positions like you. You are entering your retirement years, Jim. You have more money than you could possibly know what to do with. You are completely capable of turning the Gamestop story into nationwide news and putting your reputation on the line for this. Whether or not it panned out, and let‚Äôs assume hedge funds manage to cover this story up with 100% success, the people would be on your side for eternity. We know hedge funds are going too far and we found a trade that milks them for everything they‚Äôre worth. Be on our side in this. You are not on the right side and you will continue to see the ire of the people because of it.

We like the stock. We like the fundamentals. This trade is justifiable based on our DD and the level of sheer and obvious market manipulation the hedge funds will go to keep the trade from reaching its zenith. Jim Cramer, you are wrong. 100% wrong. So wrong that we are angry with you. Incredibly, incredible angry with you. I‚Äôm being a bit repetitive with this, but I‚Äôm doing so to reiterate how strongly we feel about it. You are on the wrong side of history and you are on the wrong side of humanity. You need to take a good hard look in the mirror and think about what you want the end of your legacy to be. Do you want to be the guy who will be remembered for explaining how hedge funds manipulate markets or do you want to use that knowledge to actually take action against the institutions who are actively trying to make more people live in their car? This is your test as a human, Jim. You‚Äôve accumulated so much money for yourself and frankly, hedge funds, more than regular people. Just because you donate money here and there doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a good person. You could literally be doing it for the tax benefits and pretending it‚Äôs for a good cause. This is the same BS we hear from just about every other mega rich person, so don‚Äôt give us that crap. We need a fair market and it‚Äôs blatantly clear the hedge funds are not using fair tactics. Not only that, they are using illegal tactics. And our legislators have no clue what to do because they themselves are NOT traders. You could seriously change the landscape of the market and help them write fairer legislation.

If you want, I offer my services as an expert on this topic. I will literally fly and meet you, on my own dime, and brief you on everything that has gone on during the Gamestop rally. I will lay out all the evidence for you. Not of the metrics and value of the play, but of the unfair/illegal market tactics that have gone on to keep the play from happening at all. But, I will only do this if you promise to take a stand. I don‚Äôt want to waste my money and time on someone who has no intention of helping improve the system. Use your power for good. Maybe you don‚Äôt change anything, but maybe you change *everything.*

There‚Äôs nothing more honorable than admitting you were wrong and doing something about it afterwards. If the world had more people who could do that, we‚Äôd live in a much better place. And I guarantee if you stood on our side, you‚Äôd see that the 99% hate turned to 99% love.

290 Institutional holders in RKT.

84,031,333 Shares Held by them.

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence:  

\- Rock Founder Dan Gilbert is petty - [evidence Lebron James letter](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5365704)

\- CEO Jay Farner has made clear they are fed up with shorts keeping the stock down.  Has declared on television ""[This is not a company you want to be short](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)"" and also stated that $43 a share undervalues the company.

\- Company announced $1 bn stock buyback plan as well as $1.11 special dividend.  Possibly in an attempt to gain valuable institutional holders and also an attempt to ward of shorts.  

\- RKT is aggressively spending to gain market share and has an ambitious goal to achieve 25% market share by 2030.  (Had 5% share in 2019 and 8% as of Q3 2020.)

\- A 25% market share growth cannot be accomplished organically.  With that, I would believe RKT has significant interest in making sure the stock price is stable and healthy.  This however, cannot be accomplished if shorts continue to dictate the stock price as they have been.  

\- If you are familiar with Dan Gilbert's background, how he's revitalized Detroit, how he's a big forward and abstract thinker, (saw an interview of him jerking off Steve Jobs), and how RKT keeps trying to compare themselves to being built in a similar fashion to what Bezos did, let alone all the media sympathy the guy gets for having a stroke - you would have to believe they are laser focused on accomplishing any goals they set.  

&amp;#x200B;

Theory: 

To me, it seems the company is intent on making clear to short sellers that they need to move on to other targets.  I feel like the best opportunity to do that will be around 3/23.

If the top 6 investment managers holding RKT happen to be reinvesting their dividends, that would be 43.3mn shares and so creating upward pressure of $48.1mn on 3/23.  (To add, their top holders are Invesco, Blackrock and Vanguard - it doesn't get better than that.)

With that buying pressure, accompanied by an initiation of the stock buyback, and now that we know RKT can gain momentum, I would hypothesize that would be good enough to cause a gamma or short squeeze large enough to get the stock into the $50s.

Basically, I'm bullish on seeing the stock pop just because the company wants a short squeeze and it looks like it's quasi-meme stock that people want to run up.  Then again, i have no idea what i'm talking about.  Just hoping for a moon here.",3/23 RKT Special Dividend Reinvested - Upward Pressure?,1.0,1615771601,mrbrownmagic
