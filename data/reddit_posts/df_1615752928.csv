13,m53bgl,"There is an outstanding 1 million shares(260 million$ at 260 share, which is 1% of total losses, followed by 1% of daily losses) at a .8% interest rate,  2,080,000 interest/day that will be available on next market open / premarket. The dip we saw last week of 346 -&gt; 180? That is very likely to happen again if a bull run occurs on monday, or just to throw the price down to push it from putting calls ITM, for the week and to profit off sold OTM calls. 

Be prepared, if you plan to buy, wait for the crash(it will be larger than a dip.) Apes be warned. If this doesn't occur, it means they are banking to cause a stock freefall, which means on tuesday, or wednesday at the latest they will go all in to attempt to trigger every last stop loss, and ape paper hands as a last ditch effort to avoid covering. They are down close to 22.5b(at the bare minimum), and unlike us can afford to lose much, much more. And will do anything not to get called upon to cover the shares, or get margin called with a high stock increase EoD. Imagine trying to cover 10-15m\~ shares at 260 price, and for every 1 mil shares you cover, you cause the price to jump 150$, increasing exponentially the faster you buy. 100k/share would not be a meme if they were forced to cover, because of how hard and fast the price would spike due to the low demand, and high buy volume that would have to occur.

They can keep up these short attacks longer than people seem to think the squeeze could be 3 months away, it could be 3 days. But remember this, if they are caught they are facing consequences worse than anything they have seen before. The entire FUD campaign will continue, it will not end and may even intensify. The people doing this have no ethics and qualms about forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of work remember? Hell they probably even have quite a few shares put into the long position, just to offset losses, this is a long term commitment.

Much of what I‚Äôve learned has been from DD posts here and Investopedia so if I was raised by idiots, don‚Äôt be surprised when I‚Äôm an idiot.

[S&amp;P Global claims that GME SI% dropped from 132% to 46% between Feb 8th and Feb 16th.](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063) This is a change in SI% of 86%. From what I could gather from GME‚Äôs chart during that time frame, the total volume for that whole time was only 34,732,320.00 which is only 64% of the total float. 

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/5HVRZ8W.png)

[Numbers](https://i.imgur.com/ENCj4Uk.png)

From how I understand, it would be impossible to bring the SI% down 86% of float if not that many shares total were moved (even if 100% of trades were covering short positions (which we know was not the case)). Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding something about the way volume and SI% works?

Do these numbers definitively prove that S&amp;P Global is lying about SI% or are there other factors that I‚Äôm ignorant of?",Do these numbers concretely prove S&amp;P Global lied about GME‚Äôs SI%?,1.0,1615753380,SecretlyReformed

It should be obvious, but some people can hold $GME with üíéü§≤ while also making charitable donations. Personally, I'm impressed with the power that a group of like-minded individuals has when working together. The amount of money that many of these organizations in need have received in a short span of time is amazing! 

The same energy that is being put towards charity at the moment is the same energy that is behind the conviction for $GME. That is a good thing! We're all a part of a strong community.

I understand that this journey can be emotionally charged at times, and any small deviation from the core tennet of holding with üíéü§≤ may seem like an unnecessary distraction. I'd just like to encourage you to realize that in the end, we all want the same damn thing. 

I'm a blue collar worker. I make a reasonable living and have been fortunate to have job stability for many years, even throughout the pandemic. My eyes are open to the fact that there are many people who haven't been as fortunate as myself, and many others who have had it a lot better than me. I don't have enough money to buy a lot of shares but I've been accumulating shares during dips and have no intention of selling until the MOASS takes us to unlimited banana-land. üçåüçåüçåüçå

That being said, if some people have the ability to make donations, great! You need to realize this likely isn't an either/or situation for them. Those same people who are donating money probably don't have to sell any shares to free up capital to do so. 

I hold for my family, both here and at home. The potential to change my financial situation and the opportunities it would provide is what I remind myself of when I read any uninformed or negative criticisms of the current situation we find ourselves in.

I am 73 and wear hearing aids.  I have noticed many people my age need them, but find them too expensive, so they do without.  I have learned to identify people who have or need hearing aids, because most speak louder because they do not hear their own voices very well.  It is unfortunate, but the cost of hearing aids is typically not covered by regular medical insurance nor Medicare unless it is from a medical injury.  If INND gets a good, reasonable set on the market, it will be huge for people who need them.  This is why I have invested in INND.  I see a huge niche they need to fill for many who really need an affordable set of hearing aids.  Mine cost nearly $4,000 and they are easy to lose (I know from experience).  The Bluetooth ones I have work fantastic for phone calls because I hear great and do not have to press the phone hard to my ear to hear.  I hope INND does well to serve those in desperate need of a valuable piece of medical equipment.  As a side note, loss of hearing affects many people socially because they tend to be less social because they can't hear and it is embarrassing to keep asking people to speak louder or repeat themselves.  They tend to avoid social gatherings because of their loss of hearing.  When we can't hear, most of the time we just smile and nod our heads.  Again, this is why I invested in INND... I think they can be successful with a great product and it will be helpful to those who desperately need something like this to improve their lives.

TLDR: ATNF has crazy short-term (squeeze) and long-term potential.

Updates since my last post:  
* There were no shares left to short on 3/12 and a short volume ratio of [22.85](https://fintel.io/ss/us/atnf).  
* ATNF started at $4.10 and ended at $6.38 last week. Lots of growth but nowhere near the ceiling (IMO)  
 
Some more information and possible catalysts:  
* ATNF will be presenting at the [Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/180-life-sciences-corp-present-183000057.html) on the 17th-18th  
* The [FINRA Short Interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) report comes soon, which could show many shorts have covered or doubled down.  
* A more in-depth [DD](https://old.reddit.com/user/Stocksunfiltered/comments/le76ou/atnf_180_life_sciences_super_low_float_massive/) I found while doing research. Take a look if you're curious about the long potential.
