What are rare earth elements, and why are they important? | American Geosciences Institute
https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/what-are-rare-earth-elements-and-why-are-they-important

Canada has some of the largest known reserves and resources (measured and indicated) of rare earths in the world, estimated at over 15 million tonnes of rare earth oxides.

https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts/20522

 U.S. President Donald Trump on October  signed an executive order declaring a national emergency in the mining industry, aimed at boosting domestic production of rare earth minerals critical for military technologies while reducing the country’s dependence on China.

 “This is the kind of area where the U.S. government will shoot a fire hose of money at a problem, and I’m always standing by with a bucket when that happens,”

56,m3ovwr,"Good afternoon,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a regular run of the mill guy. I make a livable salary and invest on the side, historically in things I believe to be safe or the way of the future, a long term value investor.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, which I believe to be the realistic one, it is impossible to say how this GME saga will play out, as there could be all sorts of fuckery from the people with big money to bend the rules and weasel out of their position. The DD does however lead me to believe that the people in large short positions are very compromised, bleeding and on the verge of death, throwing their limbs viciously about in a last ditch effort to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, it is somewhat unnerving to see a large (to me) sum of money wrapped up in such a volatile commodity, but after consideration as to the situation at hand, I have decided to hold for the foreseeable future. Let me explain my rationale, in the two scenarios that I consider are likely to unfold.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Shorts r fuk

In this future, shorts really are bleeding and crawling towards their final resting spot. Big money longs and retail beats big money shorts, and the price of GME shoots up to unprecedented heights as the DTCC is forced to margin call the shorts and buy up shares at an alarming rate. Being a shareholder of GME myself, I stand to benefit largely from this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Ryan Cohen carries GME to the future as the pillar of gaming e-commerce

In this future, big money shorts and shorts of all kinds escape with huge losses, but with enough liquidity to hold their Wall Street offices. Ryan Cohen and his new crew at GameStop transform the once brick and mortar company to the future over the next 1-5 years, increasing the value of the company and making it a smart long term investment for fans of the gaming and e-commerce sectors alike.

&amp;#x200B;

In both of these scenarios (which I believe to be the likely outcomes) GME is a good investment. I certainly have experienced some FUD regarding my position at GME, but after removing my emotions form the equation, I now see this as a game of risk vs. reward. I asses my risk as low to medium-low, while I asses my reward as high to astronomically high. I either stand to make a life changing amount of money, or to ""baghold"" shares of a company which I personally think will take the way of the future and become the go to brand for all gaming accessories and components, not to mention games (you can't digitally download a controller, or PC, after all). 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering it all of this, I feel it would be foolish for me to sell now and potentially miss the most money I have ever seen in my life. The DD points to this inevitability, but I have removed the expectation that it will happen / will happen at a certain time, knowing that even if it doesn't, I still have faith in my investment regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I do not encourage people to spend their money in any way, I instead implore them to do their research and invest in what fits their investment interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for me personally, I really, really like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

You’ve noticed **GME hasn’t moved much recently**, and that’s because there are a lot of call options that have been sold and will expire worthless at EOD if the stock price is below the strike price. That’s bad for us. 

**We could turn this into a bit move though.**

There are A LOT of contracts between $250-300. Institutional money will do everything it can to keep GME below that number. Here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/ywcXldc) of call options sold today. 

The thing is, if we can get it above $300 today at close, all these contracts will expire IN THE MONEY...and yes, they will have to buy up 100 shares of GME for every contract. And if they’re covered, they will have to sell the shares they are in control of, giving us more leverage and control of more shares. 

For example, just today, there are about 40,000 call options sold between strike price $260-300. 

**So if those close ITM, that’s an extra FOUR MILLION shares of GME that move in our direction.**

So, it’s time, right now. Load up all the extra dry powder to got to push this thing past $300 and keep it there today. 

If you currently own call options ITM you could also exercise them to have the same effect. It’s an important move today that will help us with the bigger squeeze squozing.
