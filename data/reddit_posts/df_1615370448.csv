This along with a fair value around 20% higher than the current price of around $23.03 means price could go to $28.73. Enjoy them tendies. 

Key reasons for optimism include:  

Covid vaccines combined with government stimulus should boost the demand for natural gas and oil. 

They are buying power from solar projects on their way to running 25% on renewables. This is good for a power company because if the price of energy rises - their revenue increases but their cost base (at least the portion powered by solar) stays steady.

66,m1uh2z,"Can I be honest for a moment, as a new investor I bought into GME at $95 early February after the initial craze and finding the WSB community. Every day WSB was filled with thousands of apes hyping each other up and it gave me confidence to invest even if it was trending down. 

A week later WSB had suddenly changed, the former apes that roamed the halls were gone and in it's place was the ""original"" WSB community complaining about the reddit changing. I don't know if the mods were behind it but there wasn't a single positive post about GME after. It was if GME never existed.

As the stock steadily went down then tread water around $40-50 for the next few weeks and compounded with the community to hold confidence no where to be found i felt no need to hold on and cut my losses to invest in other things. 

Now suddenly in the past couple of weeks everything is back to the way it was and the stock is soaring, luckily I got in again at $95 (on the way up this time) already gaining back what I initially lost. But I can't help but ask what the hell happened to WSB? I would have held on and averaged down a few times a week during February if it didn't seem like the community had abandoned the stock.

I am so retarded I don't even check the price. I bought my gme through EToro. Not the best not worst. Okay now that you know me, here's my question.

Etoro doesn't have commissions which is nice. But one way that they make money is by lending stocks to shorter. That means that even if I hold, in practical terms my stocks can be shorted. Now this question unveils how retarded I am, but couldn't this potentially fuck us? Even if we hold they can potentially short multiple times our own shares. What am I missing?

90,m1ukkl,"As GME continues to rise day after day, we creep closer and closer to the all-time high of $483. Heading into the high 200s, new buyers need to make sure they are willing to lose what they are risking, since approaching the $483 mark means a lot of people will be getting ready to sell their hands which were bought above $300, especially above $400. Basically, a lot of people currently DEEP in the red are going to be keen to just abort mission and recover most/all the money they lost. There's going to be a lot of people who thought they had made the worst trade in their life, and any sort of way out will be snatched up immediately, given the SP; 

1. is high enough to offer a decent enough percentage of their loss returned to them, and

2. appears to hit any sort of peak/resistance once over the $300 mark

I believe the SP will creep towards the $300 and start to encounter a lot of resistance. I see the possibility of a $350 peak, before a very abrupt downfall as people in the red see their chances of escape fading, so they cut their losses. This sudden increase in sellers will make recent buyers (since late Feb surge) sense danger. Anybody who was lucky enough to buy sub 100 through Feb will likely see an end to their run and will bail with generous profits. That also includes anybody who bought over $100 who fear their gains may suddenly turn into losses. 

This will cause the SP to plummet suddenly, before a huge amount of buyers jump in, believing they have now managed to enter in at bargain price. This will cause another spike, and will likely bring a lot of sellers back into the mix who sold out of fear, causing the SP to rise very suddenly once again, before slowing back down heading towards the predicted Judgement Day (March 19th). Who knows what will happen then.

So what should you do? If you are thinking of buying in, be ready for some chaos, and be ready to lose what you are risking (that should always go without saying). If you have bought already, be prepared to hold throughout the initial dip that (I believe) will come soon. Selling during the dip will only add fuel to the fire, and you'll be rewarded if you stay.
