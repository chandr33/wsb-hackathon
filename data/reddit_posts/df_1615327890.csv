3,m1ht1i," Everything just came together in a glorious trainwreck in my retarded ape brain.

Ive been seeing these bots on Webull holding up these sell walls starting .02 cents above market value and moving up a penny at a time to about .08 cents above market. So These orders move and stay in the same positition above market value no matter what the price or how fast it moves. I have seen that every so often one of these sells go through. FUCKING LAG!

So if im right about this, this means Hedgie is accumulating shares here and there. I have seen this in other markets im able to watch closely although webull is where im watching the most since its where im trading.

I have also seen some extremely large buy orders go through that my gut tells me are Hedgie buys. 10-20k shares at a time.

So what I am getting at here is that Ive seen things all over the market that suggest to me that Hedgie short seller is actually buying shares right now, but its not enough to come close to covering their shorts. So what would Hedgie want to do with these stacks of shares?

Well earnings report are tomorrow. Now I dont know what time the info is going to be released. But what I expect is Hedgie is going to let the market go at open tomorrow, and where ever we move the price we move the price. So that their is hype, then when earnings come out they are going to dump as hard as they can and drop that price with a dive that looks like a crash. First off it wont crash, If they had they selling power to crash it they would crash it to cover their shorts right? But its going to dip very hard and fast. The 1m chart is going to shake every paper handed retard around. and cause a further dip.

IF THIS GOES DOWN LIKE THIS (because this is just a thought)

BUT IF IT GOES DOWN LIKE THIS LISTEN UP!

This will be the moment of truth. YOU MUST REMAIN RESLIENT If #DiamondsHands is just a hash tag to you, you will probably be out when this happens and probably at a loss too. ITS NOT A LOSS IF YOU HOLD. Our best move if this goes down, is to double down and #BuyTheDip like you have never bought the fucking dip before. My gut is telling me 7.50ish low, possible 6.50 depending on how many paper hands been front like diamond hands.

If you get shook at this point this was all for naught. This will be a last ditch effort for them to win this war. If you sell you could drop the price low enough for hedgie to start buying back short positions. That would be disastrous. YOU CANNOT FUCKING SELL HERE. If this is going to shake you please get out before the announcement, take your profits and run. Its 11.60 as I write this. Take a sweet profit and let us hold those shares for you.

Again if this goes down. REAL investors are going to see AMC's earnings and if the loss isnt terrible it will attract organic investors getting ready to make some money off this squeeze and long term off reopenings. So long as earnings are at less of a loss than Q2 &amp; Q3 We will be good. This is expected. The real activity that will come behind the announcements will boost the price up. This whole thing could play out in 30 min to an hour, or over the course of a few hours.

Real Diamond Hands players will understand this, real investors are going to see through this bullshit, THIS IS MEANT TO SHAKE YOU, yeah you reading this and those apes who dont. Our only play to beat this is to hold that shit like youve never held before. You are on the outside of the rocket hanging on to handle bars breaking the atmosphere at this point, what you are feeling is the last bit of resistance. Secondary play is to when this dip happens to buy as much as you fucking can, this our chance to make our position infinitely stronger by doubling down on their last ditch effort.

I have planed to set a buy for 100 more shares in the 7.60 cent range.

If im right im right, if im wrong i dont need more shares than I already have to change my life in the short squeeze. But the take away is dont get shook if this scenario plays out or anything similar.

One thing im certain of is you can expect negative press about the earnings no matter what they actually are. and you can expect the bot swarm to buzz that negative press all over the place. be ready to combat this and educate people about why amc is not going to report a profit.

Anyway If you stuck through my retarded ramblings I hope this helps you better prepare for a possible negative price reaction to the earnings report. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just the ramblings of a retarded coin investor who got attracted to this whole thing smelling hedgie blood in the water like a shark. I just wanted to drink their tears and laugh never expected to make money. Now that this is playing out I see we have a potential here like there has never been before.

They've also had insane growth due to covid and a relatively dedicated base. I personally know many who play the game and they enjoy it quite a bit. This tells me that this could be a really good long hold. To place emphasis on that point the game was only worth 4 billion at the start of 2020 and has skyrocketed to its current price.

Also, I've personally had great experiences with IPOs most recently with PLTR so I'm planning on buying this one as soon as they release it. 

Circling back to the covid statement, I don't plan on holding this past the virus. Much of its success is due to this. Though if everyone jumps on board we'll see.

Personally, I believe 4 stocks are going to be huge plays. Full disclosure, I've already invested in them near the bottom of the bounce back, but I know a lot more is coming.

TQQQ - Triple the Nasdaq. Leveraged ETFs are risky, yes, but if Tech is bouncing back, then this is going to be a super big bounce back for TQQQ.

URTY - Triple the Russel 2000. Small businesses are going to be back as COVID disappears. Last year was the year for COVID stocks, and this is the year for small businesses.

ABNB - COVID will go away and people will travel much more. The real big difference for Airbnb this year versus prior years will be the corporate users. Companies are much more flexible on their work from home policies, and will be in the future because of how COVID changed everything. People will be able to work from anywhere.

SQ - Square. With in-person shopping on the rise this year, Square will become super important. One of the most innovative companies out there.

Nanox Imaging is looking to revolutionize the medical imaging industry. They are currently waiting on FDA approval for a portion of their technology map. The technology has already been pre-approved by a third-party reviewer that the FDA uses to fast-track the process. The stock has seen much higher highs than its current valuation, and has recently fallen from grace with the rest of tech. From my following of the FDA review timeline, it will most likely be approved within the next two weeks and after that I imagine it will we‚Äôll eclipse its ATHs.

Hey apes, I want to have a chat about something.¬† I know we‚Äôre making history every day, and that trend will continue until we‚Äôre enjoying tendies on the moon.¬†
¬†
What I want to talk about is how we share our tendies and make banana for more apes.¬† Food banks are a great place to create momentary security for folks that need it, but you know what would be better?¬† If we combined forces and focused on developing ways to create food security that keep producing.
¬†
It‚Äôs great to give back to folks that need it, especially in the short-term.¬† However, there will always be hungry people in need of immediate assistance, so why not use our tendies to create as much abundance and security as possible?¬† I‚Äôm working with folks on the Hopi reservation and a couple of nonprofits to get a geo-thermal greenhouse constructed in the next couple of months, and we plan on building more to create food security up there.
¬†
Down the road, we even want to build rent-free eco-villages and be able to house people and families for free and feed them for free, as the space to do so becomes available.¬† I encourage everyone that is hesitant of my and my team's intentions to check my post history to see we're taking action.  If we are going to use our gains to try and make a difference, it seems important to try and collaborate and use what we have to make the biggest possible positive impact.¬† A team of people and I are pursuing these very things with the resources we have available, and it‚Äôs slow going but we are making progress.¬† There is more value in creating more security for more people, and the smoothest brains in this sub can understand that more people housed and less people hungry makes the world better.
¬†
If you want to personally get involved with these projects or learn more, shoot me a message or follow my profile and keep an eye out for updates.¬† The ability to bail the world out of so many issues is about to be placed in our ape hands, and we don‚Äôt have to stop at the moon.¬† ¬†With great tendies comes great responsibility, and the people that the hedgies have fucked for generations now don‚Äôt have to lose their homes or go hungry over getting screwed out of seeking security.¬† Apes together strong, 2 banana better than 1, and we can fix a lot more with what‚Äôs coming than what many of us initially imagined.¬†¬†","With great tendies comes great responsibility, but how do us apes best use what's coming?",1.0,1615328766,hlfempty69

Or is this a way for the market to be controlled even further by billionares?

Even Robinhood limits you to 5 trades per week IF and only IF, your securities amount to less than $25,000.

I understand some people were complaining about losing money, hence the intense regulations.

But that has nothing to do with the efficacy of a brokerage firm/app, and more to do with the emotional intelligence of the individual.

And I don't see how this affects poor people all that much. If a share cost $5, like AMC, and I could only afford 3 shares, well right now, with it being at $11, I just made $18 in profits. And it will rarely go below $5.

Not only that, but if you have Webull set to 1Tick in the intervals, you will see insane spikes, that only last a few couple of seconds. (Which means they are not visible under 1Minute intervals.

AMC climbed to $19 literally for just a few seconds, an hour ago.


So if a person was serious on Day-Trading, and had multiple monitors with all of them on 1Ticks, wouldn't you be making a lot of money starting off, if there weren't any limitations?

This kind of strategy would only benefit poor ~ middle class people, because billionares either already have good Roth IRA's, Mutual Funds, or other forms of automatically making a LOT more money, without working for it.


So in essence, I think this limitation is a huge FUCK-YOU, GO AWAY for anyone trying to actually get seriously started in the Stock Market with little cash.

I see a lot of people talking about GME like the company is failing because it‚Äôs being shorted, but isn‚Äôt it the other way around? I‚Äôm not super financially literate but it seems the amount of shorting with GameStop is reckless because it creates a ton of fragility. A short seller is lent a stock which is lent to a short seller which is lent over and over so you wind up with a lot of money riding on not a lot of shares and a ridiculous short interest.
