14,m6yz9u,"Last night whilst sleeping in my straw laden nest; I had a dream that I held 1,000 shares in GME and the MOASS was in full rope tyre-swing. I woke up sodden in sweat and my heart racing only to find my wife was pregnant. This wouldn’t be strange but we’ve never consummated our marriage.  Our vicar who is a rather handsome chap and rides a Harley has remained very good friends with us since the wedding, helping my wife with shopping and tennis lessons, and even joined us on our honeymoon; said it can only be an immaculate conception brought on by the miracle that is GME......",Immaculate conception GME,1.0,1615982990,thomasbe123
15,m6yzbv,"On Paddy's day I think it is vitally important for us to stop and ponder the real possibility that the ghost of St. Patrick himself is helping us in our war against the hedgies. 

Let's look at some FACTS:

1. Just like WSB users, the Irish were long looked at as the apes of Europe by wealthier nations. [Proof](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/TheUsualIrishWayofDoingThings_%28cr%29.jpg)

2. Originally kidnapped and brought to Ireland before gaining his freedom, Saint Patrick returned to help the Irish apes from Wales, a term commonly used to describe mega wealthy investors or investor groups. [A BBC news story about a whale sighting off the coast of Wales.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-49815113)

3. He banished the snakes from ireland, just like how WSB wants to banish the shnakey actions of the hedgefunds from the stock exchanges of the world. [Recently discovered artists impression of St. Patrick](https://imgur.com/gallery/AxpdjpI)

4. As St. Patrick lived in the pre-electricfication era its safe to assume that he used CANDLES, we can also hypothesise that GREEN was his favourite colour based on his association with the colour. What does this mean? One thing; Saint Patrick was enamoured with GREEN CANDLES. [Another famous artwork of St. Patrick, notice anything?](https://imgur.com/gallery/zSxntIC)

Conclusion: It is clearly evident that the Ghost of Saint Patrick has returned yet again from Wales to banish the snakes and bring green candles for all his apes.

Bonus bet: It is commonly believed that he flourished in the 5th century and died March 17th 461CE. If the stock reaches 461$ EOW I will record myself dressed as Saint Patrick throwing jelly snakes into the sea while eating a green candle.",A theory on why the ghost of Saint Patrick is helping us.,1.0,1615982996,Lord_Cabbage_the_5th

Hello apes. Before calling me a Cramer cronie or a shill bot - I am in on GME. I like the stock and will not sell until it reaches at least $42069. Obligatory 🚀🚀

Now to the meat: 

Detroit news published an article advising that UWMC ‘missed 80% of their brokers’. Meaning that by the addendum ultimatum on 15/3 they did not reach their target. Nevertheless, here is a breakdown as per the source about how many brokers are on board/declined/have yet to respond.

“The 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.”

And:

“Not responding doesn’t mean they didn’t commit — we’re still in communication with those who haven’t accepted or some clients are out of town, and it would be a vastly poor assumption to think that all those who have yet to accept won’t accept,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""

Source: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/03/16/united-wholesale-mortgage-misses-broker-goal-feud-rocket-mortgage-fairway-independent/4715422001/


TL;DR: 65% of independent brokers are confirmed with signing the deal. 1200 have yet to decide but CEO believe more than 50% will (seems reasonable).

**G**ood **M**orning **E**veryone 🦍🌚

Yesterday was an great day. Probably most of you are asking now wtf is he talking about? GME lost more than 20 Points. Well technicaly yes, but as No: It was an unnatural drop from 232$ to 172$ which depleted the resources of the HFers, we should see some upward movement with a bit of turbulence the next days.

*HODL THE LINE I ❤️ YOU**
Once we have hitted our diamond support at 172$, most of you Apes did **[BUY THE FKN DIP](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie)** and I love you therefore!

**SSR**
I know, we described this thing 100 of times. It’s just for the new folks here. It means Short Selling Restrictions, which prohibits selling shorts at an lower price than the current market buy price. This “should” prevent the stock from dropping too much and is triggered for one day, if the stock has deprecated more than 10% in value! And SSR are now up since last Thursday.

**How come we still see those unnatural drops**
Well as you now the HedgeFukers are dirty tricking basterds. They are buying every day tons of Long Positions and placing massive sell orders once their long positions hit an target. It seems they have built up an massive sell wall of those long positions at 220$ and 250$. 

**Pre-Market Update 1:** 
Germany is quiet, not too much movement, too quiet. As we know from history every moment before the great battle, has quiet surroundings as fuk. GME started at 215$ and lost 13$ in the Pre-Market, the price is hovering an bit over the significant 200$ line. Shorts borrowing fee is at an record low with 0.7%, this suggests that the Shitters have reserved the right for very much shorting positions, which we apparently cannot see.

Shorts available: we can only see 400.000

Current Pre-Market Price: 205$

**Yesterday**
Yesterday I’ve done an Apedate on AMC and promised an giveaway if AMC reaches 16$ EOD, which apparently did not happen. Today i would like to make another giveaway, I really want the stocks to go up and gift one Hoodie or T-Shirt to the Community.

*Todays enhanced Giveaway** to the community
Therefore I promise you fellow Apes 🦍, if GME reaches 260$ EOD I’ll donate any of **[THIS HOODIES](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie)** or even **[THIS T-SHIRTS](https://apemerch.com/product/gamestonk-t-shirt)** to the top comment (write Tshirt/Hoodie, your Size + desired Color).

92,m6zj8w,"Had a turtle beach headset for my Xbox for 5 + years. Thing sounded great and was sturdy as a fuckin rock. Even snapped in half once after I accidentally sat on it. Duct taped that bitch back together and used it for another 2 years. 

Well it finally reached the end of its lifecycle in January, so being a reasonable ape who owns CRSR stock I purchased one of the HS60 headsets to support my homies. Sound quality was good and overall I liked it. But when I started playing with some of my friends, they kept telling me they could hear my game sound. Weird. Two nights ago, I finally did a test by completely covering the microphone and pressing the volume up button on my headset in order to cause it to make a little tone to notify that it was at max volume. And yep, everyone heard that loud and clear in my party. So this stupid thing transmits my game sound as voice chat....

So I go to warranty the thing, and it fucking turns out that Corsair doesn’t even do refunds. The best you can get is a replacement after playing some little song and dance with them for shipping (which you also pay for). All of this has to be done directly through Corsair.

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lands-end-crowdstrike-plug-power-more.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

&gt; * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&amp;P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

*****

&gt; # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

&gt; * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

&gt; # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

&gt; * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

&gt; * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

*****

&gt; # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

&gt; * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

&gt; * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

*****

&gt; # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

&gt; * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

AMC- MACD on all charts indicated we will see an immediate spike after premarket opens. This indicates an immediate dip at market open. A very good sign, dips are free tendies on amc.

GME- MACD shows a very healthy recover from yesterday's shitshow. I was bullish on today, but the stimmy and the current direction of MACD, I expect to blast off at premarket, and most likely continue up all day, unless we get hedgies painting the tape all day.

What to watch: RSI ON GME IS VERY HIGH BEFORE PREMARKET. This could be bad, or good. I hope we can keep bouncing off the 70, and stay above, this is going to squeeze them hard as fuck. 

I believe AMC will be attacked today with painting the Hedges, sense we didn't see it yesterday, watch order book. If you see thousands of buy and sell amounts at the same volume such as 61,62,52,53 whatever the number. This will likely be a flat day, and destroy our momentum.
