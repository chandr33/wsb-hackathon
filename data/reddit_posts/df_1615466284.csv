Link to the German GME
https://www.ls-tc.de/en/stock/gamestop-aktie

Retards, autists, and simpletons. Today the Germans saw similar price action on GME that the US did on Mar. 10th. You can see the wonderful bull rip in the early mornings, but from 10:04-10:54 the Euroapes experienced similar pain that we did. 

In 50 minutes, GME dropped from €231-192. That’s $276-229 for our crayon-munching freedom-loving smooth brains. 

I’m not one for conspiracies, but if you tell me that yesterday’s price action was the effect of an efficient and free market then I have several bridges for sale.",GME saw the same short attack hit in the German market today.,1.0,1615466489,Montezumas_re-SENDIT

You apes took out 4x as many options at 300 as there were yesterday. Bearing in mind that yesterday 300 had more options than ANY other pricepoint in the chain. Followed by 800.

Currently the options volume rankings stand at

* 800 - 44,846
* 300 - 36,408
* 400 - 17,204
* 350 - 14,271
* 500 - 13,415
* 250 - 8,922

There are nearly as many call options at 250 as there were at 300 yesterday and just as many in between. If we can keep this price going up and hit some of the bigger volumes its apes to the moon on that sweet sweet gamma.",GME Options today vs yesterday,1.0,1615466528,jpjapers
