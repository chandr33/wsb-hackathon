35,lxy5c4,"You're a 🦍who's hungry for a 🍌. However, thanks to the deforestation around the world (estimated 18.7 million acres are felled each year) gorillas, bonobos, chimpanzees and orangutans don't have any 🍌🌴 to pick their food from. So what's an 🦍gotta do ?!

Emoji Guide: 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 = Market Maker 🦍🦍 = Investors 🍌🍌 = Stocks 🏹🏹 = Brokerage / Market

# Chapter 1:

You round up your pals 🦍🦍🦍 and you head to the 🏹🏹 market so you can buy some 🍌🍌🍌from the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾.

The 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 set the price for the 🍌🍌. In order for the 🏹🏹 market to be able to meet the demand of the 🦍🦍 there needs to be liquidity so that any 🦍🦍is capable of buying a 🍌🍌 as they please. Consider if you wanted to sell your house, it's not likely that you would be able to sell it instantly. In terms of the equity markets, this is where 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 play a role. In order to be able to buy or sell 🍌🍌someone has to be on the other side of that deal. 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾around the globe provide liquidity on all of the major exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, Japan Exchange Group, etc.)

# Chapter 2

So you want to buy 100 🍌🍌 and you'll notice there is a bid price and an ask price.

🍌🍌bid = $10

🍌🍌ask = $12

spread = $2

For the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 the bid of $10 is what they BUY the 🍌🍌for and $12 is what they SELL the 🍌🍌 to 🦍🦍for.

Now we all know that 🦍🦍have 💎👐 but let's say that the price of 🍌🍌have gone up to $420.69 and you'd like to sell some of those 🍌🍌. Well the price that you sell for will be the bid price for the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 and if some more 🦍🦍 come along and want to buy those $420.69 🍌🍌 the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾will sell those to the new 🦍🦍 at the ask price. So let's simplify this and get rid of the $420.69 price and use the original numbers of $10 and $12.

# Chapter 3

🦍🦍 buys 🍌🍌 from the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 at the ask price of $12.

🙉 makes a mistake and sells 🍌🍌 to the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 for $10.

🦧 comes along and buys the 🍌🍌 that the 🙉🧻👐mistakenly sold to the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 for $12.

👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 just made $2

🦍+ 🦧 have 💎👐

🙉 has 🧻👐

Now that we understand how Market Makers work, let's take a look at how 🧛 (Vlad) makes money on his brokerage 🏹 (RH).

As you can see below, all of those 🍌🍌that get traded back and forth bring in a lot of revenue for the 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾, who are paying 🧛🏹 for the privilege of being their Market Makers. Given the massive influx of retail investing in the past year, it makes sense that the revenue would be increasing here.

In a nutshell....The 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 are paying 🧛🏹 to be the ones who can profit off of the 🙉 🧻👐.

In the case of 🧛🏹 the Market Maker is 🏰 (Citadel Securities).

Order Flow by Brokerage.

This is a somewhat oversimplification of what happens, but in order to create an easy to understand outline of what is happening, I can't add every single detail of what is happening.

52,lxy8rd,"*This is not financial advice.*

A lot of you BB bulls are worried about the future of BlackBerry, the price goes down and down. But fear not BlackBerry has a very bright future ahead.

Today we had a conference with Morgan Stanley about BlackBerry technology, here are some of the insights from the conference:

1. ⁠Drones confirmed by the Chief technology officer (this is big news) as big application for QNX
2. ⁠Body-language wise didn't seem like the Chief technology officer was worried about semi-conductors
3. ⁠Said that automotive slowed down b/c of covid but made reference to the fact that they were ""coming out of it"" - Feels bullish for next earnings or two
4. ⁠Adhoc (messaging solution) straight up benefitted from COVID. zero hesitation from the Chief technology officer answering that question. This is pretty bullish.

The most important thing about BlackBerry in my opinion is IVY, it is going to be the Microsoft of car. We also have confirmation about how IVY will generate revenue, this will be on a subscription level, almost like Netflix. Instead, it is the car manufacturer who will be paying this subscription fee. So you could almost say IVY is a fusion between Microsoft and Netflix.

**So what is IVY?** Well, a picture describes more than a thousand words:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/if9vl0gsg3l61.jpg?width=2117&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eec7bebf7ba6c214876ebcdde853c268dbb6abf3

**How big is IVY going to be?**

As many of you know QNX is already in 175m cars, what would 175m cars with IVY be worth to BlackBerry? Well, I have created a chart below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9swvq7ktg3l61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f32d9ff10eb1bb1f06ef5519c2f1b1b5c85ad772

This right here would be the case if all cars with QNX had IVY installed, and if the subscription fee is $1 a month. It is very hard to say what the service would cost for the car manufacturer, but my estimate is somewhere around $1-5 a month.

BlackBerry currently has a 61% market share of the EV OEM market, and in 10 years most cars on the road would be EV. In 2019 92m AV and EV cars were produced, that would be around 56m cars installed with IVY if all were EV cars. In 2040 at least 750-1000m cars would have IVY installed if it goes as planned.

This looks very very promising, especially for a company only valued at 6x their current revenue and an MC of $5.5b.

**Price prediction** (my opinion)

As of the stock price, we are currently trading below $10, the latest analyst rating BB received was that a fair valuation is $10 from Canaccord which would make BB a buy at the moment. However, I feel like a fair valuation would be much higher around $50-75 if you take into account the bright future.

**Has BlackBerry caught your attention?**

71,lxyc98,"What do you think will be SNOW's growth and trajectory in the next months, and next year?  
I saw a few posting buying puts pre-earnings, some positive talk but overall little hype except about the lockup end happening on 3/6. So far SNOW is victim of its success with cautious bullishness from analysts, preventing  the market from pushing the stock up like ZM... maybe its growth is a bit more predictable.  


* Quarter results are in, good as expected:  
Q4'20:  
revenue $190M (+117% YoY, beats $178.5M consensus)  
losses -70c/share (vs $-1.67 a year ago, but consensus was an optimistic -17c/share)  
net loss $199M (vs $83M a year ago)  
Q1'21 guidance:  
revenue of $195\~$200M (+92% YoY)  
2021 guidance:  
revenue of $1B\~1.02B (+82% YoY) - is that really too bearish?

Analysts are cautiously optimistic, because the valuation is high but the prospects also very high so it's hard to put a price tag, just like buying a house when the market's hot:  
[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts)  
At $71B market cap/$250 share, and a nearly 2X growth prospect, that's 70X 2021 earnings 35X 2022, 20X 2023... Maybe we can assume growth slows around 5B to 10B aka 10% of TAM.

&amp;#x200B;

* Does the employee lock up really matter ?

Lockup ends this week. The vast majority of the shares are held by VCs, the CEO &amp; founders, etc. the hands of a very few. Those shares will likely never see the market, as they're controlling shares. Original B shares had also 10 voting rights, and needed to be converted to single voting right A shares to trade, but it looks like they're disolving this structure. Will these billionaires sell lots of shares? no. And if they do they'll have to disclose. Snowflake has few employees and they don't hold that many shares so would they really influence the market selling? Also would they sell at $250 lows? Is this deadline just FUD fuel?  


* I like the stock.

I'm personally very bullish on the company's future. I like its culture  and the product, I  trust the founders who've worked hand in hand with the angel investor VCs along the way, and I believe they're passionate about the company and product. IDK about the CEO who was brought in later - because of his track record. There's tons of ex Oracle employees working there who understand the business and the customers (it's a customer centric company).  
For me their product is this : it's a classic SQL OLAP database in the cloud that's elastic, with easy management, which has many plugins to do data mining and AI, and fine controls for sharing securely parts of tables (that's big for security inside a company AND for selling data). It is secure enough to be certified to hold medical (HIPAA) and banking data (CapitalOne!). It's also an ""ACID"" transactional database, and its SQL language superset is rich enough to facilitate migration from other vendors like Terradata, Redshift, Oracle, etc. That'll be key to migrate customers from legacy on-prem solutions to cloud.  
Unfortunately it is not an OLTP database so it can't tap customers sensitive to query latency. It's also likely not the fastest to store and manipulate text like logs, though it can handle large JSON and XML data fine, it shines in columnar data.  
Why it's hot I think is it bring old school SQL to the next century as a compatibility story, where other map-reduce cloud solutions failed to become ubiquitous because it was too hard to migrate.  
The big 3 (AMZ, GOOG, MSFT) provide similar offerings BUT AFAIK, they do so packaging old school on-prem databases into cloud servers, so it's a kludge to make it work and the customer ends up dealing with it when they try to use the scalable ""elastic"" part, aka hiring very skilled DBA engineers. There's a reason SNOW customers like the product, stick there and buy more. It's not just because it's cheaper, it's also easier.  
Databases are the foundations to build on top of, and all businesses need to buy strong foundations, SNOW is such an offering with a few years of lead time vs competition in terms of tech. I believe the addressable market (TAM) is like many 10's or 100's of billions estimated with a handful of big players. ""Big data"" and ""cloud"" have been buzz words since Y2K, but that revolution happening now.  
I have a feeling Snow was at the sweet spot: not too early that it needs to justify why you want to buy the product, and not too late to justify why to use them vs other established vendors. I feel it will be one of the mammoths. :)  


* Why I care?

I am overweight on those shares and I need to decide when to sell &amp; diversify my savings. I still feel Snow might be the next CRM or ORCL growth story, but did it just start too hot? Will it go back to $420 within a few month? How good do the news have to be? I certainly don't feel I want to sell at $250, it feels I could be on a rocket's passenger seat waiting for liftoff and I don't want to miss that... At $350? Hmmm... maybe I'm willing to miss some of the liftoff, and diversify to protect myself if SNOW actually trips :P At $420? I definitely would diversify.  


* Palantir

IDK why there's way more hype on Palantir than snowflake on reddit, and why they're compared so much. Maybe it's PLTR's valuation? What's Palantir's addressable market and its competition? Palantir I feel is more of an end user product to do analytics with custom plumbing behind, but I don't really understand their business  value add and how it's different from say Looker or Tableau, and if Palantir's value add is relevant if the data is in a database format compatible with standard tools, which should be the case for most non-gov customers.",Where is SNOW heading?,0.56,1614900202,AmenophisCat

81,lxydkh," 

I want to clarify the positive as well as the negative things. I Think we have the opportunity to buy OCGN and let all people know that we want a conservative Vaccine!

positive reasons:

\- Huge Short Interest !

\- Intermediate analysis -&gt; 81% efficient against Covid-19 and the mutations (intermediate analysis mostly shows lower efficiency than the end result, maybe it will be over 88%)

\-Also adolescents between 12 and 16 can vaccinate themselves with it (population of USA = 330 million, consider how many of them are between 12-16, as far as I know about 45 million people)

\-Storage and delivery at 2 - 8 ° C (it couldn't be more perfect!)

\-Covaxin is patented in the name of OCGN and OCGN gets 45% profit margin in the US market

\-Ocugen and Bharat Biotech will deliver this vaccine to many countries (Brazil, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, France, Spain etc.) with an FDA approval, that is to say almost 1.5 billion people with a part of India itself!

\- Vaccine costs around $ 4 in India that means in the US it will cost around $ 6-8 (very interesting for the government)

\-Due to the way Covaxin is made, demand will grow massively and Covaxin can and will be the best vaccine in the world.

\-CAUTION: Ocugen co-developed the vaccine with Bharat Biotech! That means that it is not just 45% only in the US market. In the future, Bharat Biotech will certainly enter into more partnerships with OCGN!

\-OCGN400 phase 1 starts soon!

Negative reasons:

\-MRNA, Biotech &amp; J&amp;J already have a vaccine (but they can't save the whole world and what's more, the way it is made is brand new! And Covaxin is based on the old way of making vaccines)

\- Approval takes time until mid-April at the latest

The positive reasons weigh more on the scales than the negative, and OCGN is extremely undervalued. I'll keep my shares and wait until it's over $ 80. Why? Take a look at the company ""Curevac""! it has nothing in hand and the market cap is at 15 billion.

Hello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up:

Just recently one particular post/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. 

Yes but....WRONG! 

I don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you:

(Translated from german Wikipedia):

""An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. [1] On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.""

In Short:

Porsche had 74,1%

Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony - 😂😂), a ""state"" of Germany had 20%

So the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. 

What's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: 

There are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price/planned sell price/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. 

Thats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. 

To give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. 

However I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$

Since I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock!

...Made 5k€ at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100€ 💎🙌🚀

... Please correct me if I am totally wrong here.","GME vs VW Squeeze, NOT THE SAME! But I also like the stock 🙌💎🚀",0.57,1614900441,Robin_Squeeze
