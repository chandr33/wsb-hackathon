Despite the fact that I am really happy for all you apes that are making a shitload of money with RKT right now.... Is there any Chance that these HF and their bots and face accounts are pushing RKT here, just go get people away from GME and make a lot of money in the process?

Since I am way to retarded to do it, can anybody here do some real DD and check if Melvin and Co. are maybe making money out of RKT? Or are they super retarded and shorting this, too?

RKT was at a 40B market cap just a couple days ago, the fact that it has managed to go up 75% is fucking *crazy* and way more impressive than GME's similar spike up (it had like a 2B market cap at the time).

Unlike GME, RKT also has good fundamentals, a $1 billion stock buyback on the table, management that has already set their targets on short sellers.  I have no idea what the squeeze is going to look like but this may even be crazier than GME.

Credits to u/undream22 for initial prospection and evaluation

**SUMMARY: A conservative valuation of Molson-Coors reveals a potential appreciation of 38.57%, indicating that the stock is currently oversold and has room for appreciation. Target value between 57.06 (*****book-value/share)*** **and 62.38 (*****forecasted value)*****. With this target, I predict a variable appreciation between 26.74% to 38.57%.**

Summary Valuation

# Methodology

*Citations will be marked \[content\]**^(EP)* *for materials in Earnings Presentation (EP), and \[content\]**^(ECT)* *for materials in Q4 Earnings Call Transcript.*

**REVENUE-EMERGING**

Take note of significant investments in revenue generation in emerging growth areas, including product lines ZOA, La Colombe, LA Libations, and Truss; of these, guidance forecasts $1 Billion revenue generation combined by 2023^(EP). Along with the capacity of manufacturing appx. 750m sleek cans, there is room for careful optimism in assessing future segments. Management states "" It will be a driving force behind our goal to build our emerging growth division into a $1 billion revenue business by 2023.""^(ECT)

With this in mind, I put forward an upwards bias for revenue forecasts, including the effect of CBD-drinks in Canada, and their eventual legalization and spread into the US Market.

**REVENUE-ESTABLISHED**

Note continued market share growth despite coronavirus, with miller lite (disgusting) up +8.6%^(EP), and Coors Light (pisswater) up +6.1%^(EP) both purely off-premise sales. With reopening likely, we can expect a sales normalization from Q3FY21 to Q2 FY22, where we can reach parity with 17-19 figures. Molson also doubled the US market share in Hard Seltzer^(EP) and double-digit growth (17%) in regional crafts.^(ECT) 

With regards to tech-sales, TAP experienced a 230% increase in eCommerce sales in the US Market.^(ECT)

**REVENUE-CONCLUSION**

With this information in mind, the company issues guidance for mid-single-digit sales revenue growth. Factoring pent-up demand from closing, we incorporate a higher-than-guidance growth of 5.5% for FY21. As full immunity is reached by late 2021-early 2022, as well as dedicated growth in marketing spending, revenue growth will spike to 9.5% throughout FY22 and FY23, before slowly trending downward towards 7.5% growth by FY26.

 Incorporating analysis of their production line expansion, COGS will likely trend down from 60.97% of revenue this year, to 56.55% by FY26, choreographing a yearly 74 bps improvement in profit margins. 

[Top Line and CAGR](https://preview.redd.it/rh7c9c201ok61.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f15a5b15abf653daac58e1a2abb07f97cecd67f2)

**Expenditures and Strategy**

Focusing on management remarks, the increased marketing spending^((ECT)) will go SG&amp;A, not only with an FY21 normalization to pre-covid levels but also sustained increases throughout FY23. Averaging 11.50% growth in SG&amp;A expenses, this will trend down towards 5.5% in FY26. As a % of Revenue metric, SG&amp;A expenses will peak through FY23-24 toward 27.48%, before moving towards a low-end historical share of 26.67%. 

Similarly, throw out all extra, unusual, and abnormal items before applying a high-end tax estimate^((ECT)) of 23% throughout the forecasting period. 

Therefore, while Gross Profit will grow at a CAGR of 9.36%, Operating Income will grow at 12.14%, reflecting margin improvements as revenues trend upward. Net Income will increase at a similar rate, but with a lower denominator, have a CAGR of 14.64%

&amp;#x200B;

[MidLine Summary](https://preview.redd.it/zbkt6jlu2ok61.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07cb0a1b1c982d62f11816a0faf664e79d4e9794)

**EPS and Dividends**

Including the prospect of stock repurchases, expect diluted shares to decrease by 50 bps every year incrementally. Adj. Diluted EPS excluding extras, unusual, and abnormalities will be used in order to accurately reflect the operating health of the company, sans any M&amp;A targets (which are unlikely considering the financing environment). 

As the situation normalizes, I expect the company to be cautious with regards to dividends in FY21, before increasing to $1.64/share dividends in FY22. There will likely be no increases, as more spending will be needed for market share expansion. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img btq73u1t3ok61...*

**Key Predictions**

Revenue to normalize by 2022, beat 17-19 performance by FY23.

Profit to normalize by 2022, beat 17-19 performance by FY23.

Operating Income to normalize by 2023, will not beat until FY24.

Net Income to normalize by 2024, will not beat until FY25.

EPS will normalize by 2022, beat FY17 performance by FY23.

**Methodology Summary:**

The method used is the EPS\*coefficient valuation method from ""Security Analysis"" by Grahm/Dodd,  with a 6-year horizon and earnings extrapolation. The Forward P/E ratio used is 12, roughly higher than the current 11.25 and 11.78 of FY20.

The open interest on the 30 and 30.50 calls that expire this week are way too high, and then all the open interest is on 29.50 calls next week. So basically what’s happening here is a big fund sold a shitload of calls at 30 and 30.50 for this week and then bought the 29.50s for next week. So basically the stock is gonna test 30 this week and then next week break 30 and all those calls for this week will expire worthless and whichever bank or fund who sold them will make a fortune and then next week all the 29.50s will exercise and then they’ll get the stock at a discount after hbo max numbers come out.

It happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Because three option classes expire all on the same day, it can cause increased trading volume and unusual price action in the underlying assets.

-Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.

-Triple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

-Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell—called the ""triple witching hour""—can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

-Triple witching days generate trading activity and volatility because contracts that are allowed to expire may necessitate the purchase or sale of the underlying security. While some derivative contracts are opened with the intention of buying or selling the underlying security, traders seeking derivative exposure only must close, roll out, or offset their open positions prior to the close of trading on triple witching days.

So this is what I get looking up why this is important, still learning stock terminology and significance of specialties like this one. Hadn’t really seen this talked about, just more so thrown out into the retardation of the echo chambers of multiple subs. 

Can someone with experience upon these specialty days within the stock market elaborate on what could be so important to happen upon this date?

GSV has recently pivoted towards new management with an end goal in mind. An acquisition of all its assets. The new CEO that was recently hired was Jason Attew who was responsible for Goldcorp’s corporate development and strategy culminating in the US$32 billion merger with Newmont Mining Corp. 

To start it off, I want to show the reasoning behind why I believe a merger is about to occur. In 2017 Jonathan Awde, the CEO and Director of GSV at the time acquired Battle Mountain Gold Inc and its “Lewis Project” on the battle mountain trend. This Lewis Project shares boundary with Nevada Gold Mines Phoenix mine, which is a JV partnership between Newmont and Barrick gold, two of the largest companies in the industry. Jonathan Awde the CEO/ Director/ Co-founder of GSV made a statement when this acquisition occurred, that being: 

“In our view, the Lewis Project is important to the ongoing success of Nevada Gold Mine’s Phoenix mine immediately to the south for three reasons… the value of the layback provides room for Phoenix to mine to the limits of the currently permitted pit, the added value of the mineral resources estimate which is continuous with the Phoenix mineralization, including the mineral resource estimate helps offset stripping costs for the expansion of Phoenix operations, and the Lewis Project has its own resource expansion potential to the north along the Virgin Fault, the main feeder for the phoenix deposit.”.

Why is this important you ask? Well in 2019 it was stated that “Barrick Gold and Newmont Goldcorp have formed a joint venture, combining their operations in Nevada in April 2019. Together they are estimated to hold some 48 million ounces of gold, which at current rates of production of about three million ounces a year, should last ***until 2022 under the best-case scenario***. Without further investment, therefore, the project is over”. This was stated in an article published in 2019 by Midas letter ([https://midasletter.com/2019/10/gold-standard-ventures-tsegsv-stock-bounced-back-and-posed-to-continue/](https://midasletter.com/2019/10/gold-standard-ventures-tsegsv-stock-bounced-back-and-posed-to-continue/)). 

It’s 2021, and the production timeline for the JV between Newmont/Barrick is drying up, and they need to purchase additional assets. If you look at the map of the land ownership, the Lewis project surrounds all of Nevada Gold Mines Phoenix Pit operations. [(https://goldstandardv.com/projects/lewis-project/) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/(https:/goldstandardv.com/projects/lewis-project/)%20)In order to make this land valuable to Nevada Gold Mines, it was required that there be proof of value tying to the land. So on May 5th, 2020, Apex Geoscience Ltd Stated the following about the Lewis Project: [https://goldstandardv.com/projects/lewis-project/](https://goldstandardv.com/projects/lewis-project/)

“APEX Geoscience Ltd. released a mineral resource estimate for the Virgin Deposit, located on the 100% owned Lewis Project, on May 5, 2020, in accordance with NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure. Highlights of the mineral resource estimate follow:

&amp;#x200B;

* Inferred Mineral Resource of 205,827      troy ounces of gold and 3,537,268 troy ounces of silver contained in 7.74      million tonnes at a grade of 0.83 g Au/t and at a grade of 14.22 g Ag/t      (at a lower cutoff of 0.20 g Au/t), yielding a combined total of 248,300      troy ounces of gold equivalent (“AuEq”) at a combined grade of 1.0 g/t      AuEq (using a ratio of 80 to 1 silver to gold).
* The MRE is based on 193 reverse      circulation holes, 33 diamond core holes, and 4 unknown holes. 
* Additional shallow gold and silver      resource potential exists to the east and west in related sub-parallel or      separate structural zones, with extensions to the Virgin Deposit open to      the north and at depth.  Mineralization at the south end of the      mineral resource area continues into the Phoenix open pit mine.
* The Virgin Deposit consists of      higher-grade structures surrounded by lower-grade disseminated      mineralization within a zone measuring about 725 meters in length at an      azimuth of 350 degrees, up to 325 meters wide which includes multiple      sub-parallel, sub-vertical zones, with up to 300 meters in vertical      depth.  The Virgin fault, which controls mineralization in the      Phoenix mine to the south, strikes northward out of the mine and onto the      Lewis Project where it also controls gold and silver mineralization in the      Virgin Deposit.  Gold and silver mineralization is associated with      northwest trending and steep westerly dipping structures in Paleozoic      sedimentary rocks.
* Near surface oxide potential (&lt;      40 m deep) remains open to the east (MAD-45, 22.9m grading 1.53 g Au/t and      22.9 g Ag/t and MAD-74, 24.4m grading 1.22 g Au/t and 55.0 g Ag/t) and to      the west (MAD-64, 13.7m grading 3.16 g Au/t and 163.6 g Ag/t and BVD-9A,      27.4m grading 2.17 g Au/t and 39.4 g Ag/t).
* In addition to the initial mineral      resource estimate at the Virgin Deposit, high-value exploration targets on      the Lewis Project include: 1) the Southwest skarn target where Barrick      Gold Corporation drill hole FWL-30 intersected 17 m of 5.7 g Au/t – an      intercept that remains open in multiple directions; and 2) the Buena-Vista      Meagher corridor immediately north of Nevada Gold Mines’  Phoenix      mine.  The strong gravity gradient and historic shallow intercepts in      upper plate Havallah Sequence rocks (including 27.4m of 2.20 g Au/t in      drill hole BVD-9A) indicate that structure and system should be present in      the favorable Antler host rocks at depth.  The potential grades noted      above are conceptual in nature; there has been insufficient exploration to      define further mineral resources and it is uncertain if further      exploration will result in these targets being delineated as a mineral      resource.”

Long story short there is immense value in $GSV’s assets that make the stock severely undervalued in its current state. The crazy part is, is that the Lewis Project is not even GSV’s main project. Their main project is the Railroad-Pinion project that’s scheduled to be on track to obtain permitting and development of mining operations by 2022. Feasibility study for this railroad pinion project is as follows: [https://goldstandardv.com/site/assets/files/4408/m3\_gsv\_revised\_pfs\_23\_03\_2020.pdf](https://goldstandardv.com/site/assets/files/4408/m3_gsv_revised_pfs_23_03_2020.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

* “Pre-tax net present value (“NPV”) of      $331.4M at a 5% discount rate and an after tax NPV of $265.0M at a $1,400      gold price and a $17.11 silver price, with a mineral reserve pit designs      based on a gold price of $1,250 per ounce and a silver price of $15.30 per      ounce.
* After-tax IRR of 40.0%.
* Average annual gold placement of      156,000 ounces of gold per year over an initial 8-year mine life.
* Average life of mine cash cost of      $582 per ounce after by-product credit, and all in sustaining costs      (“AISC”)1 of $707 per ounce.
* Proven and probable mineral reserves      of 1.246 million ounces of gold and 2.705 million ounces of silver.
* Life of mine strip ratio of 3.1:1.
* Initial capital expenditures of      $132.9M.
* Project economics include 15%      contingency”

TLDR - Newmont/ Barrick gold JV needs more land assets to survive. The previous CEO/ Director/ Co-Founder set a strategic plan in 2017 to force Newmont/ Barrick to have to merge or acquire GSV to continue operations in Nevada. It’s now 2021, and GSV is closer than ever to closing their late game plan. In the past 3 months insiders have sold 19.4k worth of GSV shares and purchased more than 100M worth of GSV shares. The company has a one-year high of $1.14 and a one-year low of $0.27. Right now it’s trading below the recent market offering price of USD$0.70, and resting at USD$.64.
