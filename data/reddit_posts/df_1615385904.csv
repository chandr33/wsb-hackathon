65,m1yp2e,"I don't have a financial degree or education to boast about, so i'll get right to why i think it is in your (and my) best interest to hold $GME.

Consider the following:

* Monke A bought 5 shares at 40 dollars.
* Monke B bought 5 shares at 150 dollars.
* Monke C bought 5 shares at 483 dollars.

Let's assume all three did their DD, read every WSB post about short ladders, buying the dips, and why this stock is a good investment because Ryan Cohen is going to take this company to rival the success of $AAPL and $TSLA in the future. They had the rug pulled on them in January. The stock went down to 40 dollars.

* Monke A didn't really feel a loss so he didn't sell. 
* Monke B pulled out his hair but he didn't sell. 
* Monke C sustained his body mass and massive brain this month by eating crayons, smeared his apartment walls with his own excrement and broke his keyboard so he didn't sell. 

Now we're a few minutes before open and we are close to hitting another magical high, a ""psychological barrier"" a ""resistance"" a ""sell-wall"" whatever you might want to call it based on the fancy trading strategies you read in books that are used by the market makers that take advantage of retail traders following their advice. What i'm trying to say is that many are in the green. And you can almost sniff those tendies like your anime figurine's panties before you upload the aftermath picture to your favorite subreddit. But consider this, is it really in your best interest to sell right now?

Monke A is definitely in the green, but he holds because he knows that Monke B is really greedy. Monke B knows that Monke C is still holding because he's in the red and too retarded to sell. I can't tell you what Monke C is thinking, because i think his investment strategy is to own Gamestop by paying the highest price per share, but even he knows there are others who just bought their tickets on the rocketship. So they can hold comfortably assuming they understand what this squeeze really means for those shorting it.

To summarize: there is no ""we"". If you want to take your big banana and shove it deep in your $ASS for instant gratification, by all means, i won't stop you. All im saying is that you can definitely get more bananas and (not medical advice btw) fit more than one banana in there. 

**Tldr: Cook your tendies well, because eating raw chicken can cause diahrea, vomiting, and regret.**
