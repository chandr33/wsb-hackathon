0,lwho1p,"Fellow retards, if you caught my previous WKHS DD, I want to start this off by saying I did not fuck you. Postmaster general DeCuck did. As a fuck you and knowing he’s on his way out seeing as he’s a Trump plant, he awarded your old baby clothes the NGDV contract. A company that didn’t even put forth a fully EV vehicle (more on this later). Did WKHS sell the fuck off right after the contract was announced? No doubt. Did I sell? Yes, but I’m back in with even more than I started seeing as I sold well before the bottom. Let me learn you a thing or two about why. 

When DeCuck made his decision, Dems flipped the fuck out. His decision went against the wishes of Biden and the Dems to electrify the federal fleet and start meeting carbon emission reduction goals. Plenty of reps including Tim Ryan from Ohio are insisting this contract award be revisited and reconsidered. This isn’t a fight they’re gonna give up on. WKHS has promised to challenge this decision and I’m sure if this stands many eco hippies are gonna lose their shit. What sounds impossible in reversing it isn’t that much of an impossibility at all. Enough about this contract though. 

Like I said in my previous DD, this company is so much more than this shitty government’s potential post office truck. They have potential suitors in IKEA, who are currently testing a fleet and aim to go all electric by 2025. They are focusing on researching and developing refrigerated vehicles. Once companies like Walmart and other similar companies start to look for electric grocery delivery vehicles, if WKHS captures this market its a big boost not only to the companies bottom line but to shareholders as well. 

Their horsefly drone is the real tech of the company though. Currently being tested by the UPS and patents pending for vehicle launched delivery drones, this is where I see the real growth and future of the company and I believe Mama Cathie sees as well. She doesn’t own over $45m worth of shares betting on a fucking contract, especially a government one. If they perfect this system, allowing for efficient and safe package delivery, and can manage a whole fleet with one single easy to use app they’re gonna boom. 

Institutions continue to BTFD and the company is up to 54% institutional ownership including big boys like Blackrock, Vanguard, Citi, ARK. There’s growth here, whales see it, and whales are buying it all the fucking time. 

They missed on revenue yesterday but that’s expected when 30% of their workforce was out with Covid for a time. Their EPS beat by a surprise $2,678% so...

Lastly, this company is a perfect candidate for a buyout and there’s chatter of a TSLA scoop up of WKHS. The EV world is increasingly becoming saturated with companies and they can’t all survive. Smaller ones can easily be bought by the big boys to try and ease this saturation and compete with one another. 

It’s found it’s floor IMO and the only way is up from here IMO but I’m a degenerate who thought the government could do something right for once. This company is poised for a strong reversal for many reasons and I’ve been following it for over a year.

So while I was watching this hot piece of tendies get taken away quite literally on a rocket I just felt more and more shame fill my body that I almost gave in and bought some calls when the stock was at $40, hell, if it had gone straight to $50 maybe I would’ve ended up buying, that’s how fucking horny I was for some gains

Alas, when the opportunity presents itself, chad mode activates. The volatility halt came in and I knew what would happen. Paperhands would paperhand and that’s the right time to get in on any rocket. I fired up my tradingview and made sure to watch the RSI, and just as it started to get too low for my comfort, I bought one $36 March 19th option at $6.50 cost

Rumours on the street, people bought up tickets for 6 month cruises already. People are restless and tired of being stuck at home. Old boomers wanna have a good time, gay couples want to see the Caribbean, middle class America want to go somewhere warm and fun but still close to the beach. You guys know where this is going. Cruise Lines are gearing up for pent up DEMAND.

Devoted cruisers are chomping at the bit to return to the seas and rivers. Their options are extremely limited this year, so many of them are making plans to sail in 2021.
And so, even despite the coronavirus pandemic, cruise companies and agency networks say bookings for 2021 are rising, giving the industry a much-needed ray of hope for recovery.
In business updates in recent weeks, both Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said 2021 bookings are “within historical ranges.” In fact, NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio said he was “astonished” by the booking strength.

The biggest news of this whole shebang, a couple can go 12 months with 0 yes ZERO revenue and still survive. After recent equity raises, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group have enough liquidity to weather up to 12 more months in an essentially zero-revenue scenario, William Blair said in a note.

-3 Insider positions increased and filed
-Updated Roth Analyst PT of $8-12 
-CATALYST: Q1 testing of CRV431 results announcement
-Mid 2021 Phase 2b testing for CRV431 results
-Vanguard just bought another 1.4M shares yesterday (3/1)

I am hoping when PR drops any day now, we see $4 give or take. If you are in it for the long haul, it could end up $8+
