12,m1g2np,"All last week was a “sell off”. some stocks fell harder than others. I ended up losing over $200K on CRSR (I’m back in was margin called). Stimmy passes and overall market was still down. Short interest data is released today and we have a Green Day. They’re saying it a bounce back after major sell off but what if it shorts covering. Even though the data is delayed. That way when we see that short interest is higher we buy and don’t screw them. Because they would have covered their positions before. 

For example crsr short interest is 20.87 as of 2/15/21 if short seller don’t cover today and the new data shows crsr has short interest of 30% as of 2/26/21 we would see that it’s getting shorted and not really a sell off plus last week was red so we can assume they’re still shorting and they would make all us idiot want to screw them over so we buy buy buy.

But if they cover today then they made their gains and don’t care

15,m1g2q8,"As title says. Robinhood literally never executes my options without a massive wait. I just was day trading some BAC options and I’ve run into two problems.

1. They lying:
Idk if anyone has run into this issue and as retarded I may be I wouldn’t do it twice. Both times I was day trading BAC. Essentially I go to double down and instead of buying more it executed a sell and closes my positions or when I go to exit my position it would make me buy more instead of closing the position. I could be retarded here but I wanna know if it’s me that’s the problem or if it’s robinhood doing some fuckery. So have y’all had a similar issue?

2. They won’t execute my orders:
I’ve had now several problems where BAC locks me out of profit by not letting me execute orders. Now I trade stuff that’s LIQUID AF aka BAC. The contract I was trading had nearly 6k OI and 13k in volume. It’s the $26 March 12 put. I had my order sat at $29 for nearly two minutes and it didn’t execute while the price indicated $29 for the put during the whole 2minutes. That may not sound like a lot but it is if ur day trading. Long story short BAC reverse and I ended up selling for a massive loss compared to unrealized gain. I also got cucked on RKT since I bought debit spreads and robinhood refused to let me sell them. The stock went up 70% but robinhood didn’t let me sell them for 20% gain and my spreads were ITM deep and liquid.


I’m looking for a broker that’s free or has reasonable fee’s for options trading with a friendly interface. I don’t care for charts since I use trading view and coin flips. 

I need four things:
1. Buy button
2. Sell button
3. Button showing me the price
4. Fast execution","What brokers y’all use? Robinhood cucked me way too many times, fuck them and citadel",1.0,1615323342,ErectoPeentrounus
