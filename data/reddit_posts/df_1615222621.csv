Here is my DD: I am hoping an Autist can help me understand. I am learning Options so I decided to get cheap OTM options that are like .03. I bought 10 for like $30. They are OTM c Options strike $23.

Every single day they spike for like 3 minutes. Day 1 they spiked to .54 a contract.

Day 2 (today) they spiked to .55 a contract so I sold.

The spike/moon happens so quickly by the time I saw it and sold it had dropped to .15 - still a nice profit.

Now, call me a retarded ape - the volume is so low it's like 0 or 2. Okay, I'm learning. So my contract probably won't sell but I went a bit further down the chain and bought one with more interest and volume.

a) why is it mooning and why for only like 5 minutes?

b) will I be able to sell one of these for some tendies?

Thank you in advance :)

This is the first time I’ve bought any stock at all and my dad thinks it was a dumb move to go with game stop, he said “they are going out of business, why the hell would you buy that”. Anyway, I put a decent amount of my savings into GME when it was at $119. I just wanted to ask all the big brains on here, realistically how high could this thing go? Trust me I’m holding for as long as possible, but I’m also scared to lose my money. What price do we see this climbing to? When is it ok to stop holding and start cashing in?
