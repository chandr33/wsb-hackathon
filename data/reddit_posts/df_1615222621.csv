Here is my DD: I am hoping an Autist can help me understand. I am learning Options so I decided to get cheap OTM options that are like .03. I bought 10 for like $30. They are OTM c Options strike $23.

Every single day they spike for like 3 minutes. Day 1 they spiked to .54 a contract.

Day 2 (today) they spiked to .55 a contract so I sold.

The spike/moon happens so quickly by the time I saw it and sold it had dropped to .15 - still a nice profit.

Now, call me a retarded ape - the volume is so low it's like 0 or 2. Okay, I'm learning. So my contract probably won't sell but I went a bit further down the chain and bought one with more interest and volume.

a) why is it mooning and why for only like 5 minutes?

b) will I be able to sell one of these for some tendies?

Thank you in advance :)
