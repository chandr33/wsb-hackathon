At the top you can see GME's charts, at the bottom AMC's charts, left side is ONE DAY chart, and right one is a ONE MOTNH chart. As you can see every time GME spikes or goes down, AMC follows, you can say, it is the market that is moving all together, but that is not true, I have position in other 10 stocks, and I have checked other stocks and I know for sure this cannot be just coincidence.

31,m2cdog,"At the risk of being downvoted to smithereens I'd at least like to say that I rode GME up both waves and made a lot of money. Now I may be a paper hander but I actually want to make a money. The platitudes of sticking it to the man don't interest me. You're crazy if you think that Plotkin and Ken Griffin weren't on their yacht in Miami partying/colluding to bail each other out. They frequently do that.

As we can see confirmed by Bloomberg, GME is no longer a brick and mortar store but can now be re-rated and valued as an ""e-commerce"" company thanks to Ryan Cohen. Kinda like Etsy, Amazon, and Chewy. So how much is this new company worth? Well it's currently 18 billion dollars in market cap, but you autists think it somehow deserves more without any road map of execution or even seeing Q4 earnings. We can pull out multiples but I think it's just shouting into the ether for now.

A company that last earnings call was at risk of being delisted. But now is free money either because of memes, a gamma squeeze(lol no, we can talk about why), or because of Ryan Cohen. My first point here is don't get too greedy if you actually want to make money. If you are just part of the movement then continue onward, GME to 1000. 

My next point is we can see how much those halts hurt momentum in the stock. Now for the last 5 trading sessions the % gain is getting smaller and smaller. Of course we can't expect +40% days everyday right? Well today we managed to squeak a win. Not looking so great as we become more and more risky price wise on again, a 18 billion dollar company. What is CRSR's market cap again? Okay, not a 1-1 comparison but you get my point. But what if Robinhood or other brokers decide to shutter buying so they can meet settlement/margin requirements? The only difference between then and now is $3 billion dollars, and now there are even more apes and tutes buying and selling this circlejerk. No doubt some of those shares are already failing to deliver. 

I only counsel you to hold back until we get closer to GME earnings so we have a better idea of whats possible. Of course GME could go to 1000 and everyone will come back to this post to promptly shit on my chest until I have to delete the post and commit sudoku for selling GME too early.

As a full blown retard who grew up in Wankada - one who has been ranting about how the system only favors the rich and screws the poor.

I and my homies never had father figures. It wasn’t because we didn’t have them around, but because they usually would go to work as early as before we woke up in the morning for school, and come back only after we’ve gone to bed.

The system screwed us all up, and gave us an illusion of success in the form of rappers. However, after doing due diligence on how to play the game and while falling to rise again, some of us have ended up in the diaspora working hard to keep the system alive, while some have come to pay back the hedgies who have been making have-nots out of hardworking people as a result of their unfair trading practices &amp; market manipulation.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice I eat crayons and just like bananas. 🍌🍌💎💎

Okay smooth brains. I'm reading alot about how the dip today was a short attack and how the article talking about the dip to 180 came out before the dip. I have a different theory.

The institutional whales were testing us today! Here is what happened in my opinion. They did a massive sell off when prices reached around 350. Why? A couple reasons. The first reason is that this dip causes GME to be on the short sale restricted list tomorrow (greater than 10% dip). Hedges wouldn't intentionally want to put GME on the Short sale restricted list. The second reason is to test retail resolve. Will this dip lead to a massive sell off or will retail quickly seize the opportunity to buy on the dip? Well we saw what happened there. only 💎✋s left in the game now. The paper handed individuals with stop losses have been culled. If the price had continued to drop from 180 we would know that it was from retail mass paperhanding out of fear. Now if you have been checking the option chain for GME you will notice that right after this dip a huge amount of 800$ calls were made. Almost 45K OPTIONS now at $800 that expire THIS FRIDAY. The dip to 180 caused these $800 calls to be much further OTM than they would have been at 350, and therefore much cheaper to purchase. take a look at the option chain yourself.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/

The stage has been set for the short squeeze! The high level of 800$ calls basically means that institutional whales are betting that the hedges will be margin called at $800 share price.

Remember my fellow apes. SELL AFTER THE PEAK. If you sell before the peak you won't know just high it will go. If we all have this strategy that is the most dangerous scenario for the hedges! (This is a casino and this is gambling so don't gamble what you can't afford to close and have an exit strategy in mind)

tldr - institutional whales caused the dip to load up on calls, put GME on the short sale restricted list and remove all the paperhands. GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

81,m2cj4a,"I was looking at the forming graph GME and it made me think ""Is it just me or this stock is almost exactly moving like the obvious one monthly, on the weekly. If my comparing is at all relevant with what's actually going to happen because let's face it, this is basic urges at play here and it is useless for me to repeat how similar GME and the obvious one are for the average joe, then we are yet to see the real spike. ( yeah, I sound like a believer, trust me I'm merely an observer in both the hypes.)    


So long story short, based on my elementary calculations, GME will pull back to lower 100s and then have a big break up to 1000+    in a span of 2 months, the bullish breakout happening only in 2-3 days instead of weeks.  


Now I am maybe just looking at a simultaneous graph. GME might not be following the obvious one at all and they could very well be synced already 260s being the equivalent of what rhe obvious one is at atm. BUT, 260 is not a HH like the obvious one. So that's my main backtesting to my hypothesis.   


I will be buying if that pullback happens, like 5 shares. Then when the real jump occurs. I'm pretty convinced because I'm only testing and trusting to the crowd behavior here, I think it would be fun to watch!   


To visually put it, I have distorted the two graphs below is  GME, and above is the obvious one.

85,m2cjcf,"Obligatory this is not financial advice. I am fully retarded and have no idea what I am talking about.

After comparing GME's (among other meme stocks) dip corresponding to the huge open for RBLX, we have the following for GME:

Time | Volume | Average Price | $$$

12:22 | 850752 | -316.345 | $(269,131,141.44)

12:23 | 62464 | -302.68 | $(18,906,603.52)

12:41 | 827428 |-185 | $(153,074,180.00)

Total | $(1,153,629,996.41)


Similarly for AMC (on the 5 minute interval because I’m lazy) = $(247,557,552.81)

For RBLX = $4,001,005,010.80 

That’s a delta of about 2.6 billion. If I wasn’t so retarded I would do the rest of the meme stocks and I bet that delta comes down to a more reasonable level.

Now looking at a random ass comparison (googled big video game ipo’s) to the ZNGA ipo in 2011:
The entire first day of trading ended in about a $1.1 billion change in market cap. In the day and age of WSB and the media coverage, I get that there would be more interest in the RBLX ipo, but this seems staggering compared to the first 30 minutes of RBLX. 

Hypothesis: Some institution(s) with a diversified memefolio thought all of the conversations on WSB regarding the RBLX ipo would mean we would all be switching. They tried to lead the switch by being first out/first in. This is not a knock on RBLX for a legitimate long investment, but the technicals for GME are still there. RBLX is setting up to be a pump and dump for the first few weeks of open.

Conclusion/TLDR: There is no ""we"" and I am a giant fucking retard. Suck these diamond balls, I'm not selling. I’ll invest in RBLX sometime after GME price hits $420,000.69.",A theory about the dip(s).,1.0,1615419997,clic45

94,m2ckws,"Way back when it dipped down to 40 a share I sold bc the thought of loosing more was keeping me awake. I was in the red of about 6000. I got it when it was around 150 again and sold at the high of 300!
Now I'm in the red of 1300. So I have to say I'm doing better than I was before but I can't keep doing that. My heart was hurting from before.
No diamonds for me but I hope some of you did good!",All done with GME... for now,1.0,1615420124,HoldUrButts
95,m2cl3o,"I already had my suspicions, but today confirmed this for me. Due to the quick fall from last semi-squeeze a few months ago, a lot of us retards are probably trading with a bit more care. Some of us are scared after having seen the stock drop from 483 to 40 in such a short time. However, the hedgies know this and they're going to try their damn hardest to scare you people. As seen the last couple of days they have barely be doing any small attacks to the stock, they know these won't even make us flinch anymore. My thought is that during the way up to the squeeze they'll only attack us with huge drops like today. The reason for this is purely because they want to simulate that downfall from last time to the best of their abilities. They want to make you think it's going to drop to 40 again and that you're gonna lose everything before you can react... However what they don't realize is that we are utter retards. And we utter retards need to keep in mind that, as long as we HOLD and buy those flash sales they give us, we'll be flying to the moon! Keep those diamond hands strong and let's fly together!
