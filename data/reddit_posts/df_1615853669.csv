27,m5w89m,"As a cannabis investor, one of my favorite debates to jump in or read is the MSOs vs LPs. However, those discussions are usually way too vague and should be comparing the top companies, at the very least, instead of a general US vs Canada. Let's talk about Trulieve and Aphria, mostly Trulieve. 

Multi State Operator (MSO) - US companies 

Licensed Producers (LP) - Canadian Companies. 


Trulieve's success is literally a house of cards, and I personally will enjoy watching it fall. Florida is one of the most restricted and monopolized cannabis markets in the US. Over 80% of the market is controlled by 5 companies, including Trulieve. This kind of market is exactly what our politicians pushing reform **DO NOT** want. This is not my opinion. This is easily concluded with ""social justice"" and ""social equity"" being at the forefront of legalization. It is the politicians intent to offer opportunities to minorities and communities hurt by marijuana prohibition and tax the fuck out of them on the back end. I think it's more likely these opportunities come on the retail side, not the production side. 

Trulieve has over 70 stores across Florida, and they are all vertically integrated. I know you already know what that means, but just in case: they sell their our products, and *only* their own products. It's a great business model of course, but it's all going to come crashing down for them and MSOs like them. Let's think about what a legal market does to a company like Trulieve.. 

As of a 2020 study, Florida had 1.1 dispensaries per 100k persons. States like Oregon with legal marijuana, or Oklahoma with a relaxed medical program each have over 15 dispensaries to every 100k persons. Considering Florida is the 3rd most populated state, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect similar ratios for dispensaries per 100k, if not higher. This would mean 15x more competition at least, literally. Even 30% less dispensaries per 100k than an average ""open"" market  would be 10 to 1, or 10x more competition. What's the bull thesis for Trulieve holding 50%+ market share in an open market like they do now in a monopolized market? Lol..

Also, as I've said before, they are currently vertically integrated and sell their own products **exclusively.** This will not last for many different reasons. So, they will see massive amounts of new stores opening around them, as well as having to stock their shelves *for the first time* with other brands. They will be losing daily customers in **droves**, and even the customers they do get in the door will be buying other products *not made by Trulieve*, which is going to hurt their margins and the bottom line. Hard. Then they will start to see an excess of marijuana as they struggle to distribute their over 1m sqft of grow space. If they lose even just 30% of their shelf space to competition (LOW estimate), they would lose 30% of shelf space across ever location they own. That's going to add up and *stockpile* quickly. 

This is where a genius thinks ""they will just sell their product into other stores!"" Okay. You're right there, but only to a certain degree. First off, I don't see companies who maintained a monopoly being welcomed warmly into a legal market. It's pretty easy to conclude more people will approach Trulieve with a grudge rather than a chubbie. Also, how many Trulievers will there be when *hundreds* of new brands are introduced? 


Meanwhile APHA is already selling ""weed beer"" to 23 States and all Delta Airlines Flights, hosts the largest 420 festival in Atlanta, AND busy tackling a global cannabis market while they wait for the US to open. Literally building a monopoly in the EU. Obviously the US is the crown jewel, but even Curaleaf's CEO sees more opportunities in Europe than the US in the coming years. So while Trulieve spends millions on stores in a single state, APHA is spending millions building a global cannabis conglomerate. These two stocks are not built the same. 

By the way to be clear, I think LPs like APHA/TLRY, CRON, CGC, and even OG-I are in a better position than MSOs like TRU, High tide, and any other retail heavy or monopoly focused companies. 

It's the MSOs ready for the Next Green Wave (&lt;----) who have 2 year supply agreements with the largest brands in cannabis (Cookies) in the largest markets (California) and MSOs with proven success as CPG businesses in crowded markets (FFNT) who should be getting more attention. Not companies who **suffer** from legalization like TRU and SSPK. Weedmaps is just a complicated google search. Lol stores will operate their own online websites with online menus and not pay a commission to weedmaps 🤷.

I'm not an expert or anything, but I feel like people are saying they are investing in upcoming change, but make decisions based on the market now. The market you're investing for and the market that exists have very little in common, generally.

35,m5w9o1,"Might be a little late to the punch, but I just saw the news for the first time.  I think the most important takeaway from this is that they are BBB- rated.  For those of you that do not know much about bond ratings, there are two ""main"" types of ratings with many ""sub-ratings"": investment-grade and non-investment-grade.  High-rated investment-grade bonds typically have low-interest rates but are pretty much guaranteed to pay out.  Low-rated non-investment-grade bonds typically have high-interest rates but have a lower chance of paying out.  Why is BBB- important as a rating that Citadel received for its bonds? Well, because it is the LOWEST investment-grade bond rating.  Right on the border of non-investment-grade.  (Insert conspiracy theory here)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR They are issuing medium-risk investment-grade bonds at a time when they are claiming that everything is fine.

45,m5wamk,"So why have treasuries *actually* tank recently? Is the wave of hyper-inflation finally coming? Probably not.

The recent drop in treasuries was likely just the result of some boring banking regulation exemptions expiring this month. Back in March 2020 bank deposits and US Treasuries were exempt from what is known as the ""Supplementary Leverage Ratio"". Since this is really hard to explain accurately and briefly, and most of you can't read anyway, the nutshell version is that SLR tells banks they must have a certain amount of ""capital"" relative to various assets on their books (investments, deposits, etc) in order to ensure a bank can withstand a market downturn.

Why do you care? Well, the SLR exemption expires this month, which means that both UST and customer deposits will now factor back into this equation. At the same time, the banks are about to take in a shitload of stimulus money as deposits. Also, the FOMC meets tomorrow and will likely be deciding on whether they will extend the SLR. Last time around, a lot of Democrats were *very* against these SLR exemptions and there is a good chance the SLR rule won't be extended due to political factors regardless of economic/financial factors. Likely, banks having been dumping UST to come into compliance with regulations after this exemption expires. 

Additionally, whether the Fed will implement some type of yield curve control will likely be decided at this meeting. We'll be hearing about that on 3/17, which means there's likely to be heavy volatility in treasuries this week. If the SLR exemption is extended or the Fed announces some type of ycc, we might see treasuries eaten up at the end of the week. If they announce neither, we might see another dump.

I honestly have no idea which way it will go, but the volatility on TLT is low enough that I don't see any reason you can't play both sides.

P.S., because the mods have decided to put filters in I can post but can't reply to your comments until I whore myself for more comment karma, so I'll try to PM you if you leave a decent question.

70,m5wglc,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

79,m5whyt,"MO AKA Altria currently has 49% ownership of CRON, they are also breaking out of A 4 year base, and nearing a breakout on the weekly chart with a close over 49.96 on Friday. This is just the beginning. It’s public that Altria is lobbying in congress for cannabis to be legalized and that they plan on being a big player once it is. It starts to get interesting when on top of the CRON ownership, they also have 4.9B in cash on hand, obviously they won’t spend ALL of it on acquiring and growing more in the weed sector but to put that in perspective, they have nearly the same amount of CASH as TLRY is worth at a whole. To me, this shows that no other company currently has the cash to grow in the field like Altria does. It’s hard to say wether they will begin to out right buy out smaller growers in areas like CA where growing costs are lower, or if they look to take ownership in more established names like they have with CRON already. Regardless, the potential for growth is there. Now what you’ve all been waiting for, Jan 2022 75 calls are currently .30, which is only 50% OTM, with both cannabis legalization and any significant growth in that sector by Aphria makes a 50% gain for them possible by even June. Although I think it is in the 60s by mid April. By EOY I believe they can be at 90+ with new valuations and recalculated P/E for this new growth, in which case, those options would profit over 5000%. Even if you want to play stock, you get an insane dividend of ~3.50 a share to hold it for the year regardless. Seems like a no brainer and due to 0 upwards activity in 4 years OTM calls are dead cheap for NO REASON. 

TLDR: MO breaking out of 4 year down trend, and potential to be top player in US Cannabis with 4.9B cash on hand ready for growth in the sector. Jan 16 22 75c @.30
