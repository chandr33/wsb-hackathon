I've seen a lot of people asking about the SSR rule that the SEC has. People saying that GME can only be shorted if it's green or saying that it can't outright be shorted at all. But even I, with my smoothest of brains, was able to pretty much instantly find some info on Google. 

https://www.warriortrading.com/short-sale-rule-day-trading-terminology/

Please correct me if this is not the right rule and us just something similar but as I understand it, with the SSR active for GME shorts can only be purchased when the STOCK PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE BID PRICE. Which happens CONSTANTLY. It happens so frequently that it seems like this rule is virtually ineffective. If I'm wrong or uninformed please help me out.

Gamestop has a market cap of $17.85B

[https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/market\_cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/market_cap)

&amp;#x200B;

As a pure apples to oranges comparison, you can see that revenue and number of employees (aka infrastructure of the company) between Chewy and Gamestop is close. Now if you took out the veterinary care of the market size for pets, you'd see that it is actually about $57Billion. Which is really close to the $60 Billion of the Video Game market. Since Chewy doesn't compete in the veterinary space this should be removed from it's calculation.  Looking at how similar the companies are on these fronts, it's odd that Gamestop is at HALF THE MARKET CAP! AKA. If we valued the potential for Gamestop the same way we value Chewy it would be worth DOUBLE IT'S CURRENT PRICE. 

If you truly believe Ryan Cohen can turn Gamestop around and into the online video game specialty retailer that he envisions, it is UNDER PRICED STILL! On top of this if you think about competitors in the video game retail arena, you realize that there are NO MAJOR VIDEO GAME ONLY RETAILERS besides Gamestop (GameFly might be trying to compete now that they sell products not just rent. But they did [under $25 million in revenue](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.gamefly_holdings_llc.c04ff26cf1b0dd7e9ba46e1207014416.html)). Chewy on the other hand is competing with dozens of companies that specialize in pet products. Plus GameStop has the brand name recognition from years of being in business, a Pro Rewards membership program with probably millions of members, and has a massive trend going for it online currently.

So, I am sure we are all aware of the previous XPEV ride that occurred, but currently, I think there should be some reconsideration.

Consider the following along analyst ratings:

&amp;#x200B;

Max upside based on ratings is $68.20

Current price is $34.29

Price jumped nearly $4 today (Up $3.51 on the day, and was at $4 earlier today)

Current trend is an upswing which means it has room to move:

News wise, there are new vehicle launches, plus an upgrade from Daiwa capital to Buy

Across the analysts, they are currently rated 4.1/5 as a buy

They had a 345% increase in revenue year over year

China is the largest EV market in the world right now AND XPEV are also expanding into Europe

As a pure apples to oranges comparison, you can see **that revenue and number of employees (aka infrastructure of the company) between Chewy and Gamestop is close.**  Now if you took out the veterinary care of the market size for pets,  you'd see that it is actually about $57Billion. Which is really close to  the $60 Billion of the Video Game market. Since Chewy doesn't compete  in the veterinary space this should be removed from it's calculation.   Looking at how similar the companies are on these fronts, it's odd that **Gamestop is at HALF THE MARKET CAP!** AKA. **If we valued the potential for Gamestop the same way we value Chewy it would be worth DOUBLE IT'S CURRENT PRICE.**

If  you truly believe Ryan Cohen can turn Gamestop around and into the  online video game specialty retailer that he envisions, it is UNDER  PRICED STILL! On top of this if you think about competitors in the video  game retail arena, you realize that there are NO MAJOR VIDEO GAME ONLY  RETAILERS besides Gamestop (GameFly might be trying to compete now that  they sell products not just rent. But they did [under $25 million in revenue](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.gamefly_holdings_llc.c04ff26cf1b0dd7e9ba46e1207014416.html)).  Chewy on the other hand is competing with dozens of companies that  specialize in pet products. Plus GameStop has the brand name recognition  from years of being in business, a Pro Rewards membership program with  probably millions of members, and has a massive trend going for it  online currently.

All told, I like the stock. In for 42 shares (the answer to life, the universe and everything).

TL;DR: **If we valued the potential for Gamestop the same way we value Chewy it would be worth DOUBLE IT'S CURRENT PRICE.**
