2,m5u4q0,"I just initiated a short position on GRPN today.  I've found that stocks have a strong tendency to be rejected as they test their 200 WEEK moving average.  I  realize many folks use the daily moving averages but I tend to prefer the weekly as this resistance is very strong.

There is also significant downward trendline resistance going all the way back to the peak at the end of 2013.

RSI, MFI, and CMF are all massively overbought.

  
In summary, I expect a significant downward moving in the coming week and have positioned as such.

85,m5ufs5," 

Not financial advice, only personal thought on the sudden dip on GME.

We should know perfectly that GME becomes a zero-sum game between the long side and the short-seller. When the short squeeze happens, many of the short-seller would go bankrupt and be forced to liquidate most of their asset. They would try everything they could to drive down the price from doubling down short, MSM FUD, or other ways.

The main players in GME are retail investors, long side HF, short side HF, and many passive funds.

We definitely know that the short squeeze did not happen at the current price level. What could cause someone to dump the price? It is improbable the massive dip was driven from the long side of profit-taking. Because such a massive dip must from the institutional level, and most of the institutional profit-taking has happened in the first round. And in the second run-up, people have a higher entry price point and better understand how the short squeeze should play out. With the higher entry point and higher expectation price, long side investors are less likely to sell their whole position at the current price for profit-taking. So, It must come from someone who wants to drive down the price for their best interest. Yes, the short seller.

Because at this point, there is no exit strategy for the short-seller to exit safely. They are truly at either profit or bankrupt. Suppose they decide to double down short positions and people sell-off. They would end up a nice profit from GME. Even if a short squeeze happened, they are no worse than covering their position rn. Therefore, doubling down would be their only option at this time. And they had changed their way of shorting the stock instead of keeping the price steady downward. They are letting the price climb and patiently borrowing or even buying some of the shares to dump at once. They know that people would not sell off their shares unless they were convinced that the short squeeze had happened and people are dumping the stock. So they wait for the price to break into 350 and dump the price lower and lower to fake like the short squeeze happened last week.

Essentially, they have a limited amount of time to convince the long side investor to sell their shares. If their tactics do not convince people, they will go bankrupt, the same as they are covering their short position now. It is become risk-free for the short-seller to doubling down and spread the FUD with MSM. They would try this again and again to convince people. But it is not gonna work!

Because 💎🖐💎
