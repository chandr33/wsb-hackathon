15,m71aii,"Since the fundamental value of GME is much lower than the current (technical) value, what is each shareholder's exit strategy?  A big unknown is when lots of shorts decide to start to cover, or massive buying starts to occur in order to cover calls that approach ITM, how high will the price actually go before the diamond hands get mushy and become paper hands and lots of shares become available?  Will the price get to the Moon ($1k), Jupiter ($10k), Pluto ($100k), or the next Galaxy ($1m)?  What if (when) an institutional investor with lots of shares which are generally considered to not be part of the daily float decides to sell his shares and take the profits, which may be considerable?   

What is your exit strategy?  No one wants to be the last ape holding a bag of high-priced bananas!

There is an interesting trade opportunity I came across when researching small cap stocks with new high volume and massive potential. Ticker $PPJE, with an average volume of 150,000,000 could be the next GME. Many articles about this company say its stock could roar to 50$ creating over a 700,000% gain. If this community of traders came together to buy this stock we could easily blow past this price target for hundreds thousands percent gain.

78,m71oq1,"I have 255 shares @88. I was thinking of doing covered calls to make a $900 per contract on a March 26th $600 weekly. But then I asked myself a couple questions. 1. Who do I really make money from? Idiot retail investors or hedgies? 2. Will my 100 shares be borrowed to help hedgies? Could they pump and dump and fuck us over? Is it beyond the pale to think they wouldn't stoop to this level? 

I decided that since you retards with your dd have stated the -8 beta etc and some other retards postulated that hedgies must sell off other positions to make up their losses that the best play IMO is to buy up all the stock and never place covered calls. Don't sell shares and patiently wait for the hedgies to sweat. I have a $360 call on March 26th. Whether ITM or OTM, I'm exercising that option. Drop the price more? I'll buy more. I'm not wasting my time on other ""meme"" stocks. That's their way of dividing our efforts to invest in gme. NFA, I'm a disabled vet who's retarded as fuuuuuuuuuuck.
