Not sure how this stock isn't getting more visibility, here are the summary points for you monkeys who dont want to read the original post. I look forward to your thoughts

1. Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of the company
2. There is currently 113m shares outstanding of which MeetKevin's stream on youtube showed from his S3 terminal that the short interest increased to \~41% yesterday.
3. RKT recently announced a **1 billion dollar buyback** program. At the time of writing this, $RKT is sitting around $29 x 114m shares = 3.3B in float. **Buyback will reduce available float by 30%**
4. We have a catalyst event of a **$1.11/share special dividend**
5. Bonus: CEO is a baller with big balls and wants to stick it to hedge fundies who have been keeping his stock down - the company is not a meme stock, it has solid fundamentals but that is for a different post.

As I opened my TD account while sitting in the passenger seat, a barrage of uncontrollable honking from a tow truck ensued. My wife’s boyfriend, who was driving me (nice guy btw), was concerned that something was wrong. As I looked up at the driver, he proceeded to smile at me and give me a thumbs up. It was at that moment that I realized why he was honking at us. He was sending me a message. That he, too, is a 💎🤲 ape. He then raised his fist to remind us that apes together are strong. We both happen to love GameStop and will do whatever to save it.

It was so beautiful that I nearly cried. It became clear that we are voyaging into deep space. Boldly going where no 💎🤲 ape has gone before.

I just wanted to send you a friendly reminder that we in the know, *actually* like the stock. So act like it. 

# What do I mean by this? 

Well, when your GPU shits out because you're watching 10 Google Chrome tabs of VR Hentai porn at the same time, get your new one at Gamestop. 

When your annoying cousin wants a new Xbox for his birthday, get him an Xbox 360 with Madden '13 at Gamestop. 

When you accidentally blow your load and fry your keyboard, get your new one at Gamestop. 

# Do YOU like the stock? Prove it. 

A company only succeeds when its investors and customers understand the value that they offer and choose to do their shopping at their establishment. You should support your favorite businesses, and don't rely on others to keep them afloat. Gamestop is in its prime right now and doesn't even know it. The gaming industry is one of the most rapidly growing industries on the planet. Covid has certainly helped fuel this trend, but as a gamer myself, I know that it's here to stay. 

# A list of things that GameStop offers (or might potentially offer in the future) that make shopping with them appealing:

\- Buyback services for old and unused consoles and games. 

\- Free same-day delivery. Yes. FREE SAME DAY DELIVERY. 

\- Retail locations in all major cities, meaning that you do not need to deal with supply chain issues and lead times from overseas manufacturers. 

\- Pre-Owned gaming equipment (Retro Consoles, value-priced newer consoles)

\- Frequent, appealing sales.

\- PowerUp Rewards and loyalty points.

\- ^((my personal favorite theory about the future of GameStop)) A potential partnership with Tesla to offer a proprietary game marketplace exclusive to Tesla vehicles. In other words, when you stop to charge, you can make it a ""GameStop.""

# Don't let the stock market distract you from what is important. Some of us actually believe in the business behind GameStop. 

I remember going to my local G-Spot when I was young and buying Gran Turismo 3 like it was yesterday. A gentleman was there to sell his copy of the game to the store, and I ended up buying the game off of him for a few extra bucks with my $20/w allowance. I will always have this memory because the manager actually encouraged it. He would rather see a 12-year-old kid enjoy the game than make a sale. This is the type of culture that will always keep me coming back to the stores. A genuine love for gaming. 

Stocks go up, stocks go down. GameStop *however*, is here to stay. 

# Power To The Players. 

^(Hold.)

Ape","Just a reminder, we do in fact, like the stock.",1.0,1614704156,matttinatttor

29,lw6rhh,"I listened to the earnings call last night for OraSure Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSUR) and they lost more money! They missed Q4 earnings by $0.04. They expected to earn $0.07 per share but only achieved $0.03. On news like this you would expect the stock to go lower. I kept listening and they said they will roll out the first antibody Covid-19 test authorized by the FDA that uses oral fluid samples. They are working with the FDA right now and expect to submit their Emergency Use Authorization this month. It will take the FDA 6-8 weeks to approve the test and then they can begin to market the tests. They will be selling 50 million tests and assuming a $10 wholesale price, that is $500 Million in extra revenue this year. For a company worth less than $800 Million to sell $700 Million in product I would expect the future value of the stock to rise several fold. Can someone check my math? What would the net revenue be on that extra $500 million of revenue.

Pay close attention to the last question in the Q&amp;A, Dr. Vijay Kumar, Managing Director of Evercore ISI penciled out the forecast for 2021 to be the sub $700 million in revenue. With base revenue of $150 million a year for core products. OraSure now plans an additional expansion of 50 million Rapid Antigen Self-Tests, bringing capacity to 120 million tests per year (including tests for HIV, HCV and Ebola) by the second quarter of 2022. The price should shoot up right?
