The prospectus indicates this will happen, ""the 21st scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 1, 2021."" If you take the minimum conversion of 5.3763 shares X the current value of common shares of $130.49, that equals $701.55.

TL;DR up front:   
Don’t buy stocks in firearms or ammunition manufacturers just because you expect incoming legislation. The fact that people are buying lots of guns and bullets does \*not\* mean that gun manufacturers are raking in money hand over fist. The market could not possibly care less about your emotional investment one way or another in  the subject and you will lose money.   
BRIEF:   
There is a weird, sadistic, self-righteous ideology floating around that gun companies make loads of money off of tragedies and the threat of gun legislation.   
REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS ON FIREARMS, the numbers don’t pan out, and it’s a dumb, emotionally charged way to throw money around.   
If this was anything resembling a reliable way to make money, a lot more people would be doing it.   
I’m gonna get into some sensitive stuff here, apologies in advance. It’s not my intention to make anything resembling a political point, I only want to demonstrate that the threat of impending gun legislation does \*not\* impact the stock price of gun manufacturers. Nobody gives a shit about your politics here unless they make money. I’m not making money with this one, but rather, trying to help keep you from losing money. And that’s sort of the same thing. Unfortunately there’s only a sample size of three stocks, because gun manufacturers are small and not super valuable. Who’da thunk.   
I have compiled a list of 10 events where gun control was enacted, threatened, or speculated.   
 

![img](bfpuy5u0cxl61 ""Nov 4th, 2008 
Obama elected
Sharp drop observed in SWBI and RGR, continuing on an overall slight downward trend in both cases for well over a year. VSTO not publicly traded until 2015. Note that Obama is broadly regarded tongue-in-cheek as the best gun salesman ever because of various thoughts, both valid and fabricated, about his policy choices and actual breadth of power. "")

![img](yaim3sa6cxl61 ""July 20, 2012
Aurora CO cinema mass-murder
Dec 14, 2012
Sandy Hook mass-murder
Aurora shooting interrupts moderate upward trend with momentary “hiccup”, then previous pattern resumes.
Sandy Hook shooting and resulting media blitz coincide with selloff, dip, and trends resuming patterns similar to what they were before. "")

![img](4nwrktshcxl61 ""Jan 5,  2016
Obama press conference on gun control through executive action
June 12, 2016
Orlando nightclub mass-murder
All three manufacturers either flat or uphill going into 2016, entered sharp decline at beginning of year. Trend resumes roughly halfway through January for all three. 
Dip going into April gives way to upward trend with a hiccup in the beginning of June for all three, does *not* line up with June 12th Pulse nightclub shooting. Trend continues roughly on from Springtime trend until August where it reverses. "")

![img](ijwzy9nncxl61 ""Oct 1, 2017
Vegas mass-murder
All three trading either flat or downward overall for up to a year afterward. "")

![img](v542l5mmcxl61 ""Feb 14, 2018 
Parkland mass-murder
Vista was down, S&amp;W was largely sideways with boomer-level percentage gains. Ruger was actually doing pretty hot, but considering this is the first time we’ve seen this result in any of these, I have to say it feels like a fluke. "")

![img](3xqoti4ncxl61 ""Mar 26, 2019
Trump bans bump stocks
Ruger continues unaffected on trend from beginning of month. S&amp;W trading sideways from beginning of month. Vista takes a small bump that takes almost a month and a half to materialize, but is quickly back down. "")

![img](uwccesxlcxl61 ""August 3, 2020
ATF C&amp;D order on Honey Badger pistol (attack on forearm braces)
Nov 3, 2020
Biden wins election (running on a platform including promise of severe antigun legislation. 
Ruger and S&amp;W down sharply after ATF letter received by Q. Vista down momentarily, but heavily buoyed by the September acquisition of Remington’s ammunition production business. So instead of down, they’re just sideways.
Election does nothing interesting for stock prices.  Note how everything is sideways after that point despite the outlandish and unprecedented demand running since March 13th."")

MORAL OF THIS STORY:  
Quit telling people to buy stock in gun manufacturers because you think there might be incoming legislation. It’s a giant red flag that says “I am unable to comprehend the complicated nature of the relationship between manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and transient market events and how they affect long-term demand for durable goods”.","Case study on gun company share prices vs. threat of legislation or crisis (VSTO, SWBO, RGR)",1.0,1615262277,Redtail_Defense

**LYRICS:**

Hit em with the memes, you know what I mean?

Hit em with the memes, you know what I mean?

**Verse1:**

Diamond hands, diamond hands,

Hodlng til on the moon we land,

Hodling til we land on Mars,

Hodling til we’re past the stars

A dumb ape, d\*generate money

Or so they say, I play my cards funny,

And with it my rockets running

Ready for blastoff gamestop coming

For at least a 100k

Maybe a milli or so they say

Don’t be silly I’ll never sell

Til these hedgies burn in hell

That’s right I’ll never sell,

Don’t matter how you scream and yell,

These games y’all keep playin

It’s time to get payin

For ‘08 the crimes, all the nickel and diming

And even then, it’s blasting higher, a new world, with a new buyer

the gamer is changing and paving the way

so what do you say? dare you play with a player, or say your prayers?

Or do you even care, your hate so dismissive,

Pretending it wasn’t you who did this, complicit, who is it

that is feeding you all dem lies,

yes I know that you tried, explicit, implicit, exquisite, more digits

We need more zeroes behind that 1,

Joe Biden let it run, let gamers have their fun,

and onto the moon we come

Apekind in outerspace, without a trace

of the evil behind us, let us not remind us of our mistakes

That we leave in the past, and lets not make it last, so we can move on fast to a new world and generation

The space ape gamer confederation

Is the one nation to unite under

No need to wonder how we make it past

ego-filled greed and cheats,

looking real beat, they weep,

hop to this beat, gamestop bananas we eat

do what we do, gme crew, buy, hodl, wait until we flew

Way past the moon, it’s coming soon, and

never let go, lamers say no, that’s how we know the squeeze is a go,

don’t take it slow, bc it’s time for sure,

and they put on a show, mass manipulation,

they testing ape patience, but diamond hands is all we do 💎🙌

**Bridge:**

That’s all we do that’s all we do!

Diamond hands! Diamond hands!

Buy hodl buy hodl

**Verse2:**

Hedgies With their shares shorted, a grave deeper than hell,

they cannot abort it we got a Roaring kitty

as well as simple apes, a clash of faith, a mighty battle of fate, to push us to the gates, we won’t be late to GameStop,

make this game stop, no more lies no more cries of fake news of gme being pu.mped up cuz why

Its a new world, a new way, gamers get their say, it’s who these hedgies feared while they were cheating that day,

miserable fools with their money foolishly on display, so we can hang on you apes, this final boss we’ll slay

Without delay, we’ll grind til the time is right DFV, Domo, apes y’all all helped shined the light, end is in sight we shall fight to slay this beast together with diamonds hands high, that’s right,

THIS IS THE WAY!

All of Our might

Faith without sight, all day and all night, depth of their fright, emojis we type, these memes are spicy and ripe,

These apes are reaching new heights, get ready for flight

We gotta do what is right

Do our due diligence and consensus we trust,

The evil try to split us with lust,

For money give up, it’s rough

But diamonds hands will hold tough because its love because its us it’s who we trust

And we must, never give in to them or give up

Diligent apes gaming to find a new plus

That’s a positive way to keep us away from the rust, keep evil at bay, fade it to dust, we are the gust, blow it away, don’t let it sway you Ok?

When they come asking for this, or asking for that, remember 08 because they skate with words and lie to your face

Keep pace, keep space away from the FUD

Coming from duds a literal disgrace to apes and all shapes

So save for only what you really need, we need as many apes to take on the machine, that grinds us to dust

**Outro:**

Cede and company, is trying to take a seat in your brain and operate you from behind the machine

That’s C E D E. They own the dtcc. There’s no names of who operate this shell. Let’s find the board and man behind the machine

So yeah don’t cede yourself to cede co. Check em out. Again they’re part of the dtcc. That’s the depository trust and clearing corporation. They take your money and try to take your mind body and soul, but they can’t.
