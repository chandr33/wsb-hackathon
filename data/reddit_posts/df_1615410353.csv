Hey guys, I am a nobody, and I have nothing. I am new to the world of investing, but I have finally found a home where I belong with my fellow apes. My eyes have now been opened to the inequality of our system and its disgusting design, which hinders our ability, and right to grow and prosper. Sadly, our future is constantly being toyed with by gatekeepers who do not want us to become successful because they enjoy praying on the weak and stealing the fruits of their labor. I am attaching a screenshot of how my paper hands have now turned into diamond hands after experiencing today's market manipulation and seeing the truth. Sorry for being a paper-handed ape, but I am ready to battle. RIP grandpa. I love you. I don’t need this money and hope you all make your dreams come true, whether it's landing on the moon or holding your wife's boyfriend's hands. I am fully retarded.

16,m28jus,"The market closed at 246 yesterday, tuesday the 09/03. The market opened at 269 10/03 after an immense rise in the pre market. 

The prise then raised to ≈300 in the timespan of 7-11:30. Within this timespan 11:30 - 12:18 The price exploded from  ≈ 300 to  ≈ 345  
Then suddently the whole market froze. A few minutes went by and then GME plummeted for the first time. Throughout some time the market kept unfreezing and freezing. Eventually GME dropped to 172, which has become the day's market low. GME had since the plummeting recovered and is now (14:45) at  ≈249.

Today is wedndsay 10-03

On friday 12/03 there are a lot of options that expire. I calculated that there was 51.537 Call options  ITM at the strike price of 330(this calculation was made a little earlier today- Data from Yahoo). These options are causing the gamma squeeze. The market makers aren't happy when it regards to gamma squeeze, since its them that has to cover the money for it.   


**gamma squeeze and call options (skip if you already know):**   


Basically the Market makers create these so called call options. Money makers loose, if the price of the stock behind the option rises. And the ape who bought the call option wins money, if the price of stock behind the call option rises.

This is how it works:

Ape buys option from market maker. The strike price is 300. If price goes beyond 300 the ape has the option to buy the stock of the market maker for 300. Lets say the price went to 340. The ape can buy the stock for 300 of the market maker, due to apes bought option. The ape makes 40 dollars and the market maker looses 40 dollars. These options have expiration days. The expiration days are typically on fridays. (""fridays"" is very important, since what i suspect is, that the money makers prevent GME from its potential before fridays to prevent hitting multiple strike prices)

Lets say there is thousands of apes who got these options and GME goes beyond their strike price. The market makers has to cover a lot of options. This means that market makers has to go and buy a lot of stocks. If you know about supply and demand, you know what then happens. GME goes up. This will then trigger more strike prices. Then the market makers has to gather even more GME to cover more options. When this keeps happening and the price of GME explodes, it is a gamma squeeze. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her are the options for GME: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we look back to the previous squeeze that happend over a month ago on january 26th to february 2nd a similar scenario occured.

The price exploded from monday 26th to thursday 28th.

Thursday morning, January 28th:

GME had peaked at 483. Then evil market makers as RobinHood prevented users from buying the stock we like GME. Creating the market low 265. This happend a thursday. The day before a friday.  Since the prise of GME dropped by so much on thursday the power of the gamma squeeze declined. - We didn't reach the amount of strike prices that we could of have. The specific days that these events happend on are very important, since the expiration day of call options are on fridays. 

Friday 29th of january the price went up again by a lot (propably not more since less strike prices where hit). Friday 29th market high 413.98. After this, there was a free fall until tuesday february 02.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back to the freezing events of today on a WEDNSDAY. I do not think that the freezing was a coincidence.  The whole market froze a couple of times. It started freezing straight after an immense price raise from 300 to 345 ish within less than an hour. I interpret that this extreme volatility made everyone quite excited and nervous (if the freezing was planned to be a following of the extreme volatility, to create extra panic, then well played market makers). When the first freeze happend straight after the extreme volatility everyone paper handed. Then the price plummeted all the way down to 172 throughout the events of the multiple freezing. 

What could we learn from that? I dont know, i am not a financial adviser. Atleast i know, that i wont panic if odd events happens, because i like the stock. Well the market makers are doing desperate moves to prevent the gamma squeeze. If i remember correctly, i read Heyitspixel writing something like the following: we should see market makers and hedgies as lions in a corner. They would do anything to get away.  


I think that the two moves that happend today and on februray 28th had the same goal. Assuming that todays events weren't coincidence. It was to reduce the price of GME and preventing GME from hitting more strike prices before a friday (option exercise day). This then had the other wanted effect of declining the power of the gamma squeeze, which saves the market makers money. The price is now lower than before which equals to less call options that are going to get exercised on friday, which is in two days (12/03). Even if the stock rises above 350 before friday, the move of freezing propably reduced the potential of the gamma squeeze.

Well i still think that there is gonna be a gamma squeeze. Maybe just a smaller one than what it could of have been. Unlessssssss there becomes a generel bigger confidence and GME just rises like a rocket. 

I am no financial adviser. I am just an ape. Tho I am very confident in GME. I really like the stock. GME to the moon! Fuck evil market makers! This was definitely a dirty move from them! I will fight even harder!

Would appreciate feedback on my speculation. I might be wrong, please tell me if i am.

17,m28jyc,They let the price rise to 350 then they short said stock. Once they’ve shorted at 350 they do minimal manipulation with ladder attacks which then cause stop losses which then causes massive fear which then causes more selling which causes more stop losses which causes halts which causes even more fear. Stock then hits 190 in minutes and they cover resulting in giant profits and shoots the price up to 250 and they let us do the rest of the work again. We are literally feeding them money and the SEC or congress won’t do shit about it and on top of that the volatility creates massive income for the brokers that restricted trading a month ago. Ot sucks to say this but with the whales having so much control it’s a lose/lose why would they EVER cover at 350 when they can cause these sell offs?

92,m28ptu,"I am a college student who, as a patriotic American, paid my taxes for the first time last year (still pissed I didn’t run down to Mexico and live off dollar beers instead of paying that $173.18). AND I WANT MY STIMMYY CHECK.  I didn’t sign up for anything but I assumed since they can send the bill they can send the food. I’m a A1 retard (portfolio of 3 shares GME@ 336, 5 shares amc @21.50) and would rather starve than sell. Hoping anyone has some advice on how I can get big game Joey B’s USD into my pocket so I can put them in my risk free security GME.

If I got my money on time I’d have turned it into an estimated $42,690. Life changing money. For now I just want that 2K.

Sincerely,

Any advice, tips or explanation on how this works would be appreciated.

Also what are some good apps for trading in Europe? since M1 finance isn't an option here...
