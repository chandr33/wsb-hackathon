I‚Äôm looking into the numbers and just from what I‚Äôve been seeing

Important notes from balance sheet.

Stockholder equity is double what it was in 2018, debt to equity ratio is 0.55 so that‚Äôs pretty ok I think??!üëç 

Retained earnings are positive

Cash flow notes 

Operational cash flow is 1/4 what it was in 2019 

Net income from continuing operations is down 700,000$ from 2019

Financing cash flow is down from 7.9M to 1.5M from 2019 

Investing cash flow is up from 7.2M to 9.6M from 2019 

Summary notes: this seems like a retro stock that is breaking into the online alternative currency market(can‚Äôt use the C word??), their partner decentral games has had a solid stock rise from its conception in 2019, what worries me is the low cash flow numbers.

OK, UNFI is the biggest food wholesaler in the US. They're currently at $30.97/share (earnings tomorrow AM). Back in 2015 they peaked at $83.04. Then they nose dived because $AMZN bought Whole Foods $WFD and everyone thought Amazon was going to replace UNFI and self-supply. 

Weellll turns out food logistics is pretty fucking complicated. Whole Foods has used UNFI as their primary distributor for years and extended their contract with UNFI last week through 2027:
https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/unfi-re-ups-primary-distribution-pact-whole-foods

The other reason the stock was beat down was that $UNFI bought SuperValu (grocery chain) which came with some baggage, mainly union pension requirements. 

I'm taking from DOMO Capital's Seeking Alpha a little bit, but from 2014-18 SuperValu traded at avg 7 EV/EBITDA and UNFI traded at avg 11 EV/EBITDA and somehow when UNFI buys SuperValu they go down to a 5.78 EV/EBITDA? Most mergers increase stock price, but what do I know I'm actually a gorilla. 

Grocery revenues continue to be up from the pandemic, so an earnings beat tomorrow is likely. 

On top of that, 85% of outstanding UNFI shares are owned by institutions and it's heavily shorted. 
Float = 51,210,000
Shares shorted = 12,280,000
Shares that aren't insider/institutionally owned = 6,298,830
