1,m1fnys,"Hi all, I’m very very new to the stock game (please be gentle) and looking for a little advice about the Atari casino, Atari stock

I’m looking into the numbers and just from what I’ve been seeing

Important notes from balance sheet.

Stockholder equity is double what it was in 2018, debt to equity ratio is 0.55 so that’s pretty ok I think??!👍 

Retained earnings are positive

Cash flow notes 

Operational cash flow is 1/4 what it was in 2019 

Net income from continuing operations is down 700,000$ from 2019

Financing cash flow is down from 7.9M to 1.5M from 2019 

Investing cash flow is up from 7.2M to 9.6M from 2019 

Summary notes: this seems like a retro stock that is breaking into the online alternative currency market(can’t use the C word??), their partner decentral games has had a solid stock rise from its conception in 2019, what worries me is the low cash flow numbers. Are they’re any important facts or figures that I’m missing that I should include in the future?! Thank you all for your time and have a wonderful day!",Atari Casnio,1.0,1615322221,shattershield113

Now that’s that there’s 8M people here, it seems to be a source of immense toxicity.  I’ve talked to a few people called out in these posts. It seems when these posts go up, people are direct messaging the person who needs to act and telling them to kill themselves, making racial slurs, threatening them with real life threats, or being immensely toxic in other ways.  This leads to people are deleting accounts instead of following through. It’s ban until paid... not ban and real life threats until paid.  

Pming hate to the debtor doesn’t encourage them to follow through.  It encourages them to delete the old account, make a new one, and start over.

OK, UNFI is the biggest food wholesaler in the US. They're currently at $30.97/share (earnings tomorrow AM). Back in 2015 they peaked at $83.04. Then they nose dived because $AMZN bought Whole Foods $WFD and everyone thought Amazon was going to replace UNFI and self-supply. 

Weellll turns out food logistics is pretty fucking complicated. Whole Foods has used UNFI as their primary distributor for years and extended their contract with UNFI last week through 2027:
https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/unfi-re-ups-primary-distribution-pact-whole-foods

The other reason the stock was beat down was that $UNFI bought SuperValu (grocery chain) which came with some baggage, mainly union pension requirements. 

I'm taking from DOMO Capital's Seeking Alpha a little bit, but from 2014-18 SuperValu traded at avg 7 EV/EBITDA and UNFI traded at avg 11 EV/EBITDA and somehow when UNFI buys SuperValu they go down to a 5.78 EV/EBITDA? Most mergers increase stock price, but what do I know I'm actually a gorilla. 

Grocery revenues continue to be up from the pandemic, so an earnings beat tomorrow is likely. 

On top of that, 85% of outstanding UNFI shares are owned by institutions and it's heavily shorted. 
Float = 51,210,000
Shares shorted = 12,280,000
Shares that aren't insider/institutionally owned = 6,298,830
