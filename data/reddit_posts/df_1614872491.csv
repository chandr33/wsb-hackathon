34,lxnh3p,"Imma keep this short(no pun intended) but sweet. Keep in mind I'm an idiot and this is only speculative. 

For every option bought or sold, someone makes the other side of that trade. Whatever market ""maker"" takes on the risk for someone else opening a position in options contracts  needs to delta hedge their books to keep themselves neutral in the name. If your mind hasn't contorted into a pretzel yet, stay with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hedge fund-A buys 100 contracts of Mar19 $2 Puts at .04. Hedge fund or market maker B(from here on I'll just call them MM-B) is now stuck with 100 short puts which they are responsible for. MM-B cannot allow the potential risk in those contracts to incur losses(\*should GME hit that strike by expiry), as such they go out into the open market and short shares equivalent to the negative delta value of the options contract in this case a fraction of a cent but for simplicity's sake lets call that .01. 

&amp;#x200B;

HF-A has spent $400 to create 100 shares of artificial selling in GME. They aren't shorting the stock anymore, they're forcing MM-B to delta hedge and suppress price in the process. 

&amp;#x200B;

The inverse is also true. For instance on Jan 29th the fabled $800 strike options were written, likely naked short by those with short positions in the name (HF-A) right before trading restrictions were put in place. Curious. MM-B now is long farrrr OTM Calls and need to delta hedge that position by, yet again, shorting shares equal to the delta value in the open market. 

&amp;#x200B;

This portion I'm likely wrong about, but from what I can see, about $40 million went into an ITM call sweep yesterday which in turn drove price up for a time. I believe this was in direct response to bears forcing other market entities to take opposing positions. It was someone saying to HF-A ""enough, stop making us do more work than we have to""

&amp;#x200B;

You might be wondering about now, why does this matter? is this a bull or bear argument being made here? 

It's neither. The Oi of any given strike means fuck-all at the end of the day because the majority of contracts are going to $0 regardless. I'm just trying to frame some of the heavy put and call buying we've seen in what I believe to be the most candid way I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's more likely these are being bought and sold to suppress price into a range in which the market makers selling premium will collect on all the contracts you apes have bought for Mar 19th 2021. :)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this is that it's turned GME into a powder keg.. SHOULD the impossible happen and price breaks free into either direction, volatility is going to be insane. You have gamma squeezes set up in both directions, which makes me believe price is all the more likely to be defended in the $80-$130 range through Mar 19. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway that's just my take. Don't listen to me. I am not financial advice. thx

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; The open interest in any give contract doesn't really mean shit at the end of the day. You guys sounds like complete fucking idiots discussing Oi like it's the holy grail.

63,lxnkuo,"I think Revlon (NYSE: REV) is a deep value stock that could pop for big gains (2x-10x) over the next year. Here’s why:
1) It’s going to destroy earnings expectations
2) Actual increases in value due to reopening
3) Citibank screwup litigation
4) Low Float + high short interest

Reopening + earnings: 
The company is going to experience significant natural growth in revenue just because of things opening back up. People stopped wearing makeup because of the pandemic. It’s kind of a pain and there’s just no point if no one is going to see you. The flip side is plenty of people haven’t made significant cosmetics purchases in over a year. I helped my girlfriend clear out a bunch of her old makeup stuff that had dried up and gone bad. When things reopen there’s going to be significant pent up demand for new product. Revlons competitors and vendors are increasing their guidance targets as they see surprisingly good sales. Also informally Ive seen the department store at the mall increase its general staff in the cosmetics section. I’ve seen more people there recently and I think the staffing thing is a good confirmation that the people with the data agree. I think there’s a shot Revlon destroys earnings expectations. The stock has been creeping up over the last few days based on expectations that they are going to release a monster earnings report soon. 
For some reason I can’t seem to link images but all the technical indicators also show the stock is poised to rocket up. 

Even if it doesn’t destroy earnings, the stock is still trading at a 50% discount to it’s pre-Covid prices. Time will make me right. Theres 2x-3x upside if it reaches pre Covid highs just from normal business. Most other stocks have jumped up over Covid. Tesla is up like 10x from last March. Even many oil and gas stocks are creeping up to their 52 week highs. This is one of the few chances to buy at a discount stock that will see guaranteed significant reopening perks. 

Why Revlon over other cosmetic companies:

Bank screwup: Citibank majorly screwed up last august when it accidentally wired almost a billion dollars (for a company with &lt;1 billion market cap) to revlons creditors. Those funds have been tied up in litigation as Citibank is trying to get the money back. A judge just this  week ruled that Citibank can’t get the money back. It’s going to be appealed up, but that’s not a good sign for citibank at all. 

Debt restructuring: Revlon was proactive and used the pandemic to restructure its debt with its debt holders. Thanks to the restructuring and the Citibank screwup the company is in a decent debt position. 

Low Float + short interest:
85% percent of the stock is owned by one guy: Mcandrews and Forbes which is a holding company for Ron Perelman. It has a small $650 million dollar market cap, and most of that stock is unavailable for shorts to use. It also has a 29% of float short interest on most websites but in reality the short interest is like 100% of available stocks. One really interesting fact is that the short percentage has dropped from +50% of float. A sign that plenty of the biggest doubters are bullish on the stock. 

TLDR: don’t like how all your stocks have been red for the last week? Buy Revlon which has been killing it over the last week based on earnings rumors. 

I have 80 shares and I’m adding more.
