4,m34fwp,I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what I want to do with my life. I started investing a lot of my time in the stock market and am realizing that some people don’t see the investments I make in a good light. I’ve changed my thinking we’re instead of save money I want to make money. It seems everywhere I turn there are people who are just being as crabby as possible with money and never want it to go anywhere. But if you never use your money to make money and never take risks you can’t ever get more money. You will just end up with the money you always have. I know this might sound stupid but it’s almost like a video game. In the video game you aren’t crabby with your currency because you want to be able to have unlimited currency at some point. I think money’s the same way. If you take risks and act like what you have is not much and think “I need to be up there with the big boys.” Then you can make these “risky” type of plays. Because at the end of the day I don’t want to do what the people who also haven’t beat the game are telling me. I want to beat the game and it seems like everyone around me just wants to remain in the game until it ends. So I was hoping that maybe some people on here are under the same mindset because I want to be around people with my same aspirations. I’m not saying that what I think is better than other but it is what I want to do and I would like to be around others of the same.

I’ve read a few ideas you guys have that really could be addressed, such as the $25k day trading pattern minimum, that often leaves us in bad spots because we don’t want the 90 day lockout. 

Also, an obvious one is the faster settling of trades.

I for one am not real concerned about the payment flow process that eliminates the commission on trades, as I think far too many questions and time was taken in the last hearing on that.

23,m34j47,"Hi cock suckers and carpet munchers. We’ve all been hearing about the recovery plays in oil, infrastructure, casinos, restaurants and so on. The one I have not been hearing about as much is the big recovery as it relates to the agriculture stonks. Figured I would give you all a few more ideas to chew on. 

The last few years have been absolute shit for farmers, with many of them going bankrupt or barely scraping buy. Some of this is due to poor environmental conditions, some of it was trade war related, and the pandemic compounded all of those already existing problems. 

Where we are now - shit is getting back on track. A lot of this has to do with China and their need to rebuild their pork population. For those who don’t know, Chinese pigs got fucked by a quiet pandemic in 2019 - African Swine Fever. This causes them to buy a lot of soybeans and corn to feed all those fuckin pigs, sending the futures flying. We had a corn gang a little while ago, but this is now spreading to the rest of the farm. 

USDA is projecting a record number of acres to be planted this year in response to the demand, and with the Chinese showing no signs of slowing down, in addition to the volatile weather wiping out crops at random, farmers need to keep production higher as well. China is essentially back in full force post pandemic, and the US is just really starting to see the first signs of normalcy. This only adds to the demand and for different kinds of crops. 

On a separate note, there is a rediscovery of the outdoors and personal farming has been taking off. The booming weed industry can also give the general farming industry a boost as that will require all of the same inputs. 

Things like farming equipment, fertilizers, etc. are in high demand. There isn’t one specific way to play this so I will list a few solid names from each category. Some of these stocks have run up, but let’s be real - what fucking hasn’t at this point? This is a cyclical boom in all things farming that can last for a very long time.

Positions- 

My personal position is selling MOS puts, because I hate sucking theta dick with my butt and there have been extremely bullish options flow/high liquidity in the chain. 

Equipment - DE, CAT, AGCO, RAVN (also loved by cathie bae)

Fertilizers/chemicals - BG, MOS, NTR, CTVA, SMG, CF

General - ADM, DBA (don’t love DBA as a futures based ETF for reasons beyond the scope of the post, but you can see why with a simple search)

Dramatically increased issues with China, weaker recovery than expected, more volatile weather than is typically expected are factors that can hurt this overall play. Oh yea, almost forgot 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙.",Farm Gang,1.0,1615507549,doublemctwist1260

🚀🚀🚀: The market for services like Slack is emerging, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. 
As a result, Slack principally competes against collaboration and communication tools and products from 
established vendors, such as Microsoft; productivity tool and email providers, such as Google; unified 
communications providers, such as Cisco; and consumer application companies that have entered the 
business software market, such as Facebook. It also competes with smaller companies that offer niche or 
point products that attempt to address certain problems that Slack addresses. These smaller companies 
include companies that specialize in voice or video communication, instant messaging, email filtering, and 
email inbox organization, business workflows, team-based collaboration, intranet creation and 
maintenance, and other functionality.



🚀🚀🚀: In September 2018, Slack completed its acquisition of Astro Technology 
Inc. for $43.3 million in cash. Astro created Astrobot, a Slack app that uses integrates email and calendars 
directly into the chat platform, while also using artificial intelligence to reduce inbox clutter. 



🚀🚀🚀: Revenue increased 57.4% in FY 20 (Jan.) following 81.6% growth in FY 19. The increase 
in revenue was primarily due to expansion within its existing Paid Customers, as reflected by its Net Dollar 
Retention Rate of 132% as of January 31, 2020, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as the number of 
Paid Customers increased by 25%. As of January 31, 2020, Slack had $768.6 million in total cash and short-
term investments with no long-term debt.



🚀🚀🚀 Slack is a leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align 
their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade 
environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business 
technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and 
services, and find the information they need to do their best work.
Slack has both a self-service offering and a direct sales force to address customers who do not want to buy 
through the self-serve model or who need the additional capabilities of its enterprise products. Slack offers 
four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of its users: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. 
Enterprise Grid allows paid customers to create and manage an unlimited set of connected workspaces and 
channels, search across multiple workspaces, access centralized controls, and integrate with third-party e-
Discovery and data loss prevention tools to help meet security and compliance requirements. As of January 
31, 2020, Slack had more than 660,000 organizations with three or more users, comprised of more than 
550,000 organizations on its Free subscription plan and more than 110,000 paid customers. The number of 
organizations on Slack is highly diversified, and during the years ended January 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, 
no Paid Customer accounted for more than 3% of revenue.",$WORK from 🏡 favorite Slack is set to 🚀,1.0,1615507851,dankantspelle

I think there's a strong emotional appeal being made to people here as well. Look how they rally up your emotions, making it seem like it's everyone vs. the hedge funds or the 99% vs the 1%. I do think there's some truth to this, but it mostly feels like people are being emotionally manipulated for someone else's profit. Look at how much people are using this new sense of community to make you feel like you belong, if only you buy and hold the stock.

I love everyone here, but I'm worried about more people buying into GME and losing their money. The people who are going to suffer most when GME crashes are going to be the people of WSB, but the ones who bought in at the wrong time. The hedge funds won't suffer because they're not people, and the people working at them won't suffer either because we know they're already well off.

Before this stock was chosen as the official meme stock, remember how everyone used to make fun of GameStop? I think I've heard at least a thousand jokes about how people trade in hundreds of dollars for games only to get 25 cents in GameStop credit. I think one reason it's such a good stock is because everyone already knows about the company, especially with all young people who play video games on Reddit.

Tomorrow is going to be a good indicator on whether or not the Tech market is rebounding to its year long trend, or continuing to fall. If we see a good day, or just a light sell-off, I think we may have more clear skies ahead. Since there’s a lot of unknowns though. we’re going to stick with a strong growth stock that isn’t all that inflated. 

For those of you who didn’t sell XLE or ERX today, don’t stress, it’s still a strong position that I’m holding. If oil rises or holds tonight, think there’s a good chance XLE see’s a strong day tomorrow or early next week 

Now regarding the free money with JD. It’s time to buy the dip on this. I’m recommending ITM calls [75-85 strike] expiring late April. This is just my recommendation for a good combination of upside potential and risk control. This is also a great company for leaps or stock. Hoping for a down day tomorrow to swoop up some calls. 

JD is the sleeper E-Commerce giant of China. (Though it has a reach in many markets) Most people know it’s competitor Alibaba, but I can assure you, JD is a fucking Titan. They are on-track to taking a lot of market share from Alibaba in a densely populated market. 

JD has the best optimized supply chain in China’s E-Commerce market. They’ve spent a lot more time the past decade mastering the supply chain prior to pushing for growth, but I assure you that growth is here. JD has a number of subsidiaries, they all see huge growth, and most importantly they all make money. Alibaba posts a number of losses with its failed or poor performing subsidiaries, and will never overtake JD on supply chain performance. The fact they perform so well, and have entered both new and innovative markets and succeeded, just shows the strength of their management and future. 

I track a lot of institutional purchase points on stocks. The most recent filings show the 80-90 point range on JD as a major purchasing point. We also saw much less of a sell off on some of the final days the S&amp;P posted major losses once in this range, further validating the price floor. 

JD is trading below all targets, and has strong institutional backing. 

JD just posted Q4 results, and as always at open we say a unprecedented sell-off this morning. This has become a regular thing for some unknown reason, which is why I don’t ever hold through earnings. It’s a gamble with no logic these days. I do look for these post-earnings drops in solid companies though, because they provide great buy points. JD beat expectations in all categories for Q4. JD’s revenue is up over 30% from last year to 34 Billion this quarter. I straight up laugh reading through their earning calls, it’s fucking unreal how much growth they see from a financial and user activity standpoint. 

A lot of analysts love saying how it’s just the CV-19 situation that has primarily driven its growth, and that afterwards a large portion of this growth will fall off. They’re fucking idiots. The market in China is huge, we might see a slight drawback, but you don’t stop this type of growth, especially in the Chinese market. It’s just now becoming normal for the lower class in China to have cellphones, opening up a huge market, and the entire country knows who JD is, including the poors and the olds. Want to know why? JD was used by the Chinese government to distribute aid through their applications and services. It’s was essentially a free, government endorsed, country wide PR and marketing opportunity that no ad could ever beat. It also targets the market they want to reach. Can’t make this shit up. 

Have fun with your free money. 

Notes for comments: I don’t provide sell points. The longer you hold, the more risk you take on. The expiration is for risk control only, it’s not the date I’m recommending to sell.","FMA [9]: JD.Com ($JD) - ITM [75-85] Strike Call, EXP 4/23",1.0,1615507991,TheRedditRef

In the past 29 trading days, there were six closes resulted in whole numbers. These whole number closing days only started after **January 28th**, the day many brokers started placing restrictions on trading of meme stocks.

Going back two years in history, GME only closed in whole number **once** on October 23rd, 2020 at $15. In two years leading up to January 28th, 2021, the probability of close price resulting in whole number is 0.14%, it can be explained away as a random event.

However, 6 closes in 29 days is 20.7% in probability (&gt;5%). You can no longer explain that with null hypothesis, that means **it was not random** and we are seeing a **statistically significant** event.

Now, maybe I'm a couple crayons short of two full nostrils, but I watched the TED talk on this company, and was sold purely on what their company IS:

[https://cubicfarms.com/video-this-ag-tech-will-change-the-way-produce-is-grown-worldwide-dave-dinesen-tedxchilliwack/](https://cubicfarms.com/video-this-ag-tech-will-change-the-way-produce-is-grown-worldwide-dave-dinesen-tedxchilliwack/)

&amp;#x200B;

That's the video itself, here's their website:

[https://cubicfarms.com/](https://cubicfarms.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

We've got a company who can create CLEAN &amp; PERFECT vegetation with a near perfect germination ratio. They do it in large pods that look like shipping containers. Head of lettuce takes 16L of water to grow outdoors. These containers only require 1.

I'm at work, and I'm tired, and I've never actually posted on reddit before, but I'd really love to know what you guys think. They were interviewed on Bloomberg radio not long ago, and they are showing mass growth &amp; profit (this is part of my tiredness, their link shows financials), and their growth for 2021 is massive also.

Meat Eater? They've got solutions for us too. They can mass grow clean feed for livestock, and include better nutrition. Reduces carbon foot print from growing livestock!

Every single part of this company checks out to me, but I'm scratching my head why it hasn't made it to anyone's radar. There a reason?

85,m34xfz,"Jim Cramer is not just a clown. He is a villainous shill and crappy stock picker to boot.

Here’s an experiment you can run for yourself to get a feel for Jim Cramer’s track record:

1. Go to [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/mad-money](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/mad-money)
2. Scroll down to the stock screener.
3. **Set the “Showdate:” to “All”.**
4. Enter any stock symbol into the search box and click ""search"" (and then click ""Show All"" near the bottom if necessary).
5. Repeat step 4 to look up other tickers.

I would estimate that with 90-95% of the stocks you look up, you will notice that he gives buy recommendations (the double-green up-arrows) when a stock is near its top, and he gives sell recommendations (the double-red down-arrows) when a stock is near its bottom.

Basically, he just pumps stocks that are currently hot and popular, and craps on stocks that aren’t. It’s momentum investing, pretty much. His buy/sell recommendations assume companies/stocks that are doing well at the moment will only get better, and companies/stocks going through a big slump at the moment will only get worse. With his picks, you either:

1. Buy high, and then sell low, OR
2. Buy high, then hold (or buy more) higher, and then eventually sell low once the company/stock goes into a big slump.

TL;DR – Jim Cramer’s stock picks = buy high, sell low.",Jim Cramer’s stock picks suck. Here’s how you can check for yourself…,1.0,1615508732,VotedOut

Debit spread positions with GME

3/12 235/250

3/19 195/200

3/19 240/250

4/23 200/205

1/20/2023 40/60

Best case scenario these all expire and I make money. Here is my concern:

GME is extremely volatile, and I'm worried if I get my short position executed and the underline drops I will be left with life crippling debt.

I am trading on Robinhood and there is no ability to close these positions out unless I manually close the short leg first, But I don't have $25k to close out these shorts.

I have contacted Robinhood and asked them to close all positions immediately but have received no response.

I'm fine losing my initial investment, I just don't know how to get out of this.

Can they come after me for big losses, am I in trouble or is the only capital at stake the debit I paid to initiate the spread?

Alright, hear me out. Let's assume that we do rocket. We are reaching ~800 to ∞ (lol). Lots of people will be selling their stock which could lead to the value of the stock to plummet. Then you could possibly make a profit. Right? Or am I miss understanding how call options work. I have been trying to educate myself on how the stock market works ever since I heard of GME.

Similarly if you buy now then assume that it will go up and it does you make a profit assuming that the stock goes up enough to cover your ass right?
