73,lwxiye,"You've probably seen how [$RKT shares exploded higher due to an epic squeeze.](https://mainstbets.com/rocket-companies-nyse-rkt-stock/) A lot of traders have been looking for a sympathy play, and $UWMC comes to mind (formerly known as GHIV), another mortgage broker.

However, after the deSPACing, the stock got rocked, but now it's starting to run higher. Of course, this actually makes sense. There are multiple catalysts on the table. Not only is there an upcoming special dividend, similar to $RKT, but there are 102M shares floating. In other words, there's not a whole lot of supply for everyday traders.

When it comes to $UWMC, it's actually a profitable company and with about a $16B market cap at the time of this writing, it's eligible for index additions. $UWMC is eligible to be included in the Russell indices, as more than 5% of the company's total shares is in the free float. Moreover, $UWMC can also qualify to be included in the S&amp;P 500.

This potential demand and relatively low supply can cause this stock to get to $20+. The company also explosive earnings, and the dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to [shareholders of record as of the close on March 10.](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-UWMs-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results-1.37-Billion-4Q20-Net-Income-and-Declares-First-Regular-Quarterly-Dividend-of-0.10-per-share/default.aspx)
