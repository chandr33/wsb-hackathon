Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. 

I’m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. 

**Part I - Bull cases:**

**SPY**

Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f

**Bull Scenario A:**

SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we’re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won’t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. 

**Bull Scenario B:**

No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. 

Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today’s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.

Anyway,

$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. 

Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I’m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term 🌈🐻. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. 

**VIX**

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b

**QQQ**

I think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. 

**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**

I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil.
