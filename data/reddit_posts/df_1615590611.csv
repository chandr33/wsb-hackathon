6,m3tp9c,"Alright apes, first off solid fucking week.  Stg my chest got tight as fuck and my asshole puckered quite a bit during that massive dump on Wednesday but 👐🏼💎 were exercised and with the help of friendly 🐳🐋‘s 🦍🦧🐒‘s continued on their trajectory for Alpha Centauri. 🚀🌌

Now to the topic at hand. I am retarded and do not know exactly what sort of coin needs to be put in the slot to turn into a real catalyst and am hoping a wiser🎓🦍🦧🐒’s might have an opinion on this matter.

Lets start with the amount of degenerates on WSB: 9.5 million

Now this might be low or high but lets say roughly a third of members like the stock so 9,500,000x.33

Gives us 3,135,000

Not all apes will get stimmy though, some don’t live in the states, some might be delayed, some might be too rich, and some might not be willing to yolo their buyden 💵 so lets say a quarter of that third is able or willing to add fuel to the rocket 3,135,000x.25

Gives us 783,750

Just above 3/4 of a million 🦍🦧🐒

BUT not all primates can or will be willing to drop the 14hundo but some will so lets say an average of 900 across the board 783,750x900

Gives us $705,475,000

This number could be low but I feel like it is a conservative estimate and don’t want to overestimate and sound even more retarded.  

What would the effects of this kind of ⛽️ be, is it the catalyst we need, could the friendly 🐳🐋 see it as the signal to breech and spray their own 💵 out of their blowholes.

I am posting in WSB as I honestly believe it meets the criteria in terms of market cap and retail interest. This post may get auto-deleted or mod-deleted. If it disappears just know that’s it’s not of my fact. I’ve been covering Canoo for a few months so check my post history if you need. 

**Context:** Canoo released the presentation of its new truck on March 11th (YouTube, Instagram etc.). A great new catalyst which was covered by multiple media. Price action went rapidly up after the stock been hammered below $10 on the recent tech growth correction. 

**Options context:** For the last couple of weeks I have noticed that put/call ratio was **massively** skewed towards calls volume i.e. I’m talking near 10 to 1 every single day. Option interest also much bigger on calls side. Although the price of the IV was relatively “cheap” around 100% (for a new public company with long duration growth). 

**Weekly price increase:** The stock went from $11 on Monday until exactly $16.00 today... until something funny happened... [weekly graph](https://ibb.co/Wfhtwm9)

**What I believe happened:** Some big money was too short on the stock that started running way too fast for a mispriced implied volatility of just 100%. The heat intensified and people were more than ever buying calls (like 90% 95% of options volume were calls again). Also these calls are concentrated onto March expiry as there are no weeklies on this name. 

**What I believe they did:** They had to cover their shorts as money was bleeding fast with no sign of any slow down (Canoo was even up 5% PM when all tech growth was in the red). Massive sell wall at 16.00 with more than 100K on the offer. But even after it dropped the stock wanted to moon again and people were still buying calls relentlessly. **They activated the ultra algo** in order to drop the share price as fast and as low as possible in order to trigger stop losses on calls. Specifically on MAR 15CALLS. 

**Evidence:** Look again at the [screenshot.](https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N)

At time 12:59:50 and 12:59:51 you will see that within **one second** big quantities were bought at the lowest prices of the day (0.35 to 0.45) then 3 seconds later it went back up to regular prices and quantities. This is the evidence that someone has triggered a sell off on Canoo stock to trigger stop losses on MAR 15C for the algo to buy absolutely everything it could within 1 second. It happened so fast that you couldn’t even feel it. Only an algo was capable to perform this. I had to dig into time/sales to decipher what happened.

**ELI5** Why buy calls if they are short? HF was about to lose too much money on shorting Canoo a retail darling that wants to moon hard. They couldn’t control the price action anymore. They had to hedge their short by getting long calls and mitigate their potential loss. They scooped more than 1K MAR 15C at around 0.42 average price and within the next few seconds it went back to 0.80 and then minutes later to 1.00. All this happened at plain sight before you had time to blink. Now don’t expect media talking about this kind of stuff. They too busy witch hunting retail. This post may also get censored anyway.

I’ve tried my best to make this a quick and simple post. I’ve explained it at the best of my understanding. Obviously not a recommendation to buy sell hold any security. I shared public data. My interpretations could be erroneous. 

**Bonus S3 short data** on Canoo: 
short interest is $152M
10.33M shares shorted
10.33% of Float
9.37% S3 SI% Float
47.82% fee.
Shares shorted up +1.6 million shares, worth $23 million, +13.3%, last week.

**TLDR** HF got caught asleep at the wheel shorting Canoo. Retail likes it too much and wanna moon. They had to buy next week calls ASAP and as cheap as possible. Used algo ultra fast. One second later: thank you very much for cheap calls.",Canoo was algo attacked today probably to cover shorts,1.0,1615590699,Rivaaal

It seems to me to be a company with good prospects, leadership and severely undervalued currently. I barely see it talked about compared to stupid biotech meme stocks or cannabis stocks with zero legitimate catalysts. 

Obviously this isn’t financial advice, do your own research before investing in any company, I just see it as an interesting opportunity related to covid but not from a vaccine angle. 

Discussion greatly appreciated if you think it’s a dud. 

-The company has a diversified portfolio consisting of two covid testing labs in New York and New Jersey with a capacity for 60,000 tests a day. The CEO recently highlighted that their aim at the moment is to reach 5,000 tests a day by the end of the quarter, which he figures will provide $52Mn in earnings on top of current regular earnings of $15Mn from over the counter Pharma sales. 

-2 analysts cover PRPH with a median EOY PT of 22.5, its currently sitting at around $9.50. 

- Every hurdle that PRPH have faced in terms of ramping up production and gaining covid test customers has been passed ahead of time, with the CEO confident that by the end of the quarter the company will be in position to provide a special dividend. I wager anyone to show me a random BioNano hype stock that is in that position.

- CEO plans to diversify lab spaces past COVID.

- Low withstanding share count

- CEO is experienced at creating diverse and profitable companies, strong leadership and vision for change.
