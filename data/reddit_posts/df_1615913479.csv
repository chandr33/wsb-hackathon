I just want to let you know I am going down or up with all of you. I have faith in the DD, TA, Daily Discussions, MEMEs and the totally erection inducing LOSS, GAINS &amp; YOLOs  and the straight up CONVICTION you all have because of a simple rule: DYOR. 

I thank each and everyone of you, it is time I beg for money on the streets to get by till I get back on my feet and do it all over again...or shoot blasting through the galaxy and past the moon till we get to static where nothing moves, not time nor space...just gains.

In short, I love you guys and ""I like the stock""!!!

Cleveland Cliffs is a one of the largest vertically integrated iron ore companies in the US. This means that they own the mines, blast furnaces etc. 

Bull Case:

Over the summer China introduced a new infrastructure stimulus plan in an attempt to recover from the pandemic. This caused steel prices to skyrocket past pre covid levels.

[Steel Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/819cwtmx3fn61.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a76b8d5fd09d063638758f97faae988593f79419)

Most of the steel they used would be from Chinese manufacturers but this has eaten into the global steel supply raising prices everywhere.

Now US president Joe Biden plans on unveiling a US infrastructure stimulus bill. Potential as large as $2 trillion says Goldman Sachs ([link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/03/01/bidens-infrastructure-bill-could-be-2-trillion-behemoth-heres-what-goldman-sachs-is-expecting/?sh=aa7565f6071e)). Biden has also introduced a buy American mandate for government projects. As one of the largest steel producers in America I think CLF stands to benefit enormously from this and with steel prices already above pre covid levels I think we could see a large increase in profit for CLF.

CLF uses blast furnaces which although less efficient than EAF furnaces they are better when the steel market as at highs because they can produce way more. 

Although I am not really a fan of analyst ratings is $19.50 for the stock which is a 16% increase from its current levels.

Bear Case:

CLF has embarked on a large expansion through multiple acquisitions. This has allowed it to become a vertically integrated but as also come with a large price tag.

Currently because of this they have $5.85 billion in long term debt which is substantial especially if steel prices fall off.

Balance Sheet: ([link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLF/financials/annual/balance-sheet))

The price is most of the time dropping today, but on minimal volume. And every time when there's even a slight a spike in volume (&gt;2k), the price explodes. What does this mean? That nobody is actually selling at that price point! Whenever someone buys bulk, the shares which are available at the shown price are just enough for a small fractire of that order, so the price goes up quite a bit, just tp drop on minimal volume again. DON'T TRUST THIS!  
Your shares are worth more than what is shown to you, much more. And you shpuld know that, and today's movement is convincing me once again that we're not even on the launch pad yet!

This company is currently only $3.95 Per share and the options are dirt cheap, before the crash in 2020 this stock was trading at $17.99. Its currently making a steady comeback and has a HUGE upside. 

To start \[ 51.33% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors. \]

This is HUGE! Blackrock and all the big names have large stakes!

Not only that Shorts are starting to cover because they know this is going up!

2021 is about to be a great year for stocks overall with the stimulus and things returning to norms. 

They are having a stock holders meeting May 4th.. (insert pun) which should overall be good for the company and investors. 

I expect companies like this are going to be making great comebacks. 

Mortgage companies are at an all time low due to Covid.

Property always goes up and Morgages are always needed.
