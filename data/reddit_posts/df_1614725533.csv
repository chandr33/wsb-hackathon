Anywho i put on a sweater, or jacket whatever they are called, sweatshirt ? mmm. the 10 second walk turned into a 20 second shuffle as the heavy rain kept on slapping me everywhere. I enter the building soaking wet. I place my order for like 10 munchkins, but since it was already somewhat late and they were throwing away all the unused food, the guy gave me like 50 freaking munchkins for like $5. shit was insane. I can only assume it was 50 because i have ordered a 25 pack to share and what not, and it was nowhere near this amount.

70,lwf0md,"This is not financial advice and neither do you have to listen to my opinion. I’m just expressing myself...

With that being said, I honestly don’t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting, it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it’s worth investing in, maybe not.

I personally do not have a position in RKT and I won’t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I’m still -45% but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. 

Now back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn’t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would’ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. 

At the end, it’s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can’t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you’ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There’s no telling when it will end. But when it does it’ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.

Of course you do not have to listen to me. I don’t even know what I’m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes.

79,lwf1yi,"Would/should AAPL Buy ZNGA? How about SNAP? Or Facebook?

Zynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They’ve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they’re compared to competitors they’re undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). 

I’ve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I’ve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move.  However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV.

There is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS?  To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. 

On mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into.
