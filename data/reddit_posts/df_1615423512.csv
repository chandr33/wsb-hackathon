With cybersecurity needs increasing by the day this company is on the forefront of email security. With plans to utilize et 2.0 their security is coming into the new age very well. I feel they are extremely undervalued at this point. Consistantly gaining more clients. It just takes them getting a bit more mainstream. Incredible software from everything i have seen being picked up by medical and Legal professionals. easy to use software. Just my thoughts on an under rated and under valued company.

27,m2dtqk,"So a few weeks back I posted a DD for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx\_quest\_diagnostics\_is\_free\_tendies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)

**TL;DR** **so you can get back to $GME memes:** $DGX is the safest double up+ opportunity in the market right now. Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.

............................................................................................................................................................

As is WSB tradition, my one and only concern (a general market downturn) came to fruition shortly after posting the initial DD linked above. So my sincerest apologies for tanking the market over the last couple weeks. I'm now in your debt and, like a Lannister, intend on paying up. Continue reading unless you hate money.

Quest presents a very low risk opportunity to double up at a minimum. No, it probably won't be a 10 bagger, but you'll at least be able to use the tendies to cover your taxes after $GME moons. **So here's part 2 of my $DGX callout (read part 1 first you jackass):**

$DGX has been trading at roughly $11 PE for over 2 weeks now. The share price remains literally FLAT vs pre-Covid February of 2020. Which is hilarious considering:

* All significant competitors are up AT LEAST 20% in that timeframe. Including Labcorp.
* Back to back Qs of record breaking Revenue (50%+ y/y) and EPS (100%+ y/y).
* A plethora of additional reasons from DD part 1 linked above, **including $2B in share buybacks announced and approved for 2021.**

This is practically a ZERO risk trade, which is even more incredible when considering recent market volatility. Since 2006, $DGX has only traded below a PE of 9 once....doing so for a mere 30 days. It has typically traded around 15 PE during that time overall. I know, I know. You're thinking *wtf is this guy rambling about historical PEs for. And he already said they are at 11. And 11 &gt; 9, I think, so WHO CARES?!*

**What if I told you that the EPS guidance given during Q4 guidance puts their diluted TTM EPS at 14.38 through Q2 of 2021?** To put it more simply for the slow kids in the back munching on crayons, if EPS targets are hit, then **$DGX would need to be trading at $144/share to result in a conservative PE of just 10 by Q2.** If they return to 15 PE by serology advancements, acquisitions, base testing rush, and share buybacks, the share price would be $216. Key notes:

* Guidance was only given for first half of 2021. They will beat the top revenue and EPS #s given. They ALWAYS do because this mgmt group is a bunch of sandbagging pricks. They were the kid in school that always said he failed an exam, only to receive a 98 and set the curve for the class. **Rev**: $4.85b to $5.15b. **EPS**: $5.07 to $6.07.
* \^ They. Will. Beat. Both. Top. Numbers. But my 14.38 minimum EPS above uses a conservative $6 projection anyway.
* Additionally, management stated the EPS guidance given does NOT factor in an unprecedented **$2billion authorization of share repurchases, which is a massive amount when you consider 90% of their outstanding shares are owned by institutions.** For context, they seem intent on repurchasing **6x the amount of shares repurchased in 2020.**

The overblown trashbag ""analyst"" concerns remain the same from DD part 1. COVID testing will just disappear over night and Quest's core business will take a while to return.

* COVID faucet is gonna get shut off quickly, eh? Yet in reality, public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through Feb for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)
* Even as COVID testing drops off, it will be offset by massive returns in $DGX base work to pre pandemic levels. Personally, I think there's a strong case to be made for a rapid return in their base business as people catchup on postponed doctor visits and procedures. Small boost from employment screenings as well.
* I've spoken with several Doctor/PA/Nurse friends across 8 different hospitals and they've said that over the past 2 weeks they've seen a dramatic shift in patients. **They are SWAMPED, but not with COVID patients.** This anecdotal reinforces the bullet above. DGX base business is going to return quicker than people think, AND they will still be able to continue a large amount of COVID testing (still happening based on the #s, just less hospital involvement thanks to drive-throughs and other 3rd parties).
* The $1.9T stimulus package includes $50 billion specifically for ""testing and contact tracing"". The bill also references an unspecific amount for serology/analytics/researching viruses.
* Quest also has seen a dramatic uptick in users on their tech platforms: Quest Quanum (provider focused) and MyQuest (patient focused). You can bet they will be able to monetize this data for research too down the road. In this day in age, data is everything.

**Price expectations by end of year. Raises vs part 1 as I've gained more testing/quest data into Q:**

* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown, this baby is a lock.
* Best case - $200

**Positions**

* Sold position (2/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks
* Holding: $50k in shares
* Open: May 21 $125, $130, $140. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Long live GME.

60,m2dydo,"Okay so today was a interesting day for many of our beloved stocks and I have had this thought on my mind since the pickup in memes and the explosion of new members. 

Since I have been apart of this sub I have seen so many countless donations to worthy causes and charities. It warms my heart each and every time one of you guys/girls/retards/autists’ etc post their donation porn. THIS IS WHAT MAKES US BETTER! 

Now let me say in no way is this post a plead for money or a promotion of me and my organizations. This is me sharing what my perspective of how we can do even more. 

I have directed a 501c3 for close to 6 years now. We have for profit organizations that basically help carry the non profit. We have not received grants loans or any type of assistance from local state or national organizations since our inception in 2008. Even though we could qualify well and above for many things we have always chosen to rely on the community and the for profit corporations for when times are tight. We morally have always felt that money is to go where it is needed not desired. 

Now if you have made it this far you are probably asking yourself what in the hell does this have to do with anything. Bare with me. 

Monetary donations and monetary support are such awesome ways to contribute however the more effective and rewarding contribution is your time. 

I have countless volunteers that literally run the show for the non profit. Without them I would physically and mentally not be able to deal nor do all the work that is required. Our volunteer base has allowed us to expand to 3 facilities and be one of the top 501c3s in our field in the nation. 

As much as I Would love to take credit for our success or give credit to my father who founded the organization, all credit goes to the community of volunteers. Wether they came in one time and gave us 1 hour of hard work or they have been with us since 2008 every second and person that has came through our doors and given time have helped us grow and allowed us to continue forward with our work in such a way that would not be possible without them.

So please guys I beg you as someone who heads a 501c3 most all of us need volunteers more so than money. If you are fat with cash from GME or retired from your early TSLA investment. Consider giving time, and if you wanna give money do that too, but I ask everyone to start with time. You will not find a more rewarding and humbling experience then actually working hand in hand with the charity/501c3 that you are passionate about or considering. 

Now this brings me to my last part. If you are considering giving any monetary donations to any organizations I’d advise you to first research your local community and see what’s close. Go visit them see what they do, how they do it, talk with the directors, speak with the volunteers,
And then decide how you would like to help. As much as I love bigger charity’s your local non profits provide real outreach to real people that you can actually see the effects of whatever your investment might be directly into your
Own community. 

Not only beating the HFs give us all baskets of money but it gives us all a opportunity to show the world not only what we do with our millions but what kind of people/community we really are at wsb deep down.

Ever since the taxpayer-funded bailouts in 2008, Wall Street has thrived while most of America either starved or got left behind. During this time, arrogant Wall Street fund managers continuously beat down the average citizen both inside and outside the stock market. Every day millions of citizens just like you are drowning in endless debt and bills while corrupt mainstream media shills pump and dump stocks on a continuous basis while our incompetent politicians have the audacity to accuse us, the people, of market manipulation. 

Today, with GME we can finally put a stop to that. We finally managed to beat them at their own rigged game and what do they do? Backed into a corner, hedge funds decided to have one more go by coordinated the dumping of millions of shares all at once while simultaneously ordering their media lackeys to spread FUD at almost the exact same time it is going on. 

I for one am not f\*cking leaving. 

It is true, retail investors have never faced an enemy as powerful as they, but never before have we been more united in the ideas of fairness, freedom, and democracy.

Comparing Invesco to other REITs in particular,  I can't help but think that it's just lying dormant and about to explode any day now. Here's why:

\- Prior to COVID it was sitting comfortably between $11 and $23 for the past 15 years!

\- If you look back at 2008 you will see a very similar waterfall to what you saw in March when COVID hit, and it took less then a year for an almost complete bounce-back.  If history repeats itself, you're looking at an over 500% growth potential in a year (probably more though.)

\- It traditionally had a dividend yield of around 10-15%; They are currently at 8.5% (and rising)

\- They had some issues paying off their margin, but according to their last earnings report, they've managed to pay off all their debt, and they also exceeded earnings estimates.  They did need to sell off a few properties; not the end of the world though.

\- Are lower mortgage rates detrimental to a REIT??    
I honestly don't know.  Please let me know what you think.  I do know that property values have dropped; that seems like a positive to me.

\- and finally; just overall stability.  I think that $1.95 low right after COVID  was rock bottom. They are a business, they are adapting and making good decisions that are keeping them in the green and continuing to grow.  They only saw a 10% dip during last weeks down market and are currently continuing to hold their upward trend line very nicely. With the market currently going nuts, they have excellent market resistance.

If a $4 share with an 8.5% dividend becomes a $15 share with a 12% dividend;  You're going from $0.34 to $1.80 per share, per year, basically for the rest of your life in the form of dividends.

That's almost a 50% ANNUAL return on investment!

93,m2e209,"What we saw today was perhaps the most blatant example of market manipulation to have ever been witnessed on the U.S stock exchanges. Ever since the taxpayer-funded bailouts in 2008, Wall Street has thrived while most of America either starved or got left behind. During this time, arrogant Wall Street fund managers continuously beat down the average citizen both inside and outside the stock market. Every day millions of citizens just like you are drowning in endless debt and bills while corrupt mainstream media shills pump and dump stocks on a continuous basis while our incompetent politicians have the audacity to accuse us, the people, of market manipulation.

Today, with GME we can finally put a stop to that. We finally managed to beat them at their own rigged game and what do they do? Backed into a corner, hedge funds decided to have one more go by coordinated the dumping of millions of shares all at once while simultaneously ordering their media lackeys to spread FUD at almost the exact same time it is going on.

I for one am not f\*cking leaving.

It is true, retail investors have never faced an enemy as powerful as they, but never before have we been more united in the ideas of fairness, freedom, and democracy.

They can manipulate all they want, but at the end of the day, I just like the stock.
