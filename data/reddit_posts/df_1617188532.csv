25,mh4brl,"Just yesterday I still had faith that the fundamentals of silver would drive the price to new highs, however in the face of some of the most bearish TA I have ever seen, I have had to admit defeat for now. Ape like shiny things but shiny thing on screen only looks red so ape has shorted shiny thing to try make screen green.

I bought in around $27 based off the massive increase in silver demands retail and industry based, the apparent close to defaulting of a number of mints, historical comparison factors, high government borrowing etc etc. Except I bought leveraged, and that just wasn't clever. I do believe silver will squeeze at some point but I can't afford to cover the medium term. So here's why I admitted defeat and accepted silver is going to bottom much lower than I expected. Let's take a look at the chart.

[Silver Chart with 50 and 200 EMA \(ignore weird glitch candle for today\) - BEARISH AF](https://preview.redd.it/jiqma675ncq61.png?width=1720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13ab5cc3e6e5bd5ea19135ca3fb5fd235f33272f)

In the past few weeks silver has trashed its supports with the biggest hitter being the fall of the 200 EMA - and let's not even start on that double top. The next support is the lows at $22. Technically it seems almost impossible silver doesn't test the support here, hence why I have placed a short position at $24.

But what if it breaks $22? Well then it going to go much lower according to the chart - somewhere in the mid teens seems a certainty and maybe it even retests the bottom. If it breaks $22, the uptrend is broken and silver plummets. 

This isn't the end of the world for those holding PSLV or physical silver who intended to flip it. Silver will rebound, almost all the fundamentals mentioned at the beginning will still apply and the pressure from retail buying will takeover if the price drops into the teens. This might even be the catalyst that is needed for a real squeeze as the price becomes more accessible.

So in the short-medium term this looks like a win for the banks. I would rather make money shorting silver so that I can buy hard at lower prices. It seems to me the tide of this manipulated market isn't turning now, but the banks will be greedy as they always have been and when silver drops into the low teens that is when retail buyers will strike back and hurt them with an incredible squeeze.

Note: Potentially silver rebounds but it is going to have to break the 200 EMA and and the 50 EMA now to have any chance of rocketing, this seems sadly very unlikely in the short term. Physical silver may not even drop that much to buy, premiums will increase to maintain the buying price, that is the joy of this ridiculous market.

70,mh51ff,"I just had an epiphany! my next business model is going to be renting money! You pay me 10% a month of whatever you want to borrow. And the rent payments are concluded when the original loan is returned. You borrow $1,000 from me, you pay me $100 a month to use that. Whenever you return that $1,000, rent payments are done. seems pretty legit to me, and people that know how to invest can easily use that borrowed money to make nice gains at the cheap rate of only paying %10 a month.
