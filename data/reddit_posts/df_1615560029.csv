5,m3ix88,"Having observed GME price action lately I’ve become to the conclusion that Citadel has changed sides à la ”If you can’t beat them, join them”. Citadel and it’s proxies are effectively making the market on the stock buying the dips to make sure that the WSB mob keeps on trading on RH app while the stock keeps on rising. Citadel Securities pockets the spread every day which might reach easily 9 figures per day if 80% of the total trading volume happens on RobinHood. 
GME’s collapse on Wed from 350 to 175 was probably due to a technical glitch with Citadel’s proxies which temporarely prohibited them from supporting the stock price. An alternative explanation is that they were able to close their long position and stopped supporting the share price.",GME stock price controlled by Citadel el al.,0.4,1615560103,BlackJackPro21

14,m3ixys,"Hindenburg Research just released [this](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/) today, and the relatively new EV company, [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/), may be eating shit because of it. Despite admitting they are short on $RIDE, it appears the FUD is working. The volume of sales of $RIDE spiked very high just before opening today, pushing the price down.

I'm wondering, has anyone here seen this yet? Any of you long on this company? What do the seasoned investors among you say to this kind of thing? Is a rally justified in the face of such scandal? What kind of reputation does Hindenburg Research have?

Someone is dirty, but who? And what, if anything, can shareholders do to make sure they aren't cheated? I'm relatively new to investing so some perspective would be appreciated.",Hit Piece or Truth?,0.33,1615560172,A_Grey_Dragon

84,m3j7ij,"BFI has some great potential... these micro cap plays that get no coverage are a prime candidate.  


Short term? No idea... long term? They could capture at least half of the market cap value that their competitor Shake Shack offers I would think.

BFI has 120ish stores, Shake Shack has about 270.  


250mm market cap vs 5bn market cap.  


BFIs lack of sales matches that, but their book value multiple does not IMO.  Not to mention Florida is their home-ground so this upcoming earnings should be interesting to look out for.

Martha Stewart recently put on the board is another great move on their part.  


Haven't felt this positive about a stock in a while.
