12,lx4mu4," 

I imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.

In that time period, I watched the ""chip"" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.

My companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an ""Anti Dumping Tax"". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, ""a radioactive"" product.

&gt;***Side Note:***

LG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.

Back in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :

* Production capacity of each factory.
* Daily production numbers of computers.
* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, ""absorbed"" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.
* Mother Nature and her wrath ""overseas"".

The computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.

A few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire ""Technology Sector"", although it did not exist yet.

&gt;**Points:**

* Always ask ""Why"".
* ""Due Diligence"" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.
* In this market, ""What goes down, usually comes up"". Write that down.
* VIVA LA #REDDIT AND FREE TRADE !!",CHIP SHORTTAGE - REAL OR MEMOREX,0.7,1614806345,Puzzleheaded_Web_551

73,lx4v6o,"Lurker just wanting to add a little to the discussion  (excuse not adopting the lingo, I don't post often).

 I'm no financial advisor so don't take my word and such, but I do remember before the GME craze there was a term called rock hands for the people who could stand a beating but still come out on top because their DD was sound. An example I can give to everyone now to understand, is say you bought into GME at 200, averaged down to 90 (when it hovered in the 40s for a week), then sold at 180 when it bounced back. I'd say that was a rock hand play. You came in high, averaged down, then still 2X your money, brovo. (I guess disclaimer, I hold GME and got in way before you). 

I know it's cool now to say paper hand this and paper hand that, but if you ain't making no money or losing a lot of money I'm not sure why you on a betting subreddit. Make big moves but not dumb moves. Not every hand is a diamond hand play, infact a diamond hand play is ultra rare. You gonna find a lot of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x plays rather than the say 10X or more.....Or you might lose it all, who knows. But without a DD you really are a retard and more than likely bout to get your pockets ran. 

But as I said im just a lurker, i'm not trying to sway anyone to buy or sell anything. I'm just reminiscing about the other forgotten hand. Make some money fellas, it's a lot of rock handed plays out there. But keep digging deep until you find that diamond hand play for sure.

Look guys,I think it is actually time to change some things. People keep comparing this time to the previous squeeze but forget that last time we literally had a jump start. We shouldn't forget that maybe, just maybe we wouldn't have even reached 100 without Elon Musk's tweet. Thus last time, Elon  could have initiated the ""mini-squeeze"". This time we can't rely on Elon to tweet something about GameStop to act as a catalyst.

I can't be the only one to see that things are different this time. We literally still have no (verified) explanation why the price suddenly jumped from 40 to over 100 in one day, why everytime we think they are out of shares to borrow the number increases again or why the price is neither going up nor down in the last couple of days.

Maybe to win this war (quite literally a war right now) we need to stop pretending to be fucking stupid. Our biggest strength until now is our unity. And with the whole RKT thing even that is starting to fall apart. That is why I suggest to take things more seriously from now on. I mean we can still be apes, but apes ain't stupid.

We need more people posting good DD's instead of memes, just like last month. I remember scrolling through the Top Threads and the majority was actually smart ass shit. And I'm not saying we should stop posting memes, just start posting more useful stuff.

Conclusion:

The ""ape and retard"" thing used to cover up the fact that we actually knew what we were doing. Maybe that is what brought us this far.
