13,lwhaob,"I’ll start by saying I’m no financial expert or advisor, I am merely a rookie options trader but I’m getting the hang of it. RKT seemed to have flatlined this afternoon around $40. If the $36 strike was the highest available for 3/5 expiry, I think this could be part of the reason why it hit resistance in the low $40’s. 

Here’s why:
People like to buy cheap OTM options. Since the $36 strike was the highest offered strike price for this week, it got expensive for options traders to play. When the stock was $43, that $36 call was trading for upwards of $700 in premium. My guess is this put the options game out of play for a lot of traders and the stock began to lose some momentum.

Why this matters:
On expiration date, all ITM calls have the ability to be exercised, and 100 shares per option owned need to be available for purchase. This generally drives the stock price up, and in turn puts pressure on short sellers to cover. Additionally, the $1.11 dividend will have to be paid by the short sellers if they are still short this Friday.

TL/DR;
If higher strike 3/5 calls are added, RKT 🚀🚀🚀 even more.

I’ve been conducting DD on FDX stonk and talking to people across the country and I think it might be primed to crash. It’s back to 2018 levels in spite of the pandemic boom and I’m hearing the recent clusterf*ck in deliveries (which they blame on “weather”) is a “clear and evident” operational problem, and can’t be resolved as easily as they are stating, and this will affect earnings. (In fact, I’m hearing the input/output deliveries problems are getting worse). Employees are extremely unhappy and the problems have “probably reached the boardroom &amp; the directors are concerned about having to use their officer &amp; director liability insurance.”  Additionally, supposedly mgt has been waging a war in the C-suite with them all pressuring the board to fire the CEO.  “Heads will roll” when earnings are released on March 16 was mentioned. I’m considering buying Mar 19 puts. Is anyone else hearing these “rumors”? Is FDX 🧻 🙌 stonk? (FYI: Not Financial Advice. Don’t buy/sell any investments based on my post.

On down days like today, where you have funds moving out of securities, coupled with an earnings report that has a lack of guidance....you get a stock that is extremely oversold. $TGT is one of those stocks. 

# Earnings

The Good:

* Sales increased 19.8% to $93.6bn from $78.1bn last year.
* Digital sales (including home delivery and in store pickup) increased by 145%
* **Sales growth of more than $15bn...this is more than its total sales growth over the last 11 years combined.** 
* Net earnings increased 33.1% to $4.4bn

The ""Bad""

* $TGT plans to spend $4bn per year remodeling stores, opening new stores and on the supply chain to help with online orders. 

I wouldn't take this as a bad sign, if they're working to improve e-commerce that's a good sign even if there is a vaccine and re-opening...shopping trends change as people who wouldn't normally shop online now understand how convenient it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Apple Partnership Expansion

* Last week Target announced it was building upon its longstanding partnership with Apple to include an ""enhanced Apple shopping experience""...essentially a mini Apple store inside of Target. [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/target-apple-store-experience/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/target-apple-store-experience/)

# Dividend King?

* Target has raised its dividends for 49 years straight.
* Only 27 companies have increased dividends for 50 years straight....Target will be the next, making it a Dividend King.
* Target offers a 1.5% dividend yield...this is in line with other S&amp;P500 stocks

# Data

* $TGT hit a high of $193.58 today before sharply turning downward and hitting a low of $172.17 ending the day down -6.67%. In After Hours $TGT is sitting at $174.6
* Analyst for $TGT have zero sell recommendations with a current price target of $200.81

* If we look at the options volume for today on $TGT there were 2x the calls bought compared to puts. 

*Processing img euc6yo3dopk61...*

# Wrapping it Up

* Target has a lot going for it.
   * Dividends - as volatility remains and the 10yr rises, money will be moving from riskier growth / tech stocks into risk off stocks and stocks with dividends. 
   * Target fits in with the shopping trend changes in e-commerce / e-commerce growth
   * Target fits in with the re-opening narrative as shoppers who want to shop in person, can, and Target will be making the stores better by making investments in improving them. 

# Positions

* I have 100 shares for now, I'll be checking the options pricing tomorrow and looking at potential calls I'll want to buy.

26,lwhcwx,"This sub is getting close to 10 million apes now, and with the influx of traffic from all the shit going on I figured most of you need to hear this.

There was a post recently by u/Aydenn7 that really epitomized the mind boggling dumbassery I'm seeing. He said to hold GME to 100k, and then proceeded to label anyone who had an opposing opinion a shill or a bot.

This sub is not supposed to be a red-arsed chimpanzee circle jerk but that's what it's turning into. Truthfully, Idgaf about your opinions or beliefs or values. I don't care if you worship satan or jerk it to pictures of Pelosi ten times a day or sleep with an Elon Musk body pillow. All I care about here is making money. That's what this sub is about. Solid, factual DD, high-risk bets, and trying desperately to get yachts and lambos while losing our life savings.

Personally, I think the idea that GME will get to 100k is the dumbest shit I've seen in my life. But what do I know? I'm a fucking moron. And the vast majority of you bunga-bunga spouting degens are morons too. I have a better chance of making successful trades throwing my hot shit at a wall with BUY/SELL written on it than I do listening to most of you.

There are a few crease-brained individuals here: the mods, DFV, the people who post solid DD and actually know what the fuck they are talking about. But all of the people telling you to hold, to buy, to do ANYTHING, are not only fucking retards like me, but are retards with THEIR best interests in mind. Not yours.

There is no trust in the stock market. It's me vs you. Anyone who says ""we all win if we all hold ooh wee"" is just waiting to turn around and sell in a fucking second, leaving you holding the bag. Because they are just trying to make money, which is what they should be doing if they're investing.

I don't want this sub to be an echo chamber. Confirmation bias may help you sleep at night, but it also makes you a stupid cunt. Differing opinions are a necessary part of trying to make informed trades. Think GME will hit $1m per share? Cool. Think it'll crash back to $3? Cool too. Post your PROOF or your POSITIONS, or go dip your balls in nitric acid you fucking donkey.

Do your own research, set your own limits, and stop calling people shills or bots if they have something different to say.

I’m a 26 year old male who has been working steadily out of a union hall for 8+ years (highly consistent lucrative work) I own a home, several vehicles with a few notes and have a child on the way. (Highly likly it’s my wife’s boyfriends as we haven’t had sex in 9 months and she’s 6 months pregnant) Through my union I have an annuity as well as a pension and a personal RIRA. I have money saved to the point where I don’t live paycheck to paycheck and then stumbled upon this GME nightmare. (Point being is I’m not gambling with money I can’t afford to lose.) 

So I have watched since the first big gains and it really peaked my interest. I know nothing more about the stock market beyond the basics. That being said I bought in through fidelity 62@ 161 about a week ago. Long story short I’m down two grand or so. I don’t let it consume me I don’t really care...I could have spent it on scratch offs honesty. Anyway...my questions are as follows 

1. Even though I’m all about the dimond hands bullshit. Is gme something to keep up on as a cause or as something actually lucrative? 

2. If I’m looking to dump some more cash in elsewhere, where do you start in a general sense?

In my opinion RKT is a very good attempt at diverting people away from GME. I can agree with most people that RKT may have been under valued due to the recent dividend ; but **is RKT the next GME stock? In my opinion NO.** The key difference to GME is the short position. The CEO alone at RKT owns [1.9 billion shares](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/743306605445251126/816453893160173568/unknown.png) ( [1.9billion 2nd link)](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/insider-activity) while the total available shares is only [115 million](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/institutional-holdings). If you have been following any of the GME DD the short position on **RKT shorts are no where near GME short shorts  (Please some one prove me wrong).**

The only concern I see with RKT is the [option chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RKT/options?p=RKT) for this week and next week ; it's all closing in the money. What does this mean? I'm not sure exactly. But looking at the chain for march 5th I can tell you Puts are currently short roughly -119 million dollars. So every dollar past $34 is just a win for anyone holding common stock. I'm really just interested what other people have to say about entire option chains expire in the money.

First time DD -  Provide any constructive feedback, looking forward to your comments. (Flavour of tendie sauce)

We are in a market shortage for semiconductors and the material to make them.  
The shortage is so bad it is a detriment to production of many other sectors and companies. 

[Ford](https://www.motortrend.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-automotive-ford-f-150/) and [GM](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/gm-extending-plant-shutdowns-at-three-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html) are having trouble keeping up.

GPU and CPU shortages, shortages in the industrial sectors, and most importantly shortage of tendies. That's right if you need tendies, you need to get semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is high and supply is low, so what does that mean? Free trip to the moon with tendies and extra sauce.

# The Good Stuff

  
$ON Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances. 

""Other manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly  line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines and shop  equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave. It even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a  power switch, which are made by $ON.

A new CEO was brought in with tremendous experience in the semiconductor industry (sound familiar?) that has experience growing both revenues and margins at Cypress Semiconductors. **Hassane El-Khoury**; the man, the myth, a new tendie legend. Already a moving force in the semiconductor world, [he was a pointing factor behind the merger of Infineon Technologies and Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the organisation](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/company/cypress-acquisition/) as ""one of the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers"".

I'm a grower and not a show-er, so if you want growth you can actually hear it from me personally. This company is a killer for revenue because they are financially stable and very profitable as is this play.

""The   one thing that sets $ON apart from the rest of the equities on  this   list is that they're not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not  a   company that simply outsources chip production to other people    (overseas) and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in    house.  Matter of fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he    wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.  Which    means when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer money  to   build out US production, they'll have their hands out."" -[u/NrdRage](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)

54,lwhgl7,"I hope this gets read by someone because I invested a lot into WSB and read good DD daily. 

This is about RKT and GME, but mostly RKT info since I know the company well. I trusted them with my literal life savings and no primary source of income....and no stimulus on the way to us middle shlubs class either. I hope you find it useful, and I hope this site isn't strictly for GME because I doubt that was the intent. I hold positions in both companies. Held RKT since $20 on IPO then got railed but shorts for the next 8 months while they had their loser bottom level traders sell covered calls.  I went through weeks of depression watching this stock be fomented for nearly a year. Thank god WSB taught me what fomented meant. 

Is RKT a distraction from GME? Maybe - who knows. I don't care it went up 70% and wsb gave me the courage to stay with it.  I have no idea what to believe on the reddit site anymore because HFs are spending more time diluting wsb DD rather than making good investments. Real quick tangent on that. Like who the fuck shorts 144% of a stock at $2 (GME). Who the fuck shorts RKT, a 30 year successful company who made nearly 1/2 trillion dollars in revenue in 1 year? I digress. I guess were all retards in the end. I mean how stupid do you have to be to short RKT? Like as a true millionaire/billionaire investor, that retail investor used to look up to prior to GME: how fucking stupid can you be? Did you not research anything and just said fuck it, let's short the stock? You might want to start reading some more DD here and get back to the basics for a little bit. Like the CEO LITTERALLY TOLD YOU NOT TO FUCKING SHORT IT you greedy fucks.

This is more about RKT than GME because you should get it by now, fucking hold it until it squeezes again and buy the dip. It's above $100 for a reason. It's because we all like the stock. 

I worked for 4 different mortgage companies, Rocket (Quicken Loans) being one of them, and they still hold a place in my heart. If I stayed there I would probably have hella option incentives as an Executive Banker retention bonus because they are that good to their employees. Today I made a fuck ton of cash and still hold over 50k in my position - it's an easy stock to hold...it's a good company, and finally word is getting out about it after watching shorts kept it sideways since fucking 09/2020. Just more tendies to buy more GME.

I quit my job selling mortgages. I didn't quit RKT (Quicken) to trade, I quit RKT because I was moving up quick and didn't want to get stuck being a phone salesman my whole life. I did work there and will provide some NON-inside information that should give you further confidence on this spectacular stock.

First, I am not the guy who posted that great DD about working for Rocket, but he made me want to post this. I cant find his fucking post or I would post link. I did used to work for them. I used to sell mortgages like a madman and made 300k in 2020 at 3 different job transitions then yolo'd my life into the stock market..lossed 10k on GME I still hold then I made 200k in the past 2 weeks on GME and RKT. This was possible because there is actually good fucking DD on here when it's not infested with shrills. I literally quit my job because I believed in WSB -- pretty retarded, but it worked out so far and I am having a blast. Please don't do it, this is not investment advice I just retail traded for a year and a half and know enough to educate myself further. Also, have a very high tolerance for losing money - you should not. 

I bought RKT at $20 a share on IPO, saw it run to 34, then lost all my gains plus some over the next 2 weeks by shorts. I had no clue that is what happened because at that time I still thought Webull News articles were a good source of information. THANK YOU GME for educating me. 

**Why you should buy RKT calls/shares?**

1) It's a safe stock still relatively

To be entirely honest, I would trust my life with Quicken Loans (RKT) even though I don't work there anymore. Their executives truly do the right thing. If you think they are going to let this stock go back to $20, then you're out of your stupid ass mind and you shouldn't be here. 

2) They knew today was going to happen

It's a bigger company than the Ticker RKT. They have very talented smart individuals in the finance world and been doing it for 30 years. O yeah, and a fuck ton of money/resources. To quote Jay baby - ""This isn't a stock you want to be short."" They literally predict rates with their technology...and they have better tech than most hf. They have a whole capital markets department, and they also own Benzinga, a market news company. To simply put it...it's not a company who doesn't know how to handle short sellers. HFs didn't listen Jay and Dan G made them his bitch today. I know Dan's personality - he would literally have called me directly and fired me on the spot if he found out I didn't return a customer call within 24 hours...that's his biggest priority. I'm not being hyperbolic, he would have literally called me personally. That's an owner you want when you invest, an owner who can handle hedge fund pussies. You don't want to be on his bad side because he loves his company and his employees like his children.  

You don't get companies like this everyday. With this type of power, resources, and intelligence, I don't see how they wouldn't be in the s&amp;p 500 in 3 - 5 years. 

3) They wont fail unless Dan ceases to exist 

It's the Quicken way (RKT). They take care of their employees, I cant stress this enough. They work you to death, but that W2 and that free $800 watch gift just because it's Monday is all worth it. Especially since you dont even need a college degree to work there, but they treat you as if you make a million a year. They are the literal tits. They train you they way they want you to work...doesn't matter where you come from. Also, your directors (managers), and highly trained and end up being a friend not a boss. They don't believe in superiority. **This is good for the stock** because everyone who works at RKT thinks it's normal to work 60 hours a week. Like I said, I worked for 4 different mortgage companies and got away with 200k ytd gross profits while swinging my dick in my hand. NOOOO MORTGAGE COMPANY WILL EVER BE ON THEIR LEVEL. ZEROOOOO. What they are eating for breakfast is more of a priority than the possibility of mortgage company competition. Wait until LDI just shits bricks when rates go up...i think that's their biggest competition...LDI has a market cap of 7 billion compared to RKT 80 billion. LDI is a mortgage company, Rocket is...well a fucking rocket and own the Cavs because why not. 

4) The move at lightning speed and eventually the world will know it as the norm for them.

If they want to innovate, they innovate. If they want to acquire new companies with the additional 40 billion in market cap they just received today, they will acquire new companies. They are obsessed with finding a better way. I don't think I ever witnessed them set a goal and not achieve that goal. It's Amazon innovation speed. 

Position 20x50c 03/19, 10x20c 01/2022 and 1k shares. 

Not financial advice, I just love the fucking stock. I literally know nothing other than the fact that you probably want to own at least a bit of RKT.",I quit my job because I like the stock and it was the BEST decision of my life,1.0,1614733629,Thorbeans

To the „Experts“ : Could you agree on the Input here?
What risks you see here, that the Hedgefonds could use to scam us again?


——-


Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC) — make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
Why is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. Over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed — the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
A Glossary of Illogical Terms — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to.
Broker Dealer or Prime Broker — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
Hedge Funds — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
Market Maker — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
Short Seller — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
The Securities and Exchange Commission — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
Depository Trust Clearing Corp — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
Short Sale — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
This relatively simple process is perfectly legal – so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
Disclosed Short — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing.
Naked Short — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
Fails–to–Deliver — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
Options — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). This report is only going to deal with calls; they are an integral part of short manipulations. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
Naked call — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list.

How The System Transacts Stocks — This explanation has been greatly simplified in the interest of brevity.

Customers — These can be individuals, institutions, hedge funds and prime broker's house accounts.
Prime Brokers — They both transact and clear stocks for their customers. Examples of prime brokers include Goldman Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Citigroup; Morgan Stanley; Bear Stearns, etc.
The DTCC — This is the holding company that owns four companies that clear and keep track of all stock transactions. This is where brokerage accounts are actually lodged. The DTC division clears over a billion shares daily. The DTCC is owned by the prime brokers, and, as a closely held private enterprise, it is impenetrable. It actively and aggressively fights all efforts to obtain information regarding naked shorting, with or without a subpoena.

Stocks clear as follows:
If customer A–1 purchases ten shares of XYZ Corp and Customer A–2 sells ten shares, then the shares are transferred electronically, all within prime broker A. Record of the transaction is sent to the DTC. Likewise, if Investor A–1 shorts ten shares of XYZ Corp and Investor A–2 has ten shares in a margin account, prime broker A borrows the shares from account A–2 and for a fee lends them to A–1.
If Customer A–1 sells shares to Customer B–2, in order to get the shares to B–2 and the money to A–1, the transaction gets completed in the DTC. The same occurs for shares that are borrowed on a short sale between prime brokers.
As a practical matter, what happens is prime broker A, at the end of the day, totals all of his shares of XYZ owned and all of the XYZ shares bought and sold, and clears the difference through the DTC. In theory, at the end of each day when all of the prime brokers have put their net positions in XYZ stock through the system, they should all cancel out and the number of shares in the DTC should equal the number of shares that XYZ has sold into the market. This almost never happens, because of the DTC stock borrow program which is discussed later.

Who are the Participants in the Fraud? The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down.
The counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.

The identity of the shorts is somewhat elusive as the shorts obscure their true identity by hiding behind the prime brokers and/or hiding behind layers of offshore domiciled shell corporations. Frequently the money is laundered through banks in a number of tax haven countries before it finally reaches its ultimate beneficiary in New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, etc. Some of the hedge fund managers who are notorious shorters, such as David Rocker and Marc Cohodes, are very public about their shorting, although they frequently utilize offshore holding companies to avoid taxes and scrutiny.
Most of the prime brokers have multiple offshore subsidiaries or captive companies that actively participate in shorting. The prime brokers also front the shorting of some pretty notorious investors. According to court documents or sworn testimony, if one follows one of the short money trails at Solomon, Smith Barney, it leads to an account owned by the Gambino crime family in New York. A similar exercise with other prime brokers, who cannot be named at this time, leads to the Russian mafia, the Cali drug cartel, other New York crime families and the Hell's Angels.
One short hedge fund that was particularly destructive was a shell company domiciled in Bermuda. Subpoenas revealed the Bermuda company was wholly owned by another shell company that was domiciled in another tax haven country. This process was five layers deep, and at the end of the subterfuge was a very well known American insurance company that cannot be disclosed because of court–ordered sealing of testimony.
Most of the large securities firms, insurance companies and multi–national companies have layers of offshore captives that avoid taxes, engage in activities that the company would not want to be publicly associated with, like stock manipulation; avoid U.S. regulatory and legal scrutiny; and become the closet for deals gone sour, like Enron.",READ READ READ - Before they take the Website offline — This is how the wallstreet system works,1.0,1614733852,Juwax

Magna is a well established manufacturer that has contracts with many major automakers, including GM, BMW and Mercedes. Fisker inc is not trying to roll the dice and take on manufacturing on their own. This is massive for the credibility of Fisker inc. They are letting successful companies handle manufacturing so they can focus on what they do best, design. A lot of startups will try to take on everything at once and fail. I believe for a company that has yet to begin production , this is relatively low risk play. Not to say their isn’t risk, it’s just less than some of it’s peers... who are focused on becoming knockoff Tesla and are trying to do everything from scratch in China.

Once again, this isn't groundbreaking information but I thought it should be said. 

Let me know what you apes think, and if you're stuck thinking about it maybe you can ask your wife's boyfriend for some advise. Don't ✋📄.",Sell off your original investment in GME at $1000,1.0,1614733999,Arpyboi

Now that we are clear, I only know one thing. This stock [KMPH] is going to MOVE tomorrow. It is awaiting approval from the FDA and if approved they are estimating a massive 100%-500% increase depending on who you listen to. Others are predicting a price drop of 50%. Again, I am retarded, but I know that with the FDA announcing approval or denial tonight tendies will be made tomorrow.

Do with this information what you will, buy it, short it, or do nothing and downvote, whatever you feel. I’m just here to let you know this thing is MOVING tomorrow. For those fellow apes that are invested glhf tomorrow.",[KMPH] Attention Fellow Apes,1.0,1614734050,JayTrain_99
