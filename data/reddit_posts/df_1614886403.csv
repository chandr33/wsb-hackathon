Now you are a silly but smart ape. You bought more than 1 banana. Because tomorrow you will be hungry again. Lets say 10. Your banana buddies also buy multible bananas ranging 5 to 15 bananas each. 

1 million degenerate apes buying 10 bananas each. 10.000.000 bananas.

46.000.000 bananas available. And apes will be hungry again tomorow.",If you think certain apes are just a tiny drop in the bucket in a certain stock you are a bananahead,0.85,1614886445,Old_Dreams
