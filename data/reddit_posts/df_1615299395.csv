2,m17acs,"TLDR: will the increase in the coin show on their balance sheet or will it show a profit for the quarter?

So I'm sitting here eating crayons doing napkin math and was confused on what to expect in earnings report.

Marathon digital holdings formerly Marathon Patent group purchased 4812.66 of the well know cryptocoin on January 25th for an estimated 150million.

Here is where the napkin math comes in:
150million divided by 4812.66 comes to a average cost of 31,167~ish
Current price being around 54,560 per coin that would lead me to assume on paper profit of 112million since purchase.

So my question is: will this profit be reported on q1 2021 earning? Or does it fall under cash equivalents on their balance sheet since they are not selling, not that I'm aware of?",$MARA earning question,1.0,1615299423,Wonderful_Deal5208

# The Roblox IPO Is Coming March 10. Here Are 2 Things Investors Should Know

## Roblox stock is well-positioned to grow over the next few years.

**Roblox** was supposed to go public in 2020. Then the explosive trading debuts of **Airbnb** and **Doordash** forced it to rethink those plans.

If Roblox had proceeded with its original IPO plan, it could have left serious money on the table, just like Airbnb and Doordash did. And since the main point of an IPO is to raise capital -- not help institutional investors make a quick buck -- there might be a better way to do it.

And there is.

## Going public via a direct listing

After postponing the IPO, Roblox raised $520 million from investors in a private funding round. The deal gave Roblox a $29.5 billion valuation -- [up sevenfold ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/1-chart-showing-robloxs-12x-valuation-increase/)from a year ago.

Next, Roblox announced its plan to go public via a direct listing. This [route](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/01/spacs-vs-direct-listings-key-differences-investors/) could further save Roblox money on underwriters' fees while still taking the company public.

Roblox will finally make its market debut on March 10, trading under the ticker RBLX. But before rushing in to buy the stock, here are two things you should know.

## Roblox's money-making machine

CEO David Baszucki and Erik Cassel founded Roblox in 2004 with a vision of connecting people through immersive virtual worlds. On Roblox, users create games and play games created by other users. Initially, Roblox had a user base of several hundred people. Today, more than 36 million users play and interact on Roblox on a daily basis.

There are two crucial parts to Roblox's business model. The first part is the gaming platform on which users (developers and gamers) build and play games. Here, 7 million developers are building what Roblox calls ""experiences"" -- games, virtual items, and worlds. Thanks to Roblox's tools, it is easy for even children to create exciting games using Lego-like blocks instead of code. 

With 18 million experiences available to choose from, Roblox can easily attract new users and retain old ones. And as more users join Roblox's platform (and spend money on those games), developers are incentivized to create more engaging content -- drawing in even more gamers.

But that's just half the story.

When users enter Roblox, they usually invite their friends to join them. Then those friends invite *their* friends, and so on. With endless experiences to choose from, this virtuous cycle sustains Roblox's network effect. Sound familiar? That's how [**Facebook** grew](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/28/proof-facebook-inc-has-a-moat.aspx) into what it is today. 

And because these games are not ""just"" games -- they are *Minecraft-*style worlds with plenty to discover -- Roblox's users spend lots of time on the platform. Even users who aren't gamers stick around just to hang out with each other. Like Facebook, Roblox is a social network.

Backed by the sheer size of its community, Roblox has managed to carve out an ecosystem with its own rules, economy, and currency. Users don't have to pay to play most games on Roblox. But they can buy and spend Robux -- Roblox's in-game currency -- to upgrade their avatars with accessories, clothing, or special powers.

To generate revenue, Roblox gets a 30% cut on user spending. The rest goes to developers on the platform. It also earns a commission when developers convert Robux into real dollars. So far, all this has worked out well for Roblox. Revenue grew 56% in 2019 to $488 million. In the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew even faster -- rising 68% to $589 million.

## Roblox is just getting started

COVID-19 was a turbocharger for Roblox, [just like](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/06/3-top-video-game-stocks-to-buy-in-october/) it was for many other video game companies. Roblox's daily active users [jumped 97%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/why-is-everyone-talking-about-the-roblox-ipo/) year over year in 2020 -- the fastest rate of growth ever. Many of Roblox's users are still new, but will likely become more engaged over time. As they discover great games to play and immerse themselves in Roblox's many communities, they will naturally spend more Robux.

Roblox is also targeting international markets to grow its user base further. It has invested in automated translation technology and a regional compliance system that will help developers reach a bigger global audience. It is also working with **Tencent Holdings** to grow its business in China, the world's biggest video game market.

Beyond gaming, Roblox's potential dramatically widens its addressable market. It aims to evolve into what it calls a ""human co-experience"" platform where people can come together to play, learn, and work. For example, Roblox could host virtual classes, alongside graduation ceremonies, corporate meetings, and concerts in the future. Moreover, as its social network grows, Roblox will become even more attractive as a marketing tool. In fact, major brands like **Netflix** and Marvel have already introduced branded content onto the platform. 

For Roblox, all these opportunities represent potential growth engines -- and a bright future. While it is unlikely that all of these ventures will end up being a runaway success, some will, and that will be enough to keep Roblox growing fast for many years ahead.

## It will be a volatile ride ahead

2020 was the year of the red-hot tech stock. Popular names like **Square** and **MercadoLibre** are trading at steep valuations after rising 240% and 180% last year. Newer tech IPOs like **Unity Software** and Airbnb have more than doubled from their offering price.

Roblox will likely get a similarly warm welcome, along with a high IPO valuation. That's understandable, given Roblox's track record of rapid growth -- as well as the potential to sustain it for many more years.

Still, that's no reason to leave caution to the wind. Investors should not overpay for a stock, no matter how great its prospects look. Also, Roblox is running at massive losses, and this may be the case for years ahead.

It's not unusual for [high-growth companies](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/) to invest heavily to fuel market-beating growth. But a loss-making business *and* high valuations make any stock extremely vulnerable to a market correction. And given how [shaky tech](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/these-2-tech-giants-pulled-the-nasdaq-back-from-th/) stocks are these days, Roblox won't be in for a smooth ride.

PLATINUM is extremely undervalued right now. Thought you guys should know.

Okay retards, pay attention if you can read more than 5 sentences in a row.

Here are a couple key elements:

**The whole world supply of platinum** ever mined would be turned into a cube with 2.5 meters or 8.2 feet each side and **is likely to fit in your living room**. Yes, that is how rare it is. Only 8 million ounces or 226.8 tons of platinum were pulled out of Mother Earth.

Historically platinum have been more expensive than gold, because it is much rarer. But now, not only gold is more expensive, the difference in price between these two metals never been higher.

This basically means that or gold is way too expensive, or platinum is way too underpriced.

[Blue line is Gold the Orange one is Platinum. If you are colorblind the Gold is the expensive right now](https://preview.redd.it/bx41v8xuh0m61.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4794e2c62aad945103979ce404ef6d8865204bd)

  

Today the ratio is around 1.75 which means you can trade 1 kilo or ounce or gram or whatever of Gold into 1.75 kilo or ounce or gram or whatever of Platinum. This Ratio peaked in march/2020 to 2.25 and pulled back a little bit, but still higher than previous all time high. 

This Ratio used to be near 0.5 and 0.4 between 2000 and 2008, and then 0.6 for a period after that, and for me at least, the current ratio doesn’t make sense.

Also, it does have excellent physical properties, much better than gold, which makes it more useful for any industrial/electrical use than any other metal. 

The metal has excellent resistance to corrosion, is stable at high temperatures and has stable electrical properties (literally copied this from Wikipedia).

Let me explain like you are 5. Whatever you want to use gold for, platinum will be better.

**But why is this precious metal so undervalued when compared to gold?** You might be thinking.

Well, basically almost every society or country in the world for the last 5,000+ years have been using gold as store of value exchange currency.

**And again, you might be asking yourself why did they use gold and not platinum?**

It´s simple. They didn’t know it existed until the year of 1557 when Spain ~~committed genocide~~ colonized Latin America and discovered that natives had this “impurity” in their gold (So they decided to take all the gold to Spain, to clean it, of course). Europeans only recognized it as a metal in 1752.

Okay, we know this metal exist since 1752, we know it is rare. **Why we never replaced gold for platinum as a store of value since then?** Your uncultured Ape ass is asking yourself by now.

Here comes the tricky part. First, we didn’t have enough of it to become a global thing. But most important, **WE DIDN’T HAVE TECHNOLOGY TO WORK WITH IT**. That’s it. We knew it was there. We knew the value of it all this time, but we couldn’t melt it until the invention of blowtorch in 1799, but this only became popular in the late of 19th Century.

What I am saying is only at the dawn of 1900’s platinum became a viable and useful metal. The mankind will replace gold for platinum as store of value at some point. Maybe next week, maybe 400 years from now, I don’t know.

**Am I buying some Platinum right now?** Yes. Maybe shorting Gold to buy Platinum and profit from the decreasing spread between them. If Gold is not going to fall, Platinum should be doubling it’s price. This is the way.

**Should you buy it?** Maybe yes. Probably not. I literally have no idea what I am talking about. I am just some random dude on the internet. I might be a billionaire trying to use you guys to manipulate the market or a bald fat guy in the mid 40’s living in my parents’ basement with a Star Wars t-shirt that clearly is not my size anymore.

Anyway, just in case you want to buy some platinum ETF you should look for 

· **Aberdeen Standard Platinum Shares ETF (PPLT)**

Expense Ratio: 0.60%

Assets Under Management: $1.1 billion

· **GraniteShares Platinum Trust (PLTM)**

Expense Ratio: 0.50%

Assets Under Management: $15.3 million

· **iPath Series B Bloomberg Platinum Subindex Total Return ETN (PGM)**

Expense Ratio: 0.45%

Assets Under Management: $4.4 million

This is not a crusade against hedge funds. Not a typical WSB short squeeze. Just some boring long term value investing. Find a irrationality on the market trade it and wait until it gets where it should be, but remember that markets can remain irrational for a insanely long period of time.

Yes, this is a financial advice. A stupid one, if you are stupid enough to get advises from a random guy in a forum full of retards.

**TL;DR:** Many checking/savings accounts only insure up to $250,000. Many investment accounts only insure up to $500,000. If you expect to have &gt;$250,000 in cash/assets soon, make sure you strategically place that money into appropriately insured and/or numerous accounts so that *all* of your money/assets are insured, not just a portion of it.

# Why can't I just use the accounts I already have?

From what I've seen, most consumer-oriented financial accounts only insure your money for up to $250,000 through the FDIC. There are some exceptions of course, Joint Accounts come to mind, which seem to usually offer double that value ($500,000) since the account is shared between two people. 

If you just made out big on your GME stocks, or any other stocks for that matter, you may have hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars that you will now need to put somewhere safe. IDK about you, but I don't want to put $1,000,000 in an account that is only insured up to $250,000.

Of course, if you do obtain this level of financial abundance, you should be re-investing it in one way or another, not just letting all of it sit in a checking or savings account. Keep a good portion in savings just so you have a large cushion of course, but make sure you consider reintroducing some of that money into an investment strategy.

# 

# How do I protect more than $250,000 then?

**Find an institution that insures your money for more than $250,000.**

I won't mention any particular institutions just yet, as I'm still pretty uncertain as to what this subreddit allows (Reddit rules are always so fragile), but I can tell you what is out there. This information will be touted by an organization if they offer it, and the organizations I personally will be using are quite well known. If the mods tell me I can post the names of these institutions here, I'll update this post, I just didn't want to jump the gun.

I know of several financial accounts/organizations (modern ones even) that insure your account up to $1,000,000. How? They spread your money across 4 different banking institutions behind the scenes, with each bank insuring your money for $250,000. $250k x 4 banks = $1 million of FDIC insurance. They do this behind the scenes so that it doesn't affect you in basically any other way (from what I gather).

On top of this, if the same organization happens to offer investment accounts as well, those are typically insured through the SPIC up to $500,000 ($250,000 of which can be cash). So in total, you could put up to $1,000,000 in our checking/savings account, and another $500,000 into your investment portfolio through that same organization, and you would be insured for a grand total of $1,500,000

&amp;#x200B;

**Diversify your finances across multiple institutions**

If you expect to have more than $1,500,000 in your possession, consider spreading the money/assets across several institutions, as each one should insure your money separately. If you already put $1,500,000 in an account like the one I mentioned above, find another institution that offers an account just like it and throw up to another $1,500,000 in that one too.

You could then place another $250,000 in each of your standard/consumer-oriented checking/savings account(s) to insure even more money.

Rinse &amp; Repeat this process until your money is insured to your comfort level. This will ensure that, if one or more of your banks/institutions goes under, you won't risk losing your hard earned tendies.

&amp;#x200B;

69,m17ilo,"Alright we've gone past 200 now, currently at 220 at premarket. It makes sense why some people will be thinking to take profits. But if you are please be smart about it and maximise your returns while ensuring you hold on to maximise any potential squeeze.

There are many new people on this sub who are new to the market and need to hear this basic advice on how to play now they are seeing some green.

You need to set stop losses that rise with the increasing price to guarantee profit:

- Let's say your cost basis is 150
- You decide the current price is a nice profit for you (I don't believe it is the squeeze is still on, but for arguments sake let's run with it)
- You then decide to sell at 200, take your profits and run home.
- Be fucking smart about it.
- Instead
- You should let the price run and set your stops accordingly. 
- For example, the price is at 220 right now. You set a stop at 190 in case it tanks.
- But if it rises to 250 then set a stop at 220 in case it drops.
- If it rises to 300 set a stop at 250 etc etc
- This way you maximise your returns in case this keeps running higher and higher.

A fair word of caution though, you may be stopped out by algos. Or if this drops suddenly then rises again you will be stopped out.

Also you will kick yourself if you sell here if it rises to 1k and beyond.

But if it helps some of you paper hands hold then set larger stops. So 100 dollar increments or larger till we hit 1k.

Myself personally I am way in the green right now. I will set a stop at my cost basis and take the risk. That way if we see a sudden tank then I will get back my investment, but I won't be stopped out by 20 dollar drops. And will maximise the run

Also something not as common is what we do if our short term capital gains are over $100K, $1mil, multimill, etc. Also how do we tax write off our Nintendo Switch donations to children's hospitals? Should we create an LLC if we make a certain amount of money to protect ourselves? I'll edit with more questions when I think of them and will add any additions from the comments.

Remember that this is going to be life changing money and the best way to not squander it is to financially plan for your future with the help of a professional.

I am not a financial advisor, I literally cannot put pants on in the morning without help, do your own research

I am going to be discussing a specific person by name, please do not witchhunt and harass them, they are an innocent boomer that runs boomer businesses and have done nothing to warrant harrassment.

Fellow apes, I have a bit of information to share with you about about everyones favorite stock, and a headline to look out for in the next few weeks regarding the current CEO.

The current CEO of GameStop is a man named George Sherman, *an old school executive that specializes in Brick and Mortar/retail locations*

I pointed this out in [another thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx2n82/draining_the_swamp_gme_notable_hires/gpl0k8k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3), but I feel like everyone needs to realize that THE CURRENT CEO IS GOING TO ABSOLUTELY BE REPLACED (most definitely with Cohen).  If you had any doubts in your mind this was happening, here's some info you might like to know:

Before becoming the CEO of GameStop, Sherman was an executive at [several retail stores such as Target, Victra, and Best Buy](https://venturebeat-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/gamestop-new-ceo/amp/?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16152987008819&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2019%2F03%2F21%2Fgamestop-new-ceo%2F).  Sherman is someone that has served his entire executive career running physical stores.  *The polar opposite of GMEs future as an E-Commerce giant*.

On top of this, George Sherman served as Victras CEO (a brick and mortar Verizon phone retailer) for a rather short time frame of around ~5 years.  I don't know the guy personally, and I'm not part of Victras upper management, but I can make an educated guess that someone constantly shuffling around executive positions and not lasting very long at all of them is a sign of someone that's not easy to work with, and a sign of someone that probably isn't best suited as an executive for a company in the midst of a huge e-commerce pivot.

As we saw before when Cohen was essentially elected as the shadow CEO, GMEs share value absolutely exploded over this good news, just imagine when it becomes official 

Ryan Cohen is draining the fucking swamp one by one, we already saw the huge momentum caused by ousting the old CFO, hes unofficially taking the reigns as CEO currently and I can only imagine it will be equally huge news when it's 100% official 

THE CURRENT GAMESTOP CEO IS A BOOMER THAT RUNS BOOMER STORES, ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE GOES, THIS HEADLINE IS GOING TO BE INSANE 🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr CEO go bye-bye, GME go 🚀🚀🚀

91,m17l39,"Friends, apes, friendly apes, and everyone else, I have one simple question for you ....

How often do the opportunities present themself to become a millionaire? It’s a rare thing indeed, and it is ever more rare for someone to seize the opportunity and take the steps required to make it a reality. I bought in to GME because I did my DD and I believe that this is MY chance.

Money has never been important to me. I’m a simple guy who never cared, nor needed, the finer things in life. However, I also have a family, and what it could provide for them makes it extremely important to me. I have an IRA from a previous job that has never been discussed, and if I lose it all it wouldn’t affect us. I say that because, more than seeing my investment hit 7 figures, I’m most excited to tell my wife the good news when it happens. Notice I said “When”, because I do believe it.

I like the stock, I believe in my DD that it will soar. I believe that it has the potential to be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. Today, while some wealthy do charitable things with their fortunes, a large percentage of them just want to become richer with no regard for others. Seeing all the nice deeds being shared by those who profited off of the late January surge also gives me the belief that we can do a better job with our wealth when it comes to helping others. If the financial aspect doesn’t motivate you, then the latter should.

So, apes, I am going to continue to hold, because I believe in the stock, I believe in our resolve, and I believe that they are massively short. To those who took the time to read, thank you.

To those who didn’t ... TLDR - Hold 🚀🚀🚀

Turns out the company is experiencing internal management problems (as soon as I find the link to the thread I'll post it, on mobile so I can't save a draft..)

UI has been pushing UDM (unifi dream machine).  Basically an all in one network that handles network, video NVR, IP Phone system, and security (physical, like access cards and automatic gate locks). 

The company grew this line too fast, launched it and its buggy af. 

The biggest gripe from the user base is their utter lack of support.  This recent one caught my eye:

This guy didn't get a response for almost a month.  During that time his customers sites missed B&amp;E attempts.  And a possible rape.
