So here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!

## Why Hedge?
It's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.


Aknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.

This guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.

For convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.

## Imagine this scenario!
Your favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. 

If one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -&gt; 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.


And now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.

Some quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.


Hedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.

The runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k

The dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.


The hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.

But that ""rebalancing"" is key here and makes all the difference.


## Rebalancing
If your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.

Initially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.

Stocks after the runup: 80%*$116k/$120 -&gt; ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)


But the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll ""have to"" buy shares for $3.2k. 

Total stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k / $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)


Since you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.


Briefly:

### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.
### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in



## What can be used to hedge?
There are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.

You should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.

### Options

Options are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. 

Books have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading ""The Greeks and Hedging Explained"" by P. Leoni for that.


Very, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).

### Currency
This is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.

### Precious Metals
Precious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.

I don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.

There are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.
### SPACs (No, really!)
SPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.

That's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.


So why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.


What to look out for / type into google: Near NAV SPACs.

### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)
You _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.

So if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.

If you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.

I really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure / telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.


## TL;DR
Want to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.


## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!
### Hedgefunds bad
Yes.
### Hedgefunds hedge?
They used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.
The goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.


This has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.

Art, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. 


They do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.
### The shorting meta
You've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.


Imagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.

Since both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.

That's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _""They're the good guys""_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.

AMC is not GME. AMC‚Äôs management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from &gt;50% to &lt;10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren‚Äôt buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn‚Äôt actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.

If you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution. Please let me know what I‚Äôm missing.
