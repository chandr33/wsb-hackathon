12,m278es,"So i have a theory, when GME hits ¬£350 it appears to me that something weird happens like robin hood cancels or there is this flash crash today.

My theory on this is there is an algorithmic thing going on with clearing and retail purchases. As we know it can take up to two days for trades to fully execute. During which time the broker and clearing house are on the hook if there is a mismatch/bad match or other cock up. This risk is massive if there is large amounts of volume in one direction as the clearing house or broker could be the bag holder and then the share price drops. As such brokers and clearing houses probably have limits on their exposure to such issues.

My theory is volitity and rusks hits a predetermined levels in the computer, and then the clearing house stops accepting orders from brokers.  They probably have bench mark for what they determine is the floor of the share value and a probability that of it dropinh while executing in the next 2 days.

So when the ‚Äúover valued‚Äù order hits a difference of x eg ¬£350 and say the bench mark ¬£40 and the historic volatility hits y% change per day say 40% swing. The computer stops accepting thinking there is an error which causes robin hood to put up more capital thus they respond with the buy order ban or the clearing house goes NO causing the flash crash as it effectively does the same thing.",Gme @$350 question/theory.

Yes, I lost big by paper-handing my put contracts when I thought the equity was going to the stratosphere. Well, it collapsed today and I sold the contracts at its peak. No, this was not in GME or AMC. I would never bet against you guys. Your energy is too strong for a measly man like me. 

My mistake was not believing in my conviction, and it cost me a lot. It‚Äôs not going to force me on the streets or anything but it made me flinch...initially. I went through four out of the five stages of grief in the morning, and I‚Äôm now facing acceptance. The money is gone, but I fucking doubled down on my other conviction picks. With the lessons I learned, I‚Äôm not backing down, and Wall Street can suck my balls. 

The only thing I learned is that I‚Äôm right when I think I‚Äôm wrong, and I‚Äôm wrong when I think I‚Äôm right. The secret is that you can‚Äôt think, you just have to follow that lambo passion pick.

27,m279jt,"Psychology to keep up

Hello everybody and welcome. This is going to be my first extended post here. I‚Äôll try to keep it simple as I want to show tell you just a couple of things.
This is not DD, Il leave it for the big brains in here, which we have a lot! I personally thank to everybody requiring they time to set up DD so we retardads know what‚Äôs happening and how to interprete everything going on.
If you seen any writing mistake, I‚Äôm sorry.
I‚Äôm from Europe, and I study economics. The great thing about economics is that you learn to know that world is much more about behaviour than actual numbers, I‚Äôve also did and internship on a stock broker so I learn to know what‚Äôs behind the price, and how order flows is then sold to MM etc etc bla bla, on this way, I‚Äôve meet some pretty nice people from the high world of finance and I‚Äôve learn some pretty good lessons you can all apply this times and in your brilliant future as crayons eaters and big money makers.

Rule 1: THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH

So, please don‚Äôt get discouraged when we see dips like this today, you don‚Äôt expect them to just give up done you? Get ready for war, they will bring a lot of tricks, social blackout, SS ladders, no updated, wrong info etc etc like we‚Äôve saw in the past. Today on my phone it was marking 17:34 (European hours) and on yahoo finance the last updated was 17:29, and this is supposed to be updated every second. I might be completely wrong but it looks like that not everybody is going to their brokers/bank app to check the price all the time, personally i don‚Äôt, I rely on yahoo etc. If your a paper hand, you get excited (watch my next point) to see price almost on $350, app stop updating and then you see it almost on $200, what you think weak people will do? Sell!! They know how to play with your mind, and speed up your heart rate to you take bad decisions. I.E. paper hand and sell.

Rule 2: A ANGRY MIND IS A LIMITED MIND

Stay cool guys, remember what you felt when price was as $40 after you bought at peak and this guys cheated and switched of the plug? I bet a lot of your were feeling like shtt, terrible and the worst, you were feeling dumb. Some of you started to think you could have spend the money in another thousand ways, feeling embarrassed and some of theme even accepted that loss and sold. So what about now, when stock was at $350? You were excited, feeling crazy, feeling you did the best choice of your life in holding (which in fact you did ahah). My point here is that, this humor switches are now healthy for you, stay cool, don‚Äôt be that guy that went to the casino, lost on roulette and gets angry, no, it is supposed to be fun. So choose you side, either betting or not, stay cool, when loosing and when winning, your making 100/200/300% in a day, great, keep going, your losing, great, you knew the risks hold and keep going. You have to control your emotions, either positive and negative, of course this is easier said than done but think about this next time you‚Äôre close to the extreme of one of these two types of emotions, stay neutral, and never take decisions based on emotion!

Rule 3: KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR YOU

Today i was having classes (online), so in Europe we wake up before pre market starts in USA, and once it opened, few min later it was up already 10/15% and I start wondering, why check the every 5 min? It will have ups and downs and it will only increase the likelihood of taking a irrational decisions and messing with your mind. So for me. I never check the price more than once every one/two hours. Will the price go from $300 to $500.000 in 60/120 minutes? We would need at least 70 halts of 10 min, that‚Äôs a lot of hours... by doing this you reduce the stress you put on yourself, screen fatigue is a really matter, we used to speak about it on the broker i was all the time. That was a trader there that was only trading on daily charts, this guys was trading heavy amounts of money I can tell you. You know what this guys was doing after placing the trades? Get home, get his dog and take a walk, what a fkng king. He told me this kept him way of screen fatigue, kept him chill, not looking to ups and downs and on the end of the day there is only two options, either you win or you lose. (Well, with GME you can only win) So why bother in the middle? You made your game plane, your DD, you know your target, just leave and stop feeding you body with anxiety, you‚Äôll pay the price in 10/20 years!

Rule 4: NUMBERS NEVER LIE

Have you every study the beauty contest theory? I recommend you to take a look on YouTube or something, there is always something behind the numbers, nothing is happing just because. And mass behaviour shapes everything. This volume on selling was incredible high, no any paper hands would do it, this was heavy short and stop/trailing stop getting activated, I used to see that a lot on the broker. You know were these numbers are so you just need to move in that direction! So, don‚Äôt do it guys, be smart, you are not playing against a kid in the backyard, there guys know how to mess the thing ups, don‚Äôt make their life easier. Start to think, if I were on their shoes, what would I do? And then ask again, ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm about to do makes sense‚Äù setting stop loss in this one makes 0 sense wtf, your just letting them know where you want do get out. This is not Apple, boys, this is GME, wild ride, ride or die.

So, to sum up, don‚Äôt expect this to go straight to 500k, it will have a lot of fights in between, if you don‚Äôt have stomach for this, then your about the be a slave in the world! Nothing comes free and the higher this going with higher will be the volatile and the swings, I can tell you they prefer to go bankrupt than to say they lost, can you imagine what would happen if they admited that they lost? There would be no more game from them. (That‚Äôs what is going to be anyways). So, expect them to try everything, everytrick, things i don‚Äôt even saw and don‚Äôt know how, this is just playing, the real war doesn‚Äôt even begun, trust me,but guess what????

I have my plan, HOLDING TFU

SO CHILL MY GUYS, don‚Äôt over complicate, get ready to see heads rolling in the street, and enjoy the ride, you‚Äôll remember this for the rest of your life!!

GOOD LUCK

BUT, a great gift. In January they lost a lot of money, they covered by attacks and the extension of contracts (with a lot of borrowed money, they lost more than 50% of their own capital), and now, they started to liquidate long positions from other companies in which they have shares. to open new short positions at GME and attack the price. This means that they no longer have money, they no longer receive loans and they resorted to the last option. So their end is near. Patience, without nerves and panic.

81,m27ev2,"I found out last week that my bank investment app (RBC) basically margin called me and sold all my GME shares @$45 (literally at its lowest dip). I have been holding @$250 and never bothered to check my account for the past month since I was conviction holding. Little did I know, with a basic investing account (you need to open a separate margin account to do options and margin trading), the bank allows you to buy limit orders without cash in the account itself - they expect you to know this and inject money back in to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the borrowed funds. I ended up ‚Äúover-buying‚Äùaround 50 shares @$300 back in Jan at its peak, and had no idea I could do that. The bank ended up sending me a notice of my account going into negative balance and that they would liquidate my investments to take back what was owed, and they did that a week after. 

The worst part? That email was sent straight into my spam folder - I wouldn‚Äôt have ever known. 

I lost all my money and basically 90% of my portfolio, so I know ill be jerking off to loss porn for a couple years. Its depressing to see that GME ended up mooning when I know I couldve been there to witness the majestic comeback. Just looking at wallstreetbets hurts my head and gives me anxiety. 

Its been an honour riding with you boys. Ill be leaving this subreddit for a while to recuperate emotionally. And yes, ill be sucking dick behind Wendies to slowly make back 3 years of my salary. 

Godspeed my brethren, i wont be boarding the rocket, ill stay behind to watch the rocket blast into andromeda.

88,m27fki,"Can someone with a slightly wrinkled brain explain these candle wick spikes? 

As far as I understand it is either an issue with Fidelity Trader Pro's ability to keep up with trading... orrr it's sell limits that have been set around $340 that are being hit by market buys? Which, again.. am retarded, but if the latter is accurate then would that mean there is a massive amount of volume on low liquidity? 

Is that at all reasonable to assume? Is anyone else seeing these ridiculous candle wick spikes? I saw them in reverese back when GME tanked early Feb.",No news on GME increase but big news on GME 40% fall,1.0,1615407678,immafivestarman
