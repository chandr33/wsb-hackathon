85,lxlj79,"Alright y’all, yesterday a lot of you apes bought in as the price zoomed up premarket and are now bagholding and freaking out. Don’t fret my fellow degenerates. If you woke up and looked at the price premarket today you probably got spooked, but it has been a brutal 24 hours for the market. Good thing $UWMC is a long term hold! Yes there will be volatility this week and next as traders look for day trade and swing trade moves. But, I cannot wait for 3/19. 

I’d argue yesterday was a pretty damn good day for $UWMC regardless of entry price. I personally would have used those dips to average down and accumulate some shares, but what do I know I’m just a smooth brained bag holder. Anyway, UWMC still ended up green 5%. (Shoutout GME for finishing green as well!) Do I need to remind you guys what happened to $RKT yesterday? A lot of those investors jumped ship and hopped on $UWMC! But at the same time, $RKTs demise certainly scared some potential $UWMC investors away, kinda oxymoronic. UWMC has its own momentum, and will get to orbit regardless of what $RKT does due to all of the catalysts and intangibles I mentioned in my first [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwfasi/why_uwmc_is_most_definitely_the_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

(TLDR: Dividend date 3/10 and Russell 1000 &amp; 3000 index addition 3/22). 

The shorts were ALL over UWMC yesterday. It went from 1,000,000 available shares shorted on 3/2, to under 90,000 shares available to short by market close yesterday. (Editing for transparency: looks like some shorts have closed their positions and it’s up to 250,000 short shares available as of 9:15 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc ) Of course the institutions are gonna jump all over this once they see WSB talking about it because they know there are a lot of paper hands who will get scared and sell, but diamond hands are needed to beat these losers 💎 🙌.

While a short squeeze is certainly possible, I think the true potential comes in the form of a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Look at all these calls for 3/19 https://imgur.com/a/99Cx5LI 

If $UWMC can stay above $10, this has the potential to go to Mars, and fly right past the moon! 

I would like to add that while all this options activity is fantastic, it will be all for nothing if the contracts aren’t backed up with shares. I’ll personally be loading up on shares while this thing is still reasonably priced.

Take care of yourselves
