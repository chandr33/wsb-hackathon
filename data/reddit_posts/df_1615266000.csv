We have been working on the music for the project since 2019. When the pandemic hit we thought it was probably best not to release the music right away and to wait for a more opportune time. 

With how crazy things have been over the past couple of months we decided to gear up for a release so I’m pledging that when the stock hits $100k we’ll release the music on the journey up to $500k. 

Much love to all of you beautiful apes!

**TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM**

Also, this was deleted by the moderators for some reason please don't take it down!

But, the only way we can do this together.

**Remember why we're here, remember what we went through, remember the goal.**

**As long as we continue to hold GameStop,** and buy through whatever (Whether it be short ladder attacks, market manipulation, or bots flooding this page telling us it’s over) **we can make history**.🚀

**We are looking at potentially the largest wealth redistribution in history!** Something our kids, grandkids, wife’s boyfriend, will look back upon with a smile! Knowing that we did it.

**We need to hold,** a few weeks ago people said $100 wouldn’t happen a week ago with RKT they said GameStop was dead, and $200 would never be reached, but we held.🦧🦧🦧🦧🦧

**Now I’ve been skeptical, about game stops potential to reach $800, or even $1000, but with the past five days, my skepticism has turned into optimism.** Thanks to you, my fellow apes, I can now say confidently that not only can we do this but we can exceed it!

Remember to hold! **We determine the price! If you sell off at $400 it will end, this is our opportunity, our Trojan horse, our 300 Sparta, if we hold we can determine the price to $800, $900, $1000, $2000.** 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

**The next few days will be rough, but glorious.** We will succeed and we will rewrite history in the process. Thank you apes for joining together we will rewrite history🚀🦧🍌

**TL:DR- We determine the price, through weeks we held and held through thick and thin. And now it is time for us to make history. Remember we determine the price! If you sell it for $200 then it is all for nothing. Our realistic price should be $800, so let’s get there, and let’s get farther! Alone Ape week, together Ape strong!** 🦧🦧🦧🦧🦧

**Now let’s get those tendies!!!!** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌

36,m0zh8b,"So, this is my first post here. I've been reading threads for a long time, and have resisted starting a reddit account for more than a decade. That all being said...

I caught wind of the new cry\*\*o hype a few months back, and monitored the threads. I was skeptical as I should be, or as anyone should be if they are throwing money at something. I made my first cry\*\*o cash investment. I had mined in the past, and since, very much so, lost every single bit of information I need to recover any of that .05XXXXX \*\*\*coin. By far, because, well, that was worth $.50 at the time..Ish.. I saw it spike over 10k for the first time, and was blown away. I could not believe it was real. 

This time I saw it spike over 50k. Well over 50k at one point.

This was a turning point for me. I finally bought some currency. I'm not sure of the rules of the forum, because I have not read them, so I won't mention specifics.. However this coin was an assortment of alts. I invested 175 bucks. At varying points in time, in different currencies I was watching trends in.  I have not lost a single penny..

&amp;#x200B;

Within 2 days of my initial investment I saw it rise to $220 but peak at $279!  The lowest it's been since then ( After Elon decided to open his fucking mouth) everything dumped, but at that point I was over $300. The lowest it hit since was $212, and I've just sat on it. I'm now at  $328.05

If you are new, START SMALL. Feel out the market, and pay attention to patterns. I really don't know shit about this, but I can tell you one thing... I've damn near doubled my investment. I'm buying more or cashing out at the first chance.

61,m0zo3m,"What are the Fed’s dual mandates?

* Full employment

* Inflation control

What is inflation control?

* The reason markets always go up with time is the ever-perpetual growth nature of productivity; that’s how the pie doesn’t get diced up, but grows forever. But even across many decades the growth of productivity experiences ebbs and flows—which we’ll get into later.

* As technology and innovation caused increased productivity over the last 100 years, the Fed has developed many tools to control inflation if it runs too hot or cold. This began with using interest rates as a lever, with buying risky debt that bubbles up (QE) as a second lever. Modern Monetary Theory introduces a third lever: direct money to consumers to stimulate inflation, also known as helicopter drops. With the pandemic, we’ve seen a version of this already.

* The elephant in the room is that we’re around the end/beginning of a long-term credit cycle (read PRINCIPLES by Ray Dalio if you’re unfamiliar with the term). As a rough example, a long cycle can last 50-75 years and a short cycle 6-8 years. But what really matters is that monetary stimulus becomes less and less effective as more and more stimulus is used to pay debts that have grown throughout the multiple short credit cycles that make up a long credit cycle. The Fed bazooka was a bazooka for exactly this reason.

* Most importantly, price control involves both directions. Despite concerns of hyperinflation that we saw the last century, this is not the case today but exactly the opposite and is a feature of the end/beginning of a long credit cycle. Productivity and wages have slowed for over a decade, and the things we do spend money on—and don’t—have grown cheaper or are now free digital services (except for health care and housing and others, which have more than filled that spending gap).

What is full employment, and why is it a part of the Fed mandate?

* Full employment is the point where there is some amount of labor shortage, causing companies to start competing for workers by offering higher wages. This creates inflation. Before the pandemic, the Fed considered the economy close to full employment and lower wage workers were starting to see a small amount of wage growth. 

What do the Fed’s dual mandates mean for markets?

* Because of the nature of where we are in the long term credit cycle, it means everything. And with the pandemic, the major monetary intervention that was due to come eventually happened earlier, and some would argue greater than without: lower rates for longer, QE indefinitely, and perhaps eventually a firmer version of MMT once the first two levers stop working enough to make much a difference in accomplishing their mandates. 

Why won’t the potential negative effects of the Fed’s dual mandates matter any time soon? 

* If it took a decade after the Great Recession for the economy to reach full employment and to finally see the hints of wage growth, the road to full employment could take more than a couple years—recent history has shown it could take another short term cycle. 

* The tug and pull pendulum between capital and labor has been swinging towards capital for decades, where most of the productivity gains are being realized by capital. This is politics, which is not a part of the Fed’s framework so we won’t go there, but it does put them in a hard place. This is good for markets considering the Fed’s dual mandates. Eventually the pendulum will swing the other way, but history has shown it likely won’t happen this cycle—and even if it does the politics will be slow and behind a backdrop of extremely accommodative monetary policy that will likely last the entirety of the current short credit cycle in some degree.

**TLDR: The biggest threat to markets is the Fed adjusting to full employment and the inflationary forces of rising wages—not a temporary inflationary bounce of the economy opening back up and the pent-up spending demand it will bring. History shows it will take at least a short credit cycle for that inflationary threat to be fully realized.**",The Fed’s dual mandates and what that means for markets (and how the potentially negative effects won’t matter any time soon),1.0,1615267556,chadimmaculate

This will probably auto delete but whatever I wanna try and say it anyway.

I think what the news, HF, whoever, doesn't understand is... This changes nothing for us.

Hear me out. I think GME can hit a max of about 10k, otherwise the world gets sucked into a blackhole, and we all die. At 10k, for me thats $160k. That amount of money pays me and my partners student loans after taxes. That's it. Student loans have been pause for a year, and we've been living comfortably because of it. We also live comfortably when we had to pay them. So for us the only change is, I might be able to put more money towards retirement, and maybe retire when I'm 80, instead of 85.

I think most people are in my situation. Right now my position is about three grand. If I lose it all who cares. If it goes to 1k. Who cares. If it goes to 10k, maybe I have a reason to pop out. So why not 💎🙌 till 🚀🌚.

This will probably leave me holding a bag, but again who cares. Maybe if I had 1,600 shares or 16,000 shares i would be more diligent. But I don't, because I am effectively poor.

And that's what they are fighting, and that's what they don't understand. They are fighting a people they created, a people with no fucks to give.

88,m0zyo3,"@InTheMoneyAdam. I recently purchased a few call options on $VALE over the news of Tesla partnering with the Brazilian mining company VALE. Over the weekend, I saw that there were many call options favoring a rise in their stock. By midday, I was shocked to see that so many out options were placed against the company. I am new to options trading and I found that your videos have been very helpful in getting and staying, ‘In the money’. I cannot wait to educate myself more through viewing your videos. Please, keep up the great work!",$VALE Is what happened today what is meant by the term shorting a stock?,1.0,1615268709,DOGEAddyNNP
