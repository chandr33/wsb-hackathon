We all know what happened after that and it started again, my paper hands were shaking and I was considering selling with a loss of 85%.  it went on for a few days and I thought about it.  but suddenly I relaxed and thought fuck it, I'm part of something that is much bigger than me.  fuck the money.

Eli Lily shocked everyone in January with a preliminary report that their new drug **slowed the effects of Alzheimer's BY 32%**. The stock jumped almost 12% on the news, but most analysts have been waiting on actual details to verify their results. 

**Those details are coming THIS SATURDAY, March 13th** at the Alzheimer's disease conference. The data has been previewed already by Lilly‚Äôs chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, who said: ‚ÄúFrom our own analysis and the small number of experts we‚Äôve shared the data with, we surely believe a very substantial advance in Alzheimer‚Äôs research has been accomplished.‚Äù

We held through weeks of red, through weeks of discouragement, three weeks of name calling and market manipulation, and now it‚Äôs time to enter THE MF PROMISE LAND!!!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM

But, the only way we can do this together.

Remember why were here, remember what we went through, remember the goal.

As long as we continue to hold GameStop, and buy through whatever (Whether it be short ladder attacks, market manipulation, or bots flooding this page telling us it‚Äôs over)  we can make history.üöÄ

We are looking at potentially largest wealth redistribution in history! Something our kids, grandkids, wife‚Äôs boyfriend, will look back upon with a smile! Knowing that we did it.

We need to hold, a few weeks ago people said $100 wouldn‚Äôt happen a week ago with RKT they said GameStop was dead, and $200 would never be reached, but we held.ü¶ßü¶ßü¶ßü¶ßü¶ß

Now I‚Äôve been skeptical, about game stops potential to reach $800, or even $1000, but with the past five days my skepticism has turned into optimism. Thanks to you, my fellow apes, I can now say confidently that not only can we do this but we can exceed it!

Remember to hold! We determine the price! If you sell off at $400 it will end, this is our opportunity, our Trojan horse, our 300 Sparta, if we hold we can determine the price to $800, $900, $1000, $2000. üçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå

The next few days will be rough, but glorious. We will succeed and we will rewrite history in the process. Thank you apes for joining together we will rewrite historyüöÄü¶ßüçå

TL:DR-  We determine the price, through weeks we held and held through thick and thin. And now it is time for us to make history. Remember we determine the price! If you sell it for $200 then it is all for nothing. Our realistic price should be $800, so let‚Äôs get there, and let‚Äôs get farther! Alone Ape week, together Ape strong! ü¶ßü¶ßü¶ßü¶ßü¶ß

60,m0tqk2,"In 2009 I was working for a Wall Street firm supplying a network of industry experts to our hedge fund clients. Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he'd just left the company. I didn't know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd's only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at a distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I'd make sure we had that.

On any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn't listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information and wanted to stay out of prison. They said I probably knew what was going on but had no emails or recordings to back that up. They all walked and I got hammered with a 30 month prison sentence. So that's how you go to prison for insider trading without actually trading. It's all true! Just Google James Fleishman.

My last route had cover a 100 customers‚ÄîI sold to rid myself of labor issues and AGAIN in debt. Since college I have driven a taxi all summer long (6pm to 6am typical shift). Uber hates their drivers and after 1500 premium trips I am done. I actually tried to get my 14yo my old job last summer as a caddy....well now I have to explain to my kids that I carry rich ppls golf clubs at 44.

SO:
The bottom line is some of us got the shaft without gasoline‚Äôs. You mofos that sell will never get anywhere. You ll take your $ to spend on horse shit. We all got screwed by institutions, now is not the time to feel weak. Keep you shit together 

Hodl like it‚Äôs your MFing job: It‚Äôs THE ONLY WAY to win. Make those ü¶ç s at $390 winners like Too. That‚Äôs my $00.02 and I will see you bitches in VALHALLA!!!!!

Rocket üöÄ You guys bitch and moan about 2008 and getting shitty degrees. However, I ve had to buy 4 houses to get one in a decent neighborhood to raise a gamut. Albeit 1 invaded by illegals and the Schools are 52% Spanish. So my kids go to private school on top of the $13k year inNYS Taxes. 

FYI to buy in NYS it cost $14k per closing. $ you never see. The first house was in a neighborhood where I was afraid to break down in college (built my own VW Rabbit). My 3rd house was 365 in ‚Äò06 and is worth 365 thanks to Mr. DeBlasio. The mortgage was 6 3/8 and not a federal loan. So when I bought #4 with retirement loans I stopped paying on #3. After 20 mos the cock suckers finally would engage in conversation and modified a dreamy loan for me.  I destroyed my credit to 610. I have üíé balls. I came out on top. You mofos that sell will never get anywhere and you ll take your $ to spend on horse shit. We all got screwed by institutions, ones not the time to feel weak. Keep you shit together 

Hodl like it‚Äôs your MFing job: It‚Äôs THE ONLY WAY to win. Make those ü¶ç s at $390 winners like Too.

See you bitches in VALHALLA.

83,m0tues,"I  get it. You want our darling stock to go to the moon. I do too - I held  25 shares from $300 up to $483 and back down, and I averaged down holding all the way to the 30s and now I'm holding 170 shares. I intend to keep holding them. But when you call people bitches or pussies for taking a profit, you are giving ammunition for anyone to call WSB a plump and dumpling (actual words forbidden) forum, because those tactics are what plump and dumplingers use so they can exit confidently at the highest price. You're also feeding the narrative that WSB is acting as a single entity because you're deliberately trying to coerce someone into taking a particular action by verbally harassing them.

So here's my advice: if you *are* trying to P&amp;D our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a üßªü§≤.
