36,m0tkeo,"Potentially huge news coming this week.

Eli Lily shocked everyone in January with a preliminary report that their new drug **slowed the effects of Alzheimer's BY 32%**. The stock jumped almost 12% on the news, but most analysts have been waiting on actual details to verify their results. 

**Those details are coming THIS SATURDAY, March 13th** at the Alzheimer's disease conference. The data has been previewed already by Lilly’s chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, who said: “From our own analysis and the small number of experts we’ve shared the data with, we surely believe a very substantial advance in Alzheimer’s research has been accomplished.”

This is not advice, just my own opinion:

***I am all in on shares and options with about $27k.***

Second, from my experience the only reason people doubt this is that they do not understand the fundamentals of a short squeeze. WE PICK THE PRICE. Its not a pump and dump and that's not why it can go to 1000000000$. If you don't understand why any price we pick is possible, do some research on what a short squeeze means, and figure out why &gt;100% shorted enables us 🦍 to take a 🚀 to the 🌕 as long as we all HODL.

We held through weeks of red, through weeks of discouragement, three weeks of name calling and market manipulation, and now it’s time to enter THE MF PROMISE LAND!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀

TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM

But, the only way we can do this together.

Remember why were here, remember what we went through, remember the goal.

As long as we continue to hold GameStop, and buy through whatever (Whether it be short ladder attacks, market manipulation, or bots flooding this page telling us it’s over)  we can make history.🚀

We are looking at potentially largest wealth redistribution in history! Something our kids, grandkids, wife’s boyfriend, will look back upon with a smile! Knowing that we did it.

We need to hold, a few weeks ago people said $100 wouldn’t happen a week ago with RKT they said GameStop was dead, and $200 would never be reached, but we held.🦧🦧🦧🦧🦧

Now I’ve been skeptical, about game stops potential to reach $800, or even $1000, but with the past five days my skepticism has turned into optimism. Thanks to you, my fellow apes, I can now say confidently that not only can we do this but we can exceed it!

Remember to hold! We determine the price! If you sell off at $400 it will end, this is our opportunity, our Trojan horse, our 300 Sparta, if we hold we can determine the price to $800, $900, $1000, $2000. 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

The next few days will be rough, but glorious. We will succeed and we will rewrite history in the process. Thank you apes for joining together we will rewrite history🚀🦧🍌

TL:DR-  We determine the price, through weeks we held and held through thick and thin. And now it is time for us to make history. Remember we determine the price! If you sell it for $200 then it is all for nothing. Our realistic price should be $800, so let’s get there, and let’s get farther! Alone Ape week, together Ape strong! 🦧🦧🦧🦧🦧

Now let’s get those tendies!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌

60,m0tqk2,"In 2009 I was working for a Wall Street firm supplying a network of industry experts to our hedge fund clients. Clients paid a fee for access to thousands of contacts they could connect with through calls. One of my biggest clients was a research analyst, Jesse Turturro, at Diamondback Capital and he'd just left the company. I didn't know why he left but knew I had to talk to his boss to save the business. So I met with Todd Newman in his office in Stamford, Connecticut and explained how his analyst was gaining value doing fundamental research through our service. Todd's only concern was that one particular contact in our network who worked at a distributor had permission from his company to talk about his dealings with the semiconductor companies that Diamondback was interested in. I told Todd I'd make sure we had that.

On any given day our clients might do 20 or 30 calls. I didn't listen to the calls but the FBI did. They had a wiretap on us when I met with Newman and his analyst was cooperating with a massive insider trading investigation. They charged Newman with insider trading, saying he knew his analyst knew he was collecting insider information which Diamondback was trading on. He went to trial and lost but won on appeal. They charged me on conspiracy charges, saying I knew our clients were getting inside information on these calls. There were no trades presented at my trial. There were no clients saying I gave them inside information. Just a couple consultants who had been giving out inside information and wanted to stay out of prison. They said I probably knew what was going on but had no emails or recordings to back that up. They all walked and I got hammered with a 30 month prison sentence. So that's how you go to prison for insider trading without actually trading. It's all true! Just Google James Fleishman.

So here's my advice: if you *are* trying to pump and dump our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a 🧻🤲.

Albeit 1 in a “sanctuary city” and Obama shipped illegals and now the Schools are 52% Spanish. So my kids go to private school on top of the $13k year inNYS Taxes. Soon to be $16k/yr, then 24k

FYI to buy in NYS it cost $14k per closing. $ you never see. The first house was in a neighborhood where I was afraid to break down in college (built my own VW Rabbit). My 3rd house was 365 in ‘06 and is only now worth 365k thanks to Mr. DeBlasio (NYC Mayor) The mortgage was 6 3/8 and not a federal loan. NOBODY WOULD TALK TO ME AT THE BANK to refi. So when I bought #4 with retirement loans I stopped paying on #3. After 20 mos the cock suckers finally would engage in conversation and modified a dreamy loan for me.  I destroyed my credit to 610. I now have been blessed with💎 balls. 

I played the game the right way, got screwed. then flipped the script. Eventually I came out on top. I sold 3 landscaping businesses and started one in the fall 2008. Ppl coming home saying their bosses took over their jobs. The ppl couldn’t pay and the Americans were worthless as workers. My last route had cover a 100 customers—I sold to rid myself of labor issues and AGAIN in debt. Since college I have driven a taxi all summer long (6pm to 6am typical shift). Uber hates their drivers and after 1500 premium trips I am done.

After 20 mos the cock suckers finally would engage in conversation and modified a dreamy loan for me.  I destroyed my credit to 610. I have 💎 balls. I came out on top. You mofos that sell will never get anywhere and you ll take your $ to spend on horse shit. We all got screwed by institutions, ones not the time to feel weak. Keep you shit together 

Hodl like it’s your MFing job: It’s THE ONLY WAY to win. Make those 🦍 s at $390 winners like Too.

See you bitches in VALHALLA.

83,m0tues,"I  get it. You want our darling stock to go to the moon. I do too - I held  25 shares from $300 up to $483 and back down, and I averaged down holding all the way to the 30s and now I'm holding 170 shares. I intend to keep holding them. But when you call people bitches or pussies for taking a profit, you are giving ammunition for anyone to call WSB a plump and dumpling (actual words forbidden) forum, because those tactics are what plump and dumplingers use so they can exit confidently at the highest price. You're also feeding the narrative that WSB is acting as a single entity because you're deliberately trying to coerce someone into taking a particular action by verbally harassing them.

So here's my advice: if you *are* trying to P&amp;D our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a 🧻🤲.

See you on the moon friends. Please be respectful.","If you don't want WSB to be perceived as one entity, or a certain stock to be perceived as a P&amp;D scheme, then stop bullying people for their trading decisions",1.0,1615248112,sqwave

99,m0tw3f,"I downloaded Webull and attempted to deposit $100 to invest in GME the following Monday, but it took over a day to transfer it to from my bank before I could invest it in the stock. By the time I had it available, it had already jumped to $120, so I tried to put in another $40 to catch it in time but had to wait another day for the funds to deposit, and by that time it had already jumped to $150, and now it’s at $190! Now I feel like just taking my money out and just forgetting about GME even though I’m almost broke, working a full commission job I hardly make any money in.
