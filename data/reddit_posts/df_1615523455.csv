When the GME spike happened in January, I of course, late to the party, bought a little at $290 (as the price dropped), then a little more at $230 (when the price kept dropping), a bit more at $190 (when the price kept dropping.  Long story short, I found myself in about $5K more than i had planned and suddenly the stock was in the $40's.  For a while.  An uncomfortably long time really.  I started to tell myself what a mistake I made.  I started following the WSB thingy here, and reading the DD, comments and everything and I really bought into all of this.  Made me feel much more comfortable about risk vs potential reward and the once in a lifetime chance that this really is to stick it to the system.  Bought a bunch more at $46 finding myself at 100 shares at $114 average right before this last liftoff.  Bought 20 more for $185 during yesterday's dip. Seems I'm an expert now just like all of you.

84,m3a790,"I started on this AMC wagon now since early last month and started with 25 shares. The more I watched this stock get attacked, media trying to influence, and hedge funders manipulating the markets the more I went in. The more they attack and use shady tactics the more I get pissed off and buy, the more the media pushes us to sell the more I buy, and when Hedgefucks dilute counterfeit shares into the market I just keep buying. I am now up to 1000 shares of this stock and my brother has another 1500 we are holding. When they attacked today I liquidated other stock and doubled down on AMC. All you apes out there don’t be scared with BS games these bastards are terrified of what will happen when they finally realize they underestimated our dumb asses!! This isn’t over yet and I hope they try to short this stock more because once that stimulus hits I will be sure to buy every cent worth on AMC while giving my hedge buddies the middle finger!!

89,m3a9hw,"Should I spend my stimulus money now (buy the dip?) before everyone else floods the market with their $1400 checks?

On the chance that the retail investors getting their checks will affect the market to go greener (if the stimulus checks aren’t completely ‘priced in’) should I to take out $1400 now  from my savings to invest in order to beat the crowd? 

Disclosure: I have not received my stimulus (duh) and I was waiting to receive it in the bank before I invested it but I was thinking that is what most retail investors will be same thing thus pushing prices higher than they would be if I could have invested today (typing this I realize that because this is my presumption that the market could and will likely do the exact opposite). 

Tech stocks are not back to their all time highs so part of me wonders if that still counts as ‘a dip’? Apple still seems like a good value but I was mostly going to invest in VTI, QQQ and maybe some more SQ with the money. 

Am I making a classic mistake in trying to time the market or am I being proactive about my investments?

 GME public offering of 200 million additional shares at the bargain price of $2,694.20

Let me preface this by saying I believe there are a ton of fake shares floating around unreported.

If any of the shares sell it obviously means there were fake shares created. 

There would be incentive to buy shares at any price below the public offering as soon as possible.

A special dividend could be given to all share holders once the public offering has finalized. GameStop of course would hold back funding needed for the future endeavors into new markets.

Depending on how many shares are sold at the public offering the dividend could be significant perhaps $2000 a share.

What am I missing?","Could GME do public offering 200M @ 2,694.20 followed by a special dividend for share holders?",1.0,1615525348,Dagamoth

92,m3aack,"Hi WSB. Recently I've noticed a few Redditors linking articles by The Motley Fool. From what I've seen of their content, their article titles seem very formulaic, and their content is usually gated after reading the first paragraph, requiring you to hit a seemingly arbitrary button to see the whole article. The full articles don't seem to strongly support their chosen titles, which appear very concentrated on media trends, and yet they are all over Yahoo! Finance (I know this doesn't suggest credibility, but the abundance of their ads being hosted got my attention). What's their deal? Has anyone found them reliable in the past, or are they just farming clicks and selling baseless stories?
