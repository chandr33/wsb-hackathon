200-day moving average (yellow line)  
50-day moving average (purple)  
20-day moving average (green)  


Share price has broken above the 200-day moving average, which was our previous upwards resistance, and our three average lines are showing strong support north of $25. Technicals indicate upward momentum and a supported floor $24.33.   


**Key Trending Ideas:**

**Yield Curve is taking a break from freaking out (bullish for RKT)**

*Processing img jd0kimikv8n61...*

  
**Housing data comes out March 17th (very important)**  
This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.   
Oh and it will stay that way because:

1, Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.  
2, Employment is strengthening: This is always a great thing for hosuing.  
3, Economy is re-bounding: This is always a great thing for housing.  
4, Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.  
5, Low rates continue: This motivates younger people to finally own something for a change.

**Shorts are still there:**   
As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000 (that's a lot of bananas), 6% fee.   


During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

More things this week... Jpowell speaks... He probably will not say anything surprising but markets hang on his every word and the 10-year treasury seems to care a lot. We will keep an eye on that even though the rate is still incredibly historically low.   


March 22nd RKT dividends are paid out to holders on record date. Most RKTers re-invest in more shares. It will be strong momentum.  


**TLDR:**

The price is not going lower. The floor is found. Great trending and indicators blinking! Strap in and enjoy the ride. RKT is for short, medium AND long term investors. It's got something for everyone, that's why I like it.",$RKT PRE-FUELING for Alpha Centauri! All aboard!,0.5,1615837485,bosshax

34,m5t6x5,"This Orange is ready to be juiced!

FNKO - yes Funko, that company that makes the wonderful toys that we all like to put on our desks and never open, is a publicly traded company, in fact they trade on the Nasdaq and have a share price of roughly $19, with a market cap of just over $750Million.

THE NUMBERS:

Share Price - $19

Market Cap - $750 Million

Shares Outstanding - 35.61 Million

Short interest - 2.33 Million, 4.7% of total shares, 11.37% of float

Institutional Ownership - 71 %, 25.31 Million

Total Shares Available Outside of Institutions - 10.3 Million, $192.7 Million

% of non-institutional shares shorted - 22.6%, $44.27 Million

Number of members on WSB - 9.5 Million

In short FNKO is a heavily Institutionally Owned company, with 71% of the shares owned by institutional investors; FNKO is also a heavily shorted company, 4.7% of shares may not seem high, but this translates to 22.6% of non-institutionally owned shares, if there was a need to cover an entire short position those shares would have to be purchased from the pool of only 10.3 Million retail owned shares. With 10.3 Million shares averaging roughly $19 per share it would cost WSB members less than $19 each, less than 1 share per member, to corner so much of the non-institutional float that the 2.33 million short shares would be left fighting over only 800,000 shares. It‚Äôs not as obvious as other shorts as the numbers don‚Äôt seem huge on the surface, but if you look just under the surface you will see that this Orange is ripe to be squeezed. At roughly $21 per WSB member we could literally control the float of this stock.

On an actual product DD basis FNKO will benefit from the return to offices, at least half of the Funko Pops that I see sit on desks and probably 1/4 are given at company events and Christmas parties.

On the DD front that no one understands they are about to delve into NFTs, non-fungible tokens, basically an intellectual property scam that is currently making individuals millions and will make artistic companies billions, and guess what? This Orange makes a lot of art! You don‚Äôt need to understand the NFT market, you just need to know that it is currently cool and people pay lots of money for it.

A spike in FNKOs price from return to office and the coming NFT boom, combined with WSB buying the entire float, combined with a relatively high short interest makes this Orange ready to be juiced by some big strong Ape hands.

TLDR - If Apes buy FNKO they will squeeze and Apes will receive lots of bananas.","FNKO - high short interest, low mkt cap, news no one understands",1.0,1615837793,dan42183

Reddit appears to me to be entirely either people who bought stock and want others to do the same (i.e., confirmation bias, pumping the stock, etc.) or Dunning-Kruger effect (i.e., someone has made incredible gains since last March as the market just exploded and now everyone thinks they‚Äôre Warren Buffet).

95,m5te8b,"I have been following the group and progress, while i want to join in the fun, i feel it would be unwise at this time since my cash has been set aside to build a stray animal shelter in Mexico called [https://sanctuaryhostel.org/](https://sanctuaryhostel.org/), it will also be a hostel so feel free to visit us after we are built, unfortunately, we don't have the space for furry apes, just the human kind  


Since many are being selfless by using their gains to help animals it would be selfish of me to use the set aside cash for stocks when its been reserved already  


Mexican non profits don't have as many resources as those in the US and the stray problem is much worse there, perhaps after its built i will have some left over for WSB",Cant join the GME train as money is held for animal shelter project,1.0,1615838342,xboxhaxorz
96,m5teo4,"That's right I said it. If you apes don't evolve we're all fucked. You're all high on dopamine if you don't think we suffered a major loss on Friday. Massive amounts of open interest was obliterated because we couldn't cross the 300 line. It hasn't come back either, grow some brain cells and google the open interest for 3/19 for your own damn self. It's not even half of what was there last Friday. We're playing a high stakes game against some of the richest motherfuckers on this planet. If you think all you have to do at this point is hold what you have we are absolutely and totally fucked. The hedgefunds are the loggers and the open interest is the Amazon fucking forest. Guess what? It's on fucking fire. You need to plant some fucking trees by buying as close to ITM calls as you can, and water those bitches with shares, or there's going to be nothing left. You wanna fight the big boys? Well the big boys have everything on the line when it comes to GME, so they aren't going to hold back. You have rent to pay, so we all understand why you don't go all in, but how can we win if we won't? There's one thing the hedgefunds don't have that we do, and it just might save our asses, stimmy checks.",GameStop is Over,1.0,1615838374,FutureYou1

Listen up:

A fellow ape u/Vestwak was smart and deep enough to find ‚ÄûWKN A3KM4‚Äú

What is that? Why thanks for asking since you seem to miss my headline.If you are a good ape and do your own research you find, but for those that need it on a diamond platter:

Ah the sweetness of it. It tastes like rocket fuel to me.

I feel that my shares are cuddling in bed with me and I will hold them like I hold Melvins wife when I call her over.

**That 600.000.000$ will be good enough just for 300 shares sadly**.

I do NOT pity the boomer that thinks the return of 3,75% till 2026 is a good deal. Since my guess is, there will not be anything of Shitadel left in 2026 after the thruster blast burst them to the earth core.

I keep HODLING, what about YOU?

And that is 600 Million, not Billion. Sorry to disappoint, but no, that is not that much even if I would like that, but somebody else is going to pay up for your shares.",CITADEL BORROWS 600.000.000$ !!! 600 MILLION $ üíéü§≤üèª üöÄüöÄüöÄ,1.0,1615838385,W0t4N
