This isn’t a matter of whether we can afford $10/month. 20 uploads is nothing. One project can use 20 uploads. This machine was marketed as having a free design program with unlimited uploads and the phrase “creativity should be free”. This machine can ONLY be used with their program. It’s not even a good program. People are designing outside of Design Space and then uploading just to be cut. This is comparable to buying a printer and being told you can print up to 20 documents a month. They want to charge us a premium price for a horrible program. This is the same monthly price of Photoshop to put it in perspective. This is a deplorable money grab by Cricut who is preparing to go public.

The memestock shares you own probably don't exist (yet). They are created out of thin air because app traders are not supposed to hold. If you buy the stock they have weeks of time to actually deliver it to you. Every single time you exit a trade in order to make a new one at a better cost basis you are slowing the rocket down. Because you reset the time frame for your stock to actually get bought on the market. They bet on you resetting the time frame. That is why they are not just moving GME but the whole market. That is why AMC and GME trade the same. Algos are identical for this situation. People are holding. Wiggle them out.

DON'T GET WIGGLED OUT. NOT EVEN FOR PROFIT. YOU RESET THE TIMEFRAME FOR YOUR SHARES TO GET DELIVERED.

That is also why I am certain $Rocket was a shill op. People thought they were smart by hoping onto $Rocket and take the gains back to GME. But this didn't help the cause at all. Hedgies already sold way more than the existing amount of shares of GME. They are fucked no matter what. But by getting people out of GME even for a short period of time, all FTD timelines for those stocks got reset. So you just gave them more time to breathe.

At this point the only thing that keeps this rocket from going of is daytraders. GME will moon. You just don't have to overthink it. I buy when its red and hold when its green. That is all that is necessary in this situation.

They can never get out of this again and the price has no logical limits.

18,m45rkh,"Real talk: Congress is getting started on the infrastructure bill and the majority leader in the Senate plans on a bill passage by October. It should climate focused considering that the Biden administration ran on that message. One of Biden’s initiatives was building a network of charging station across America. Another one is making modern changes to the power grid system and alternative ways to harness energy. Of courses the materials to build these priorities takes steel and fuel.

Based on these assumptions mixed in with a few facts about the materials that will be used to modernize our infrastructure, as other analysts have reiterated, this is a great year for energy and materials. They like to think about the reopening which I think is short-sighted. The real growth will come from the rumor out of Congress. That’s going to be the accelerant for a lot of these alternative energy stocks.

Here are some on my watch list:
MP Materials
Star Peak Energy (soon to be STEM this month)
ChargePoint

MP Materials 

• Not a fan all too much for this one, and it has a competitive advantage that’s also its greatest weakness. They are the only rare earth material miner in the US. It only takes a competitor with lower prices to soak up their market share. A little apprehensive about this one but I like their team. Maybe you guys have more information on what makes this one stellar.

Star Peak Energy 

• This one is a good one in my opinion for its uniqueness. Other green tech stocks in its sector are trading at much much higher multiples like Blink whereas this company is only 8x. So, it’s trading at a discount from its peers. They offer energy solutions driven by their patented AI system Athena to harness power from energy storage units. They also plan to be cash flow positive by 2022-2023. That’s beside the point though, they’re pioneering great sustainable technology and already have a 75% market share in California in energy storage. I like this one a lot. They’re planning a merger with Stem this month and it will be listed in the NYSE as STEM. 

ChargePoint 

• The company has the widest distribution of charging units across the country. Though they aren’t as good as other chargers in their sector, they have them at scale. This play is largely contingent on the infrastructure bill. GM plans to have like 30 EV cars by 2025, so just imagine the growth story for this stock. Even at its current multiple, I can honestly say that Biden’s proposal is not factored in. They’re going to be met with more demand than they projected in a few years as more and more people embrace EV’s.",Green-Centric Technology Set to Benefit from Infrastructure Spending,1.0,1615640183,blaclaureate

23,m45sww,"Hello fellow Apes.

So I'm a EuroTard who uses Etoro, I have 195 GME shares, including the last 10 that I bought yesterday @ 265$, right before the market closed. The other 185 shares are at an average of 140$, or something around that number.

This morning I receive an email telling me that I'm finally verified, and can join the Degiro app now. Which has the AMC stock.

So now I'm wondering, should I just stick to GME. Or should I paperhand the 10 shares I bought yesterday (as it's still breaking even), and diamondhand them on AMC, when the market opens on Monday?

So, what would be the most retarded move for me to make now?

But I now realize our beloved market is at risk from these too and the only way to fight it is awareness. Think about if a fake Elon saying Tesla is buying billions of dog🪙 or a YouTube video from Ryan Cohen with all sorts of exciting news only to learn a day later it was completely fake.

I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm  stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe to and  promote the notion that at current MC of \~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i  mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the  only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who  like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last  bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of  nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in  their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex  calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring  and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc.  etc.

\-  well you know what

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)

Market  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );

I  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more ""over-valued"" than some of the market ""darlings"" currently trading at considerable premium)

To  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)
