95,lwrbfm," Nokia's Networks Margin Situation:  


In 2021, networks division is projected to have 0% profit margin.  
In 2020, Nokia's networks division had higher than imagined margins due to product cost reductions as ReefShark shipments of 43% was well above the targeted 35%. This resulted in an excellent earnings report.  
The type of results Nokia achieved in 2020 should have caused the stock to soar but it didn't as the Verizon loss was very significant for Nokia and it will cause a ""challanging 2021"" per Pekka Lundmark.  


Having said that, if in 2021, the 70% ReefShark shipment goal is exceeded, it would be a giant step towards having better than 0% margins. There will be top and bottom line pressures due to Verizon loss and increased R&amp;D spending. However, each 1 percent point increase in Networks margin means about 100 million Euros in pure profit (directly goes to the bottom line since expenses are largely fixed). Each additional profit margin increment means higher EPS which has almost perfect correlation with the share price.  


Networks division has the following customer types:  
CSPs (such as Verizon): 18 billion Euros  
Enterprise: 1.6 billion Euros  
Licensees: 1.4 billion Euros  
Other (ASN and RFS): 861 million Euros  


The unfortunate situation we are in is the CSP revenues are going down. Since, North America is a favorable region for margins, Verizon loss will cause a higher damage to Nokia's profitability than say if they lost a Latin American customer.  
YoY constant currency revenue change for the CSP subset is -5%. Since this is the biggest subset of Nokia, it is obviously causing all the problems we are facing today.  


However, the big opportunity here is the Enterprise market. It is relatively small as of 2020. However, within just a few months, if my memory serves me right, Nokia increased its Enterprise customers from 70 to 260 (probably a lot more now. We'll see in Q1 2021 earnings report. I am very interested in this number as it might not only negate the CSP concerns for the upcoming years, but it might become a giant revenue and margin provider for Nokia.)  


[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/)  


[https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/)  


As of 2020, Enterprise subset revenue is only 1.6 billion Euros. HOWEVER, it is growing at 14% in constant currency YoY. Since, Enterprise market is newly developing, and per Pekka Lundmark, Nokia is a leader, this subset could objectively become the driver for Nokia to reach $20 and beyond.  


Do me a favor and google private 5G/Enterprise market growth projections or take a look at this article.  . [https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/](https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/)  You will see that the 14% annual growth is VERY conservative. This opportunity here for us shareholders is not pure positivity, lying, deceiving or some unachievable dream but is a reality as it is happening right NOW. Not in 2-3 years, not in 5 years but right now.  


Also, the bigger opportunity with the Enterprise market is not only the revenues will soar year after year but that the profit margins are much better than the global CSP market per Pekka Lundmark. As we know the profits directly effect EPS and EPS directly effects the share price.  


Having said that, I think 2021 will still be challanging due to the Verizon loss as it was a GIANT loss. It is really hard to make up for that loss in less than a year. However, the near future objectively looks bright. The million dollar question is how quickly will Nokia negate the Verizon loss and how quickly will the Enterprise subset become very significant. Based on a conservative 15% growth rate, this subset will bring in 1.8 billion Euros and a minimum of about 180 million Euros in 2021. IF Nokia exceeds these expectations, I would become even more bullish than $20 per share. Don't forget, Nokia is projecting to be breakeven in the networks division only for 2021. Afterwards, Nokia says it will significantly improve the margins. If Nokia gets somewhat close to what Ericsson is achieving in PMs, it will have around 12-15% in networks margin. That will bring in 1-1.5 billion Euros in additional profits per year. That would alone cause the stock price to at least triple from its current price.  


The truth is, there are risks in the short term. The stock might go down to low $3 range after March 18th if Pekka Lundmark gives a poor forward guidance. However, the potential is there and it is in motion right now. It is not a pipe dream. Unless Pekka Lundmark talks negatively about the Enterprise markets future, I am here to stay.  


Nokia stock in my opinion has probably one of the best risk reward ratios in the market right now.",DD: Nokia,0.81,1614769571,Sonerb81
