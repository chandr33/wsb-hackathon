20,m6gon4,"No advice will be found here just one apes thoughts who buys high and sells low

Now imma tell this as I understand it, please do correct me if I'm wrong. Also explaining this also helps me to understand it.

Imagine one GME share is equal to one 🍌, we can understand that. Now, the 🌈🐻 see those Gamestop shares as mouldy 🍌, so they think that they will be worthless and decided to say to Gamestop, ""We'll buy those 🍌 now"" back in 2020 when this all started, with an agreement that they would sell those exact 🍌back to Gamestop in the future for a lower value. (That's how a short works).

Now the man, myth and not cat [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) comes in and sees that actually its just a mouldy skin on the 🍌and the inside is pure gold. He decides he wants to buy lots of the mouldy 🍌because he sees their deep fucking value. He posts some of his findings on the 🍌 forums and people are excited and want to buy gold 🍌.

Now it's January and lots of apes are buying many 🍌 that hopefully will be gold inside, but they're not sure. The deadline for the 🌈🐻 to return those mouldy 🍌 for less, is fast approaching, but they already sold their mouldy 🍌 to make their gains when they first bought them. But with all the potential of these being gold 🍌 , there are no 🍌 left in the gamestop shop. 🌈🐻 are now scared.

Apes started to peel open their 🍌 around Jan w/c 25th. Apes would've made big tendies if apes opened 🍌 then. 🌈🐻 would have been able to buy them all back but at a significant loss which 🌈🐻 get angry about because 🌈🐻 are very fragile inside.

Angry 🌈🐻 decide to shut all the shops where apes can buy 🍌. This stops the apes from opening their 🍌and the belief that they are *actually* gold inside fades away. Meanwhile, 🌈🐻 go to another shop and start buying normal 🍌 which are not definitely not gold inside but look like the mouldy 🍌all the apes want. (This is why the float % is above 100%, because there are fake gold 🍌 in the market.)

Now this gives some time for the 🌈🐻 to be able to buy back the original 🍌 as the belief and price of all the 🍌falls. Some of the chimps sell their potential gold 🍌because they are scared that they might not actually be real gold inside, lowering the price even more.

Meanwhile, king ape [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/) is being threatened with ape jail because he made🌈🐻 angry. King ape has big balls and still believes they are gold inside and doubles the amount of 🍌 he has. Apes go mad and start to buy more 🍌 whether they are gold or not. 🍌are good for apes, even if they are not gold inside.

Whilst 🌈🐻 are trying to find the real gold 🍌that they promised to give back in their first trade they keep promising more and more and more to buy themselves some time. Well the people who regulate the shops we buy 🍌from are started to get pissed of by 🌈🐻 being angry and breaking stuff. So they propose to change the rules so that the 🌈🐻 MUST give back the original 🍌within a much shorter period (previously 21 days, potentially 2 days if upcoming changes pass).

🌈🐻 have many tricks in their fur, they can roar at ape like ' 🍌ARE BAD', 'DONT BUY 🍌', 'WE ALREADY CLOSED (covered) OUR ORIGINAL TRADE'. Well, ape is dumb but no moron, why would 🌈🐻still be angry and shouting if they had fixed their problem? Ape smells bearshit.

A culmination of king big balls [u/Deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalue/), 🌈🐻 getting more angry, many fake ape bots saying 🍌are not good, the regulators of 🍌shop changing the rules, ape president giving money to 80% of apes so they could buy more 🍌, papa Cohen hired into 🍌 growing company, all point towards this not being over and there are still gold 🍌 in the market that the 🌈🐻 really really need.

Apes start to hear rumour that papa Cohen might lead the 🍌 growing company, and that 🍌growing company is about to release its earnings over the Christmas holidays (Remember how all those next gen consoles got sold out), and that 🍌growing company might recall all of those original bananas to hold an ape meeting. If original 🍌 are recalled then 🌈🐻 MUST find them, and will involve them buying many 🍌 to get them to their ape owners.

🌈🐻 Are getting very angry and running out of tactics to make apes let go of 🍌. But guess what? Ape loves 🍌 more than ever. Ape enjoys 🌈🐻being angry, because 🌈🐻 fucked many ape families years ago.

Some smooth brained apes think they could sell their 🍌for a good price now to buy MORE 🍌later. Well what if ape sold some of those gold 🍌? and instead bought mouldy ones later?

If any of these situations arose where 🌈🐻 need to find the original 🍌, then 🌈🐻 is fuk because there are potentially up to 900% more 🍌than when this all started, and ape can demand what ape wants to sell their 🍌 for. Many apes want $1,000,000 for their 🍌, but the longer 🌈🐻take, then ape can ask for more.

**What if** 🌈🐻 **hasn't got that much money to buy all 🍌for a milli each?**

Well then the shop regulators will sell all of the 🌈🐻 apples and oranges and pears to make sure they have enough for the 🍌.

**What if they still don't have enough money?**

Then those regulators have a money printing machine and ape government has reserves for this.

**TLDR: Ape loves 🍌. 🍌may be gold inside, so ape never letting go of 🍌he already has, only buying more.** 🌈🐻 **are angry are apes for winning.**

Please correct me if I made some mistakes or could add to my analogy. There are MANY smart apes in this treehouse, and I have learnt a lot from them in only a couple months. Be grateful.

Put in what article info I could in case of a pay-wall-block

GameStop stock dropped again shortly after the market opened on Tuesday. While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.

Shares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock’s one-year low of $2.57.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron’s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.

Dusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.

“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky added.

The company’s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop’s parabolic ascent.
GameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit’s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.

I would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.","Barron’s: GameStop Stock Tumbles, but Analyst Still Sees Squeeze Potential",1.0,1615921963,Substantial_Flow_943
