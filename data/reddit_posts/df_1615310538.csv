88,m1bkbn,"Hello Reddit.

I wasn't sure where else to share this but I'm looking for an explanation as to why Wealthsimple / the brokers have done this.

On 2021-03-09 at 12:05 I initiated a sell order of x shares of FLYHT Aerospace Solutions Ltd.

The official reported stock price was 0.81 cents per share and I was undersold by 2 cents at 0.79 cents per share (I was undersold with a 2.5% difference in stock price and what they gave me).

I then immediately initiated a buy of 1 share out of curiosity and it was purchased at 0.81 cents. I went back to initiate a sell on that share right after. That share then immediately sold for 0.79 cents.

Why is this happening and where is that 2.5% gain I should be receiving?

If they show the share price at 0.81 cents, and FLY.V reports the share price at 0.81 cents, but they can sell at 0.79 whenever they feel what am I even doing on Wealthsimple?",Wealthsimple Ripping Off Traders?,1.0,1615311154,TheVigilantWolf

93,m1bkmb,"$UCL uCloudlink is an innovative mobile technology company established to offer the world's leading mobile data traffic sharing marketplace based on Cloud SIM technology. We provide the best global mobile data services to billions of users in over 140 countries and regions.

What do they do?

Essentially, you sign up as a customer to use their SIM and wifi services on your mobile device, like a phone plan. However, you are not tied down to a provider. You have access to ALL the providers that are partnered with them. This means, you will get the best service no matter where you are. If you have better service with AT&amp;T in New York City and better Verizon in Tokyo, you will use those respectively. This is huge. You will not have to be tied down with a provider. You can utilize all the providers. 

UCL was named the most innovative 5G company recently and I expect this will continue. Decentralized cellular and wifi services are in huge demand. The ability to use whichever is best based on location an attractive offering. 

They offer a PaaS and Sass product which optimizes supply and demand of SIM resources based on usage and location to provide enhanced performance for their customers as a whole. 

Why am I buying this stock?

This company is killing it financially. Revenue growth has been growing from 126M to 158M 2018-2019 and has increased since then. The profit margin is crazy with 65M on 160M revenue, which leaves 15M a year to R&amp;D. The best growth companies always operate at a loss to pump money back into the company. Even still, they turned 5.21M in Net Income.

UCL is a fairly new company that recently flopped it's IPO, which looks like an excellent buying opportunity. They are continuing to grow in Asia and have recently expanded their footprint in the North America with new partners in the US and Canada. 

They have a huge opportunity to grow, with not a lot of room to go down based on financials and growth alone. 

With the technology that this company is innovating, I find it hard not to throw some money this way.",uCloudLink $UCL DD,1.0,1615311175,octagonal_rutabaga
