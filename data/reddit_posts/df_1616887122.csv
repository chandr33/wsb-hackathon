23,mepvbh,"It's the weekend, it's nice out (where i'm from) and i'm tired of reading about $GME posts (don't worry am holding).  


I want to to introduce you to a company called Camping World.  
[https://imgur.com/8liSv71](https://imgur.com/8liSv71)  
Your immediate reaction is probably something along the lines of - why is this retard talking about RV's. Well, these kind of trades are my bread and butter and how largely how i've been able to make more trading full time, than with the businesses I own outside of it.   


I started thinking about CWH after reading twitter, and seeing some comments about RV's,  camping, road trips, and people dying to get out of their house after a long winter. So - I immediately thought I should check the chart and use some crayons.  


[https://imgur.com/J0vXauS](https://imgur.com/J0vXauS)  
Like most of the market, there has been sell off, but this chart allows us to see a defined bottom, a second attempt at breaking, and a volatile grind back up, with some swings down - with a really nice volume shelf building around 33.59  


So, I like the chart enough to keep looking into it, and decide to check out out institutional holdings.  
[https://imgur.com/w1qIQ0J](https://imgur.com/w1qIQ0J)  
[https://imgur.com/DEVaiif](https://imgur.com/DEVaiif)   
This list is a little outdated as q1 nears an end, but we see in q4 a lot of tutes were adding more to their positions - and some pretty good names are on there: Vanguard, Blackrock, State street,  BAC,  even Shitadel.   


My thought process then tells me to keep looking for more, this is how I find my trades - in no particular order but all necessary: TA, Institutional holdings, twitter sentiment, google trends, order flow/dark pool prints, and studying the option chain.  


Google trends that standout to me:

5 year look  
[https://imgur.com/qFe6pSR](https://imgur.com/qFe6pSR)  
12 month look.  


The trends appear to give some pretty obvious confirmation - weather is getting nicer, people are sick of winter, they want out of the house - CWH sells outdoor gear, generators, kayaks, fishing equipment, rents RVs etc. etc. all - the perfect kind of niche for the season we're entering (don't forget stimulus checks - and while you guys might be yoloing your stim on options for tendies, there are plenty of boring assholes that are spending that money on grills, rvs, kayaks, etc. all)

here's some twitter sentiment, i was actually surprised at how well CWH seems to engage their user base.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, like it or not. This is a trade I think will have legs.  
It has a fairly decent chart set up, it has strong institutional holdings, it has strengthening google trends, strong twitter engagement and it has a cheap cost of entry.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be entering **6/18 $40 strikes** monday morning. My stop loss on this trade will be somewhere around 31.40 to 31.50. The greeks on that contract are big in favor of the buyer with a .436 delta to -.027 Theta. So you've got plenty of time to let it ride

The contract itself isn't as liquid as i'd like but does have 2500+ OI, just very light volume.  I'll likely try to stagger my buys throughout the day with different limits at the bid and the mid, but not the ask.

NOW for the past 2 years the general media/investing community has been very harsh towards Warren Buffetts investment style, while he sits on 140 billion of cash.

Both these firms remained relatively stagnant after the crash last March. While other banks also sit on more capital than anytime before. 

Why? Why do these firms have so much cash?

Especially when the market helps protect that cash from inflation based devaluation.

Part of it describes how you guys (and gals) made money from trading GME. Before the manuscript is finalized I wanted to make sure my description was 100% accurate:

Billion-dollar hedge funds like Melvin Capital unknowingly exposed themselves to a Tail Risk when they “shorted” GameStop stock in January 2021. Shorting, aka short selling, is a financial contract where stock is borrowed and then immediately sold with a promise to buy it back at a future date. If the price is lower in the future, the investor keeps the difference (makes money). If the price is higher, the investor pays the difference (loses money).

Investors from an online community called Wall Street Bets aggressively bought the stock, driving its price up from $25 per share to a peak of $350 per share. By the end of January, Melvin Capital and other hedge funds had to buy back the stock at the unexpected higher price. Melvin Capital lost about $4 billion, roughly one-third of their total assets. An estimated $70 billion was transferred between investors from the event. If Robinhood (stock trading app) didn’t restrict trading, multiple hedge funds would have gone bankrupt in a single day.

Many of the r/wallstreetbets traders used an app called Robinhood to buy GameStop stock. In the last days of January 2021, the app prevented traders from buying more GameStop stock before hedge funds like Melvin Capital closed their positions (bought back the stock). The decision was controversial. Robinhood’s CEO, Vlad Tenev, stated he halted trading of GameStop stock because his company didn’t have the collateral to cover the massive payouts. Others saw it as market manipulation. If Robinhood hadn’t have halted trading, hedge funds like Melvin Capital could have gone bankrupt in a single day.",I'm writing a book and r/wallstreetbets is in it!

87,mer3er,"**First, a summary:**

PFSI is significantly undervalued when comparing to competitors. Their financials show that their stock will *literally be free money* (after \~1 year).

***Just a note: UWMC and RKT still have good potential for short term speculative plays since their short interests are high. This post is only talking about mid to long term valuations among large traditional mortgage companies.***

**Introduction:**

With the recent feud between RKT and UWMC, I decided to take a closer look at a few other companies in the mortgage sector. I was surprised to find that PFSI was at such a low valuation compared to competitors. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI) is a company that does mortgage origination and investment management services. They were founded in 2008 at the heels of the mortgage financial crisis and they are based in Westlake Village, CA. Currently, they are the 3rd largest mortgage lender. They operate in both the direct-to-consumer channel and the broker channel. 

**Financials:**

PFSI has a market cap of $4.73B on sales of $4.56B, and a net income of $1.65B in 2020. They also have $3.4B of equity at the end of 2020 (see their [10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001745916/ef9f38e8-9bdd-48a2-9a09-3cc22e4832ac.pdf)). This means that if they make $1.3B profit in 2021, it's P/B will go below 1 for the current stock price. $1.3B is a 21% downside to their 2021 earning numbers, and I think it will be pretty likely they make this much since the housing market is still hot. The consensus EPS forecast for 2021 is $19/share, and with 71.77m shares outstanding, that would already be $1.36B earnings. Usually for sectors like mortgage, the outlook and forecast are pretty conservative as well.

**Stock buyback:**

PFSI recently approved an increase of their buyback program from $500m to $1B, $350m of which is already used before end of 2020. This means that they are going to buy back another \~15% of the company at current valuations.

Here I've only compared a few larger cap traditional mortgage companies. I excluded companies like RKT, LDi, TREE, etc because they have different business models with online lending and their valuations cannot be compared with these traditional mortgage companies.

**Risks of housing market downturn:**

The major headwind to mortgage companies right now is the prospect of rising interest rates and a housing market downturn. However, we know that JPow said the Fed interest won't move until at least after 2023. The mortgage interest rate may creep up a bit but won't go up wildly for next few years. This means that the risk to mortgage companies is not substantial. The lower EPS is already included in the forecast. Furthermore, these few biggest mortgage companies are still gaining market share from the big banks in the mortgage sector, and I would expect this to offset the loss in overall business somewhat.

Positions: bought 150 PFSI shares to start. I'm also holding RKT shares and leaps for its growth potential and squeeze potential (see my past DDs on RKT: [RKT's Road to S&amp;P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/), [why RKT is not a mortgage company with an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/), [Catalyst for continued housing boom this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8tg5w/rkt_catalysts_for_continued_housing_boom_this_year/), [RKT's growth story shows up in its financials](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/))","Move over UWMC, PFSI is the most undervalued large mortgage company",1.0,1616893203,CMScientist
