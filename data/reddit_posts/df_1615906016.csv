Don’t worry we are coming back for you.

The reason why the rest of us aren’t panicking is we really like the stock. 

If you believe in your investment why are you selling? 

We can all win together! More importantly, profits are made on dips, not uptrends.

14,m6arv2,"Option addicts listen up. GME calls are too pricey, stick to buying shares! I think I found a way to make money off GME without selling my GME shares, obviously to buy more GME. I’ve been doing some research before my stimmy hits and hear me out. I think the shorts hedged with the “exx are teee ETF from the start OR are starting to do so, the charts are almost identical. After going down this rabbit hole this is what I’m doing, for every 4 GME shares i buy Im buying 1 exx are teee call. (exxx are teee calls are cheaper than GME calls) (exx are teee ticker is banned that’s why I’m being retarted) After taking profits from the XRT call, I’m buying more GME or doing the 4 to 1 ration again. Do NOT yolo on XRT calls,that is betting against yourself! It has to be at the least a 4 to 1 ratio for it to work as an infinite money glitch. If the shorts can hedge with “exx are tee”to minimize their losses then retail can use “exx are tee” to maximize their profits OKAY! How do you like that Cramer? LMAO. My rabbit hole lead me to uncover that GME is the main holding in the exxx are teee ETF, the charts are almost identical. Led me to believe that as the shorts lose on GME, they minimize loses by profiting on exxx are tee. Do NOT yolo on exxx are teee calls, that is betting against yourself, do that 4 to 1 ratio OR just strictly buy GME shares. 

This is not financial advice I’m just a young girl from Bulgaria. JK apes, I just like the stock and think Roaring Kitty and daddy Cohen are sexyAF! 

TDLR: HODL your GME shares like lottery tickets. For every 4 GME shares you buy, buy 1 exxx are teee call, then rinse and repeat. Do NOT yolo on exx are tee calls, that is betting against yourself.

We are now in the endgame. This may be the last chance to jump into a cozy first-class seat on the GME rocket. The prices are low right now, to scare away the paperhanded and allowing YOU to put your stimmy-check to good use. Think of all those adopted Gorillas and Wild-Animals, rooting for their new parents.

I had an epiphany while watching my favourite TV-Show „Chuck“. The store they work in is named „Buy More“ and in one specific episode, the store shall be closed. But the employees are HOLDING THE LINE. Together strong they declare - this is now Buymoria. Thats where we are right now. We are in Buymoria.

I’m only 15 shares in at appr. 168$, but guess what: I’m convinced i’ll drive a lambo at the end of april.

I've been studying the chart for a long time regarding to the current prices and data available, as I noticed that this drop is good so far to sustain the supply and demand in any trend, in GME situation it's an uptrend ofc, but to sustain the trend some pullbacks to reaccumulate and gaining more buying power before the next surge.

&amp;#x200B;

The yellow Bold box is Feb range, did you see how the price touched the high then fall back? this fall back I believe will find a support at white little box \~150$ / 100$ at that range

Also to added trend line to determine the next possible wave range, I think it would be at  1400 / 3500$ if somehow the price broke that level then the short squeeze has to be happen later on, it would be almost impossible for short sellers to stop the surge, unless if SEC intervene.. well I'm not expert in the American rules, but everything is possible in GME situation.

Lastly, this pullback isn't done yet, I expect the price will keep falling until it find a decent support.
