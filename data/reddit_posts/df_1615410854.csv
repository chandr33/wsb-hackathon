I was thinking about it today with the extreme volatility today and what it may mean for the growth of GME in the near future.  People keep talking about GME hitting 100k as well as retiring in their 20's, 30's, etc and the more I think about it the more I believe it might be possible.

TLDR: Remember apes, even though GME is now on SSR they can short the stock on an uptick! Stay strong, ignore the fuckery and hold the line! 

——

Usually the hedgies can short a stock at any time they want. Today they had a small, short lived victory and GME dropped more than 10% (how’d that work out for ya Melvin?) which means it has been placed on SSR (Short Sale Restriction) 

This means that if the price is already going down, they are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, they are allowed to continue their shenanigans.

My thoughts on this is that lunchtime today was a test.

If they’re sat on the shorts that have gone from iBorrowDesk, then tomorrow they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left. 

Now if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell, driving the price lower and hitting stop losses continuing the drop.

If I was a Melvin, and I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up until I ran out of ammo. I would probably even let it spike to scare people into thinking that the top has been hit.

This could be an especially effective tactic for them if people don’t realise that SSR does not stop them from shorting completely!

Ape may be retarded, but ape not dumb. Ignore the bullshit that is bound to unfold over the next 24/48 hours. If you have read the DD and been following this for a while, you know just how fucked they are. 

Hold strong brothers and sisters, moon awaits!

---

&amp;nbsp;

It seemed like today's attack on GME was a blatant attempt to activate all sell limit orders to be able to acquire shares. That's the only logical explanation I can see based on the way the price was attacked. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some folks might have put in limit sells at 200 (or lower) to avoid being a ""bagholder"" and these limit sells would be exploited in this situation.

&amp;nbsp;

When the share price got massively depressed, opportunistic market manipulators might have taken the opportunity to buy back both shares previously shorted and shares used in the attack.
