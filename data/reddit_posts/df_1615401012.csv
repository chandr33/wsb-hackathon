36,m24rz6,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have made billions of dollars from their bearish bets on Tesla and big tech stocks in the recent knee-jerk selloff triggered by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday. Tesla was short-sellers’ biggest win, giving them estimated profits of $4.2 billion so far in 2021, followed by more than $1 billion gains each on Zoom Video and Apple, according to Ortex. 

**They were however burnt by betting against videogame maker Gamestop. The company, which was at the heart of the so-called “stonks” retail trading mania, has jumped another 400% in the past two weeks as amateur investors have jumped back in. GameStop’s e-commerce strategy plans were seen driving this week’s renewed gains in January’s “meme” stocks, alongside speculation that small investors will use their upcoming stimulus checks to trade.**

In other major bets, investors made about $1 billion from shorting QQQ, an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy benchmark hit correction territory on Monday, slipping more than 10% from record highs",Gamestop.,1.0,1615401118,Flower2727

I would like to ask for your forgiveness.  At approximately 12:20 today I went to take a piss.  When I returned to my computer I had lost oodles of money on GME.

I panicked.  I had a moment of weakness.  I used my sanity little paper hands, and sold at $191.

I'm not proud of the atrocities that I've committed, and I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.  

To being to repent for my sins I decided to suffer for my sins and buy back in at $262.  

I'm not worth of your forgiveness, but it was almost as if I was possessed by the Devil himself.

I am willing to ride on the outside of the rocket ship to the moon, because I fear I am no longer worth to ride inside.
