11,mh5kfx,"Blink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.

      The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is  the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of  growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.üíéüôå

Below I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. üíéüôå

Also I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? 

Here is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.

Big move coming will we see fireworks today or tomorrow or both...We have a shortened trading week. Friday will close at noon. Factors in how this week will play out, the end of the quarter and the new month coming and oh let's not forgot president Biden to unveil his economic plan today. I was looking to get some type of pull back so we could have and excuse to bounce on the 1st¬†of the month so far, the pullback has been very minimal. The end of the week is lining up to be and explosive trend day up but today seems to be a blah day waiting on news. Boundaries have been set on both sides so let's see what breaks first. Today's possible outcomes are as follows: 1) Range day structure with consolidation between 395 and 393 area before breaking higher or lower. 2) Break above 395 area for a lopsided range day which opens a path to 400. 3) we hold 395 resistance area and break thru the 393-support area with a retest target of 390. 

1) Range day structure with consolidation between 395 and 393 area before breaking higher or lower. **40% probability**

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.

   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.

* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

- day trading it( he might talk about the volatiliy and the fact that we should take good profits from it dayli, rather then just stand with it there).

Shure, their game is still not in the playstation store and updates are following slower than planed. Nevertheless, I suspect their sales were still decent, a lot of people bought the game and they even reached break even of their costs really fast. So why is the stock price still tanking massive losses. So I studied the chart, metrics and dug.....[surprisingly](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/melvin-capital-hedge-fund-made-25m-off-video-game-cyberpunk-2077-flopped-debut-20201217)  an old friend is involved. This made me wonder. I checked the [short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/otgly) (maybe 56%, but we know that this figure could be higher) and [short interest history](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/OTCMKTS/OTGLY/short-interest/)(shorts have been increase recently by 40,000 shares!). Looking at the chart this clearly looks a lot like the moves we have seen in Gamestop after the first squeeze a high selling pressure due to large short selling orders.

[CD Project Red share price \(in z≈Ç\)](https://preview.redd.it/xarbm3nr0dq61.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edacef4abad69af1d5a405e83df02a47143796ea)

Having this in mind I am pretty bullish on CD Project Red in that they are in general a pretty decent game developing studio and definitely learned their lesson going forward. I expect that their game will be in the playstation store by end of may or end of june. Many of my friends still did not bought a ps5 due to the lack of new games and the delivery issues which still continue up to this date. Hence the Sony situation should not have affected their sales too much (as their core fan base is based on pc gamers either way). Their sales margin was 33% in 2019!! Their debt is almost non existent due to their strong balance sheet from their past Witcher games, it slightly increased probably due to recent developing costs. 

Note that the stock price will be further driven down by hedge funds in the short term if no positive media appears.

&amp;#x200B;

Position: I own 14 shares of CD Project Red as a long term play.

It's a tactic of warfare for the enemy to seclude you and make you feel alone, but the reality of it is there's far more than you already think there is waiting to back you up, and are fighting with you behind the obvious lines.   In fact I believe that there are far more commando apes than the ones making noise.

Eating polenta is like buying a LEAP on your health. Did y'all know corn is like one of the cheapest foods they can produce? That's means low operating costs and more YoY revenue gain especially if you factor in some GMO. Naysayer keeps talking about how GMO crops are getting phased out, but listen: the organic movement is overvalued to hell and back and due for a correction. When the bubble pops, money in the sector will shift back to GMO crops and corn will take you to the moon while speculators will be holding the recycled bags. I mean have you seen Interstellar? They go so beyond the moon they're like in another fucking dimension. And what crops are featured in the film? I rest my case.

Not only are the fundamentals solid, technicals are showing an entry point of value too. Breakfast time is coming up in like an hour and the RSI (relative starvation index) is below 30 now. Candlesticks show a diagonal uptrend for support. Also oatmeal is going down. We all know when oatmeal goes down, alternative grain porridges go up. It's makes perfect sense because what does everyone eat for breakfast during a pandemic? Oatmeal. Ain't no one got time for bacon and eggs when they've just woken up 5 minutes before their first morning zoom meeting. Now that vaccines are rolling out, everyone  is feeling more adventurous and it's clear polenta will get a cut of the market share here. This is a sector + long term + recovery play and we can capitalize on this move.

***TL;DR-  Citadel and friends have shorted the treasury bond market to oblivion  using the repo market. Citadel owns a company called Palafox Trading and  uses them to EXCLUSIVELY short &amp; trade treasury securities. Palafox  manages one fund for Citadel - the Citadel Global Fixed Income Master  Fund LTD. Total assets over $123 BILLION and 80% are owned by offshore  investors in the Cayman Islands. Their reverse repo agreements are  ENTIRELY rehypothecated and they CANNOT pay off their own repo  agreements until someone pays them, first. The ENTIRE global financial  economy is modeled after a fractional reserve system that is beginning  to experience THE MOTHER OF ALL MARGIN CALLS.***

***THIS is why the DTC and FICC are requiring an increase in SLR deposits. The madness has officially come full circle.***

My fellow apes,

After writing [Citadel Has No Clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I couldn't shake one MAJOR issue: *why  do they have a balance sheet full of financial derivatives instead of  physical shares? Even Melvin keeps their derivative exposure to roughly  20%...(*[*whalewisdom.com*](https://whalewisdom.com/)*, Melvin Capital 13F - 2020)*

The  concept of a hedging instrument is to protect against price  fluctuations. Hopefully you get it right and make a good prediction, but  to have a portfolio with literally 80% derivatives.... absolute  INSANITY.. it's is the complete OPPOSITE of what should happen.. so WHAT  is going on?

Let's break this into 4 parts:

1. ***Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements***
2. ***Treasury Bonds***
3. ***Palafox Trading***
4. ***Short-seller Endgame***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, 4 easy steps... as simple as possible.

***Step 1: Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements.***

*WTF are they?*

A  Repurchase Agreement is much like a loan. If you have a big juicy  banana worth $1,000,000 and need some quick cash, a repo agreement might  be right for you. Just take that banana to a pawn shop and pawn it for a  few days, borrow some cash, and buy your banana back later (plus a few  tendies in interest). This creates a liability for you because you have  to buy it back, unless you want to default and lose your big, beautiful  banana. Regardless, you either buy it back or lose it. A reverse repo is  how the *pawn shop* would account for this transaction.

*Why do they matter?*

Repos and reverse repos are the *LIFEBLOOD*  of global financial liquidity. They allow for SUPER FAST conversions  from securities to cash. The repo agreement I just described is  happening daily with hedge funds and commercial banks. In fact, the  submitted amount for repo agreements today (3/29) was [$40.354 BILLION.](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000)  This amount represents the ONE DAY REPO due on 3/30. So yeah, SUPER  short term loans- usually a few days. It's probably not a surprise that  back in 2008 the go-to choice of collateral for repo agreements was  mortgage backed securities..

[Lehman Brothers](https://www.cpajournal.com/2016/08/01/lehman-brothers-mf-globals-misuse-repurchase-agreements-reformed-accounting-standards/)  went bankrupt because they fraudulently classified repo agreements as  sales. You can do your own research on this, but I'll give you the quick  n' dirty:

Lehman would go to a  bank and ask for cash. The bank would ask for collateral in return and  Lehman would offer mortgage backed securities (MBS). *It's great having so many mortgages on your balance sheet, but WTF good does it do if you have to wait 30 YEARS for the cash*.... So Lehman gave their collateral to the bank and recorded these loans as *sales* instead of payables, with no intention of buying them back. This *EXTREMELY*  overstated their revenue. When the market started realizing how sh\*tty  these ""AAA"" securities actually were (thanks to Michael BRRRRRRRRy &amp;  friends), they were no longer accepted as collateral for repo loans. We  all know what happened next.

The interest rate in 2008 on repos started climbing as the cost of borrowing money went through the roof. This happens because **the collateral is no longer attractive compared to cash.**  My favorite bedtime story is how the Fed stepped in and bought all of  the mean, toxic assets to save the US economy.. They literally paid  Fannie &amp; Freddie over [$190 billion in bailouts..](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/initiatives/1-housing-and-economic-recovery-act-of-2008)

https://preview.redd.it/xe48hekabdq61.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=379f70b6eddd09e4a31b679e393a88f78f26d7ab

A few years later, [MF Global](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42091.pdf)  would suffer the same fate when their European repo exposure triggered a  massive margin call. Their foreign exposure to repo agreements was  nearly **4.5x** their total  equity.. Both Lehman and MF Global found themselves in a major  liquidity conundrum and were forced into bankruptcy. Not to mention the  other losses that were incurred by other financial institutions... check  this list for [bailout totals](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/programs).

But.... did you know this happened AGAIN in 2019?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4cdwooqbbdq61.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03ab672c58956c4a496963571420b5240038ba63

Instead of the gradual increase in rates, the damn thing spiked to **10% OVERNIGHT**.  This little blip almost ruined the whole show. It's a HUGE red flag  because it shows how the system MUST remain in tight control: one slip  and it's game over.

The reason for the spike was once again due to a lack of liquidity. The [federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20repo%20market%2C%20there,supply%20mismatch%20in%20the%20market)  stated there were two main catalysts (click the link): both of which  removed the necessary funds that would have fueled the repo market the  following day. Basically, their checking account was empty and their  utility bill bounced.

It became apparent that ANOTHER infusion of cash was necessary to prevent the whole damn system from collapsing. *The reason being: institutions did NOT have enough excess liquidity on hand*. Financial institutions needed a fast replacement for the MBS, and J-POW had just the right thing.. $FED go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

&amp;#x200B;

***Step 2: Treasury Bonds***

Ever heard of the bond market? Well it's the redheaded step-brother of the STONK market.

The  US government sells you a treasury bond for $1,000 and promises to pay  you interest depending on how long you hold it. Might be 1%, might be  3%; might be 3 months, might be 10 years. Regardless, the point is that  purchasing the US Treasury bond, in conjunction with mortgage backed  securities, allowed the fed to keep pumping unlimited liquid tendies  into the repo market. Surely, liquidity won't be an issue anymore,  right?

Now... take the repo  scenario from the Lehman Brothers story, but instead of using ONLY  mortgage backed securities, add in the US Treasury bond: primarily the  10-year. Note that MBS are still prevalent at 19.1% of all repo  transactions, but the US Treasury bond now represents a whopping 67%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/luuc4gvfbdq61.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd076f9953b93f399fb3fb6a4838b32685a8b5c2

For now, just know that the US Treasury has replaced the MBS as the dominant source of liquidity in the repo market.

***Step 3: Palafox Trading***

Ever heard of Palafox Trading? Me either. It's pretty much meant to be that way.

Palafox  Trading is a market maker for repurchase agreements. Initially, they  appear to be an innocent trading company, but their financial statements  revealed a little secret:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r5u2squgbdq61.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7801a6f38ee69dd785dd6b00337a43f428710089

Are you KIDDING ME?... I should have known...

OF COURSE Citadel has their own private repo market..

Who else is in this cesspool?!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygabqwphbdq61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d2503b72664474b73888c26a025b27e27f361e

I made this using the financial statement listed above, showing all beneficiaries of the GFIL

Everything rolls into the [Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund](https://aum13f.com/firm/citadel-advisors-llc?view_all=fund)... This controls **$123,218,147,399**  (THAT'S BILLION) in assets under management... I know offshore accounts  are technically legal for hedge funds.... but when you look at the  itemized holdings of these funds on Citadel's most recent [form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/148826/PDF/148826.pdf), it gives me chills..

[Form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/148826/PDF/148826.pdf) page 105-106....

&amp;#x200B;

Ok... ok.... let me get this straight....

1. The repo market provides IMMEDIATE liquidity to hedge funds and other financial institutions
2. After the MBS collapse in 2008, the US Treasury replaced it as the liquid asset of choice
3. Citadel owns 100% of Palafox Trading which is a market maker for repo agreements
4. This market maker provides liquidity to the Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD (GFIL) through Citadel Advisors
5. 80% of its $123,218,147,399 in assets under management belong to entities in the Cayman Islands

Ok.....I tore the [bermuda, paradise, and panama papers](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=citadel&amp;e=&amp;commit=Search)  apart and found that all of these funds boil down to just a few  managers, but can't pin anything on them for money laundering...  However, if there EVER were a case for it, I'd be extremely suspicious  of this one...

The level of shade  on all this is INCREDIBLE... There should be NO ROOM for a investment  pool as big as Citadel to hide this sh\*t.... absolutely ridiculous..

The  fact that there is so much foreign influence over our bond &amp; repo  market, which controls the liquidity of our country, is VERY  concerning..

***Step 4: Short-seller Endgame***

Alright, I know this is a lot to take in..

I've  been writing this post for a week, so reading it all at one time is  probably going to make your head explode.. But now we can finally start  putting all of this together.

Ok, remember how I explained that the repo rate started to rise in '08 because **the collateral was no longer attractive compared to cash? That means there wasn't enough liquidity in the system.**  Well this time the OPPOSITE effect is happening. Ever since March 2020,  the short-term lending rate (repo rate) has nearly dropped to ***0.0%....***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u6b4vc9lbdq61.png?width=330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b776d769311d0fc9576b46038d7b46e4177101a7

https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-repo-reference-rates

So  the fed is printing free money, the repo market is lending free money,  and there's basically NO difference between the collateral that's being  lent and the cash that's being received.. With all this free money going  around, it's no wonder why the price of the 10 year treasury has been  declining.

In fact, hedge funds are SO confident that the 10 year treasury will continue to decline, that they've **SHORTED THE 10-YEAR BOND MARKET.** I'm not talking about speculative shorting, I mean shorting it to oblivion like they've shorted stocks.

Don't believe me?

Hedge  funds like Citadel Advisors must first locate the treasury bond in  order to swap them for cash in the repo market. It's extremely difficult  to do this with the fed because they're tied up in government BS, so  they locate a lender in the market. Now who would Citadel know that's an  asset manager?

Perhaps the SAME asset manager that they borrow shares from - [BlackRock](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7o7iy/blackrock_bagholders_inc/). It's now obvious why BlackRock was tapped by the US Government to [purchase their treasuries](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-taps-blackrock-to-purchase-bonds-for-the-government-11585085843).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ysbxe79mbdq61.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf6530d1d19bfac29e33b88825969a1805912261

So  BlackRock purchases a sh\*t load of treasuries and keeps them on reserve  for hedgies like Citadel to short. Citadel comes along and asks for the  bond, they throw it into Palafox Trading and collect their cash. So  what happens when they need to pay for their repo agreement? Surely to  GOD there are enough bonds floating around, right? **Not unless hedge funds like Citadel have shorted more bonds than there are available.**

Here's the evidence.

There  have been 3 instances over the past year where the repo rate dipped  below the ""failure"" rate of -3.0%. On March 4th 2021, the repo rate hit [\-4.25%](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-bonds-repo/explainer-u-s-treasury-sell-off-spills-over-to-repo-market-idUSL2N2L32FR) which means that investors were willing to PAY someone **4.25%** interest to lend THEIR OWN MONEY in exchange for a 10 year treasury bond.

This  is a major signal of a squeeze in the treasury market. It's MAJOR  desperation to find bonds. With the federal reserve purchasing them  monthly from the open market, it leaves room for a shortage when the  repo call hits. If an entity like BlackRock hasn't purchased more  treasuries since lending them out, hedge funds like Citadel simply  cannot cover unless they go into the market and PAY the bond holder for  their bond. It's literally the same story as all of the heavily shorted  stocks.

Still not convinced?

At the end of 2020, Palafox Trading listed **$31,257,102,000 (BILLION)** in GROSS repo agreements. **$30,576,918,000** (BILLION) were directly related to repurchasing treasury bonds....

I  know the totals are slightly different than the balance above, but  they're both from 2020. It's just how they are presented. Check for  yourself. (https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170)

So  no, they don't have it covered. Why? Because our POS financial system  allows for rehypothecation, that's why. It's a big fancy word for using  amounts owed to you as collateral for another transaction. In the event  that the party defaults, **SO DO YOU**.

This  means that the securities which Palafox is waiting to receive, have  ALREADY been pledged to pay off the bonds they currently OWE to someone  else.

Does this sound familiar?  Promising to repay something with something you don't already have?  Basically you need to wait on Ted, to repay Steve, to repay Jan, to  repay Mark, to repay you, so you can repay Fred, so Fred can.... Yeah,  REAAAAL secure..

OH, and by the way, the problem is getting WORSE.

Here's Palafox's financial statements in **2018:**

All  of this made me wonder what the FICC's balance is for treasury  deposits... For those of you that don't know, the FICC is a branch of  the DTCC that deals with government securities.

Just  like the updated DTC rule for supplemental liquidity deposits being  calculated throughout the day, the FICC also calculates this amount as  it relates to treasury securities multiple times throughout the day.

Would you be surprised that the FICC has $47,000,000,000 (BILLION) just in DEPOSITS for unsettled treasury bonds? **$47,000,000,000!?!?!?**

**CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ASTRONOMICAL THE ACTUAL MARGIN MUST BE?!**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/okj7tjorbdq61.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0050b8800076c157d699e2dd1cfe8ad97015ef15

There  is TOO much evidence, from TOO many separate events, pointing to the  imminent default of something big. That's all this is going to take.  When Ted can't repay Steve, it means the panic has already started. Just  look at how easy it was for the repo rate to spike overnight in 2019..

We  are already starting to see the consequences of the SLR update with  Archegos, Nomura, and Credit Suisse. This is just a taste of what's to  come.. and now we know the bond market represents an even BIGGER  catalyst in triggering this event.. and it's happening already.

With  that being said, things finally started to make sense... Citadel  doesn't NEED shares if their investment strategy to go short on  EVERYTHING instead of going long. Why bother owning shares? BlackRock  and other asset managers simply lend them to you when you need to pony  up a margin call for stocks and bonds..

Their  HFT systems allow them to manipulate the market in their favor so  there's NO way they could fail.... unless.... a bunch of degenerates all  decided to ignore taking profits...

But that would NEVER happen, right?

...wrong...
