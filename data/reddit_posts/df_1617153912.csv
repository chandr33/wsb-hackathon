13,mgv7s9,"Fellas, gather round my Fubo Subcription as I tell you why you are basically being handed free cash at these prices if you buy FUBO. From it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22 it has been a wild ride. Fubo is an incredible streaming service especially when it comes to sports. As a user and subscriber myself what they offer for $65 a month well worth it in addition to the $18 sports package. That to me is personally enough to ever need at a much cheaper price that cable. I'm just some stoner in my 20's what more would I need? Now imagine a shit ton of us starting to cut cable and move towards these streaming services? 

There is a growing market of ""cord cutters"" that is going to be in the millions. If Fubo can grow their marketing and grab a large chunk that will help its revenue grow substantially. Revenue that just topped 100m for it's first quarter ever. It should be noted that FUBO reacted positively to earnings and then the tech fuckery began. 

With their acquisition of Vigtory, a sports betting company, their goal to achieve a single platform tv screen and betting screen is extremely tangible. Imagine the amount of guys in their 20s and 30s who'd sign up for this shit. Not only would they be added subscribers but they could go from a $65 a month subscriber to a few hundred or a few thousand. This is hopefully going to be implemented in the fall or early winter. 

With the recent rotation out of growth stocks, FUBO will rip back, as many of these stocks have fallen 50-60%, people will quickly rotate into them again. I don't see it being a slow bleed for much longer. With these sharp drops due to the selloff, it's looking attractive with a decent short float of 35%. This could very easily trigger a decent sized squeeze. 

Institutions love FUBO as well. It's riding at 63% institutional ownership at this point despite the beatdown. You would see them have exited their positions by now if this doesn't bounce back hard. 

$80+ EOY book it.

No, this isn't financial advice, I just love the fucking stock and think this it's just criminally undervalued at the current share price.

16,mgv8u7,"Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. I’m might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and I’m like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others.

Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air.

Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. That’s what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. 

AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. 

AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I don’t know expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I don’t think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wife’s boyfriend.

I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle.

I like movies and I like the stock!

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, DELTA AIR LINES, INC. made $17.0 Billion revenue.
* They spend more than $-29 Billion with a loss of $-12 Billion.
* Investors lost $-19.5 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $20.4 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 17.7% a year for the next 5 years. That means DELTA AIR LINES, INC. will be worth $65.1, which represents **37.5%** upside from current price.

I am in the process of composing a diverse, defensive portfolio in which I can safely invest my money for the long term (25-35 yrs). I plan on setting up a monthly autoinvest and just forget about it.

I would like to hear your thoughts on my findings so far:

•**SPXP** \- Invesco S&amp;P 500 GBX (Accumulating)

•**EIMI** \- iShares Core MSCI EM IMI (0% Yield)

•**FXC** \- iShares China Large Cap (Distributing)

•**CNDX** \- iShares NASDAQ 100 (Accumulating)

•**TRET** \- VanEck Vector Global Real Estate (Distributing)

•And finally I am looking for a good UCITS alternative for **VGK -  Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ETF**. Can someone recommend me an ETF like this? Preferably Accumulating.

Note: I cannot buy US domiciled ETFs.

I prefer **accumulating** ETFs, but I couldn't find any for the Chinese markets and global real estate. If you know better ones, please share them with me!

I think it's a complete and diverse portfolio with some focus on chinese and emerging markets. I'm okay with the added risk from these markets as I'm still quite young (26).

That said, I don't really have any experience in ETF investing so any input would be highly appreciated!

Note: I am going to invest a portion of my wealth in my country's government bonds as they are tax-free so this is why I didn't include any bond ETF in this portfolio.

So what do you guys think? Is it missing anything? (commodities maybe?) Is it too heavy on something? I have yet to figure out the weighting of each ETF.

Is this a viable approach or am I sorely mistaken?

I was reviewing the options chain for April 1st, and how much open interest there is:

It looks like there are far more calls in the money or near the money. It looks like there are some major pain points on both sides depending on where it ends up Thursday:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9wu99jv3v9q61...*

As you can see, it looks like $169 is the break even where there is the same amount of open interest. At the $220 mark we see a pretty massive shift, and at $250 puts are almost completely wiped out. If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.

It also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.
