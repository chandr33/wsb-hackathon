0,m24hd5,"I get it. You sense this massive, homegrown, organic stonk movement, and you want to be a part of it. So you buy in on GME to get the tendies. But your entire plan is predicated on the idea that you can somehow coordinate a bunch of idiots to HODL the stock. What on earth makes you think that you could possibly take on large hedge funds with billions of dollars at their disposal? Melvin and the like don't need to go on WSB and give their DD; they have the money to manipulate the market in whatever way they see fit. They make their own pump &amp; dumps, or short &amp; distorts. They don't need to crowd source that shit. You're basically a bunch of cat wranglers. Do you really think you're going to be able to herd a bunch of apes into a coordinated effort? Most just want to get rich quick. And for those of you who don't, what is the exit plan, anyway? Just buy and hold forever? Do you really not ever desire to realize any gains? Then what is the point? I get it. Gamestop represents the pinnacle of nostalgia for our generation. Many of us spent hours in that store every week, clawing through games and talking about them with the staff. But to waste your savings in an attempt to relive those days is absolute insanity. Move on. Grow up. Buy into some established companies that will actually be around long enough to make you some money, and do it just a little bit at a time. I just really don't want to read about people jumping off bridges because SEC halted trading on meme stonks. I would rather you enjoy your life with some disposable cash. Anyway, that's just my $0.02, take it or leave it. Feel free to talk smack. I don't mind. FYI, as you may have already guessed, I do not currently own, and do not plan to own, any GME. Currently holding AMD, MRNA, PLTR, CRM, RYCEY, TBIO, &amp; SNDL (bought at the recent peak, like a true ape).",Cat Wranglers,1.0,1615400415,KansanInPortland

7,m24hi5,"So I’ve been watching the ticker nonstop for the past few weeks, much like all of you have. Since we started seeing major gains last week, I noticed massive buys at times in the range of 500k shares at a time. I can’t imagine that’s all retail. This kept happening as prices continued to increase. That brings us to 9:30 this morning when 2million shares were sold. Although this didn’t really cause a dip or stop the stock price from continuing to increase, we come to about an hour ago when over 3 million shares were sold in the matter of 20 minutes. 

I believe institutions are buying in and pumping the stock price in order to sell high and just make money off the people who fomo’d this week and bought in at $250+. Obviously some of these sales were shorts and not just shares they actually owned but I’m sure this helped them recover tons of cash that was lost due to our 💎✊. 

All of this is to say that the squeeze hasn’t happened, I still fully believe it’s still to come and I’ll be holding my shares til I die. We just might have to hold longer because the losses they’re recovering might push back the squeeze since they might not be as desperate to cover their shorts if they’re making money off of us in the meantime, unless something triggers it. 

TLDR: Market manipulation is happening, keep holding. Don’t be afraid of future dips that will definitely be coming like the one we experienced today.

Also I might not know what tf I’m talking about so someone educate me if I’m wrong please. Just a theory I’ve thought of to explain the madness that just happened.

9,m24hok,"So here's the deal, we just dropped from around $350 to as low as $178, but don't panic! It's okay! In fact it's good! I just bought some more shares at $225, and here's why. They clearly have been borrowing shares to short, but my guess is, and I don't know how it works exactly, but they've hoarded them for this moment. They sold an absolute shit ton of them during everybody's lunch hour, on the east coast anyways, and it worked to drive the price down. Last I checked though, the rocket fuel that we use is, say it with me, shorted shares! All this means is that we will fly even higher, because we have now shorts that they're going to need to cover before this is over. Rest easy knowing that they are helping us here. Anybody that sold, just go ahead and buy back in, we won't bite. Everybody that held, you now have a badge of honor.

Hedge funds’ balls start to feel the burn so they try what they can. They are pushing a lot of their shares at once therefore pushing the price down.

Retail retards are not selling therefore **NOTHING HAS CHANGED**! If we don’t get scared the price will be back super quickly.

# So what should you do?

Buy the freaking discounted shares. This is the best oportunity ever.

We can cry how bad they are or we can take their money. They are trying to fuck us but they are rather giving as free fucking money.

If we buy these shitton of super discouted shares what they are throwing to the market, we will be 10X better situation afterwards. **BUY THE DIP APES!**
