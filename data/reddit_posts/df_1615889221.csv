#  Financial Disclaimer

* This is definitely not financial advice, the associated volatility and risk is much more substantial than your average trade. Precede with caution! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Intro 

* My fellow apes, did you miss your ticket to the moon/ still holding your ticket to mars with GME? Well here is a brand new prospective outlook that I have put some thought into. This aint no ticket to mars thou, RIOT is a possible fucking ticket to Uranus (the furtherst we could possibly go).

&amp;#x200B;

* Over the past few weeks I have been critically reflecting and decided to pen down my thoughts on a prospective for a long term stock outlook for RIOT. And as the underlying asset value drops temporarily I see this as a great dip buy potential with major upside prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Current Economic Climate

* With Biden signing the 1.9 Trillion USD Covid relief into law, an estimated 17 million people  will receive $1400 USD as their discretionary income. With the meme-fication of the stock market, investment has gained traction among the younger generations of millennials and gen z. Reports predict that  most of COVID relief checks will contribute to rent and essentials, but a growing proportion of the population will use this ‘free discretionary income’ to put into the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

* Linking this to Riot, Raconteur research infographic has demonstrated that it is the newer generations that are most interested and most likely to get into alternative decentralized sources of asset diversification investments. With Riot’s earnings report releasing on March 31st that works in conjunction with all these events, the potential for a spike and parabolic move could be significant.

&amp;#x200B;

* In terms of a longer outlook on the asset that RIOT procures and sell, the influx of big institutional buyers and interests (MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ruffer Investment company, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan) has solidified alternative  assets as a ‘holdable-asset’ and a far better hedge for inflation relative to gold. Either for long-term capital growth, or an inflationary hedging asset (with a faster than expected rebound of the global economy, interest rate and inflationary increase is a major concern for institutional players).

&amp;#x200B;

* In particular, JPMorgan has recently issued a prospectus investment  debt instrument that introduces proxy stocks to this aforementioned trend,  where riot will constitute 15% of the portfolio and will continue to introduce more institution money into the picture, amplifying the returns of RIOT over the coming years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# RIOT an “unprofessional” Technical Analysis 

* So we know based on a statistical analysis over the past 2 years that RIOT has over a 90% correlation to the underlying asset it procures and sells. However RIOT has  3X relative volatility to its underlying asset it procures and sells. - To simply put -  say RIOT’s underlying assets increase by 5% in its market value, RIOT  which procures and sells this asset increases is expected to  increase by 15% -  which is 3 times relative more to its underlying asset. Why is this the case? Simply put RIOT has a much smaller mkt cap compared to its underlying asset driver therefore it takes less cash inflow to increase the share price and cause possible parabolic upside swings.

&amp;#x200B;

* With this in mind, I will now focus on a more technical side, examining RIOT’s price action behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Elliott Wave Analysis - “The Elliott Wave Principle posits that collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences. These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.” - Straight from Wikipedia

&amp;#x200B;

* Typically there are 5 Elliot waves before a slight correction. As illustrated in the diagram we have just entered wave 5! This means we can expect a bullish momentum in the market up to the possible price target of 230.48 which historically is the key -2.0 fib extension level.  But hey if you get them diamonds hands the sky's the limit and the upside potential is as high as ur diamonds hands can hold.

&amp;#x200B;

* Fibonacci Retracement - The Fib levels are key areas of support and resistance. The start of the 5th Elliot wave was propagated by a retracement of the 0.618 Key Fibonacci resistance level in confluence with large institutions ( i.e Tesla - Elon Musk) buying the main underlying asset that RIOT procures and sells. Papa Elon bless thy gains.

&amp;#x200B;

* The recent onboarding on large institutions including banks such as JP Morgan offering debt instruments which constitute 15% RIOT stock diversification for this new trend further allows boomers to diversify into such stocks, creating a long term demand and driving up prices of RIOT in a possible parabolic manner over the upcoming year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# RIOT, shit is getting serious, the setup

* It can't be  stressed enough, but just think of this RIOT play on a macro physiological level. We have the largest of the largest companies and institutions buying into a limited supply  of the asset RIOT procures and sells. We have boomers slowing turning over and buying into RIOT through Big Banks such as JP Morgan's novel debt instruments. We have retail investors - the diamond hands GME bag holders with a Hella of a strong APE mentality. And RIOT the fucking company which mines and sells this underlying asset at the forefront of all this potential upside gains. RIOT has nothing to lose from this trend, only positive prospects. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Think about this fucking insane unprecedented surge in the demand of RIOTS underlying asset which is limited in supply. Guess what happens next where this massive influx of demand meets this limited supply for an asset? A fucking possible insane parabolic move upwards. And RIOT the most prominent company for this trend has insane relative stock volatility. RIOT is possibly going to the moon guys are you hopping on that ride? LMK if my analysis is trash but I firmly believe we are standing at the crossroads of history which side are you taking?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Competitors and why RIOT is remains king

* So now you are asking yourself is MARA or RIOT the better stock correlation play to this underlying asset? Personally based on my due diligence I lean towards RIOT for the following reasons.  MARA has seen to have high compensation packages, 2 share dilutions in a span of several months - while they have the largest expansions their ongoing costs are astronomical, their increase in cost % was larger than their increase in rev%.

&amp;#x200B;

* MARA while having the potential to have the largest operation in my opinion is just too risky (this is in my uneducated financial opinion). 

&amp;#x200B;

* RIOT on the other hand,  has stronger fundamentals with strong leadership, the number of share dilutions is only one at a much smaller mkt cap indicating that they clearly value shareholder wealth perseverance more than MARA, as they do not relays heavily on equity financing at the expense of shareholders as much as MARA does.

&amp;#x200B;

* RIOT looks like the more sturdy Rocketship that would get you from earth to the moon and then fucking mars possibly. A year from now when we possibly see RIOT worth over $1000 per share then we can look back and remember our fallen GME, AMC, NOK and BB brothers and tell them hey we fucking made it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion, RIOT to the moon?

* Stay strong fellow apes and always remember “we can remain retarded longer than shorts (trend naysayers) can remain solvent”.  We like the stock plain and simple, RIOT to the fucking moon?

&amp;#x200B;

* Just a reminder, this is purely for entertainment purposes, this is very much so an unprofessional financial perspective and outlook on RIOT, do your own due diligence, never invest more money than you are willing/ able to lose for anything you see on this subreddit.

Was listening to a podcast and they were talking about a start up who are making edible crayons.

Supposedly one day the founder put a crayon in his mouth and decided it would be a good snack, and here we are.

They're a genuine company, the founders are an ex marine and a pastry chef. Their 'who we are section reads' '*in the Fall of 2017 I was working on a project for the El Capitan High School Color Guard using crayons to color a project. As I put a color in my mouth to grab other one the question of is there a edible crayon. Found my answer. Nope. So I reach out to an old co-worker...*' It's worth a read. 

Not sure if WSB will fund this or meme it, or be disgusted at the idea of eating crayons that aren't the authentic product (can't beat the taste of real pastel), but I release this to you to do as you please. I am sure the result will be entertaining no matter what!

17,m65va8,"AMC was first based on a short percentage which wasn't that bad really and I'm still not convinced it wasn't AMCX, which is American Movie Classics ( 90%+ shorted), which was mistaking thought of at the beginning of February as AMC Theatres, as an eligible short squeeze contender. 

Stats from a google search:

AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) Short Interest Data
Current Short Volume	7,930,000 shares
Previous Short Volume	8,020,000 shares
Change Vs. Previous Month:	-1.12%
Dollar Volume Sold Short	$565.65 million
Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover	0.0

DD-esque if you want to be a nerd:
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AMCX/short-interest/

None of that matters.  AMC is fine and won't be mooning anytime soon.  They are opening theaters in CA and have changed some major things.  All other stocks discussed and taughted on this site have been labeled as distractions to GME, except AMC.

I believe AMC is the first and greatest distraction to the GME short squeeze there could be.  I also think if the money in AMC would move to GME, we would see the squeeze squoze in a matter of hours and can move on to whatever else.  Like AMC.  

Disclaimer:  This is exactly how elite hedge fund mangers and market makers talk about stocks they want to move and deal with in their ""idea dinners"" in the Hampton's.

I have been holding GME stock for over 7 weeks. I’m now thinking to sell it all and reap some benefits. I have been actively trading for few years now. I came across few folks that live on a weekly paycheck who have bought GME stock in the hope to make some money. Some entered around 450 and lost big time. These folks didn’t have the money to pay for bills. It kind of impacted their lives. I know even in this second ride, some entered in the 300’s and are going to loose money. 

If you put your hard earned money and you live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to make ends or pay bills, please sell your stock and make some money.

So they start media campains, infiltrate WSB, manipulate the price ect.. As I understand this it is a Mindgame on both sides. Either they try to cut their losses and start to cover or they get us to loose faith in Fact that we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent. 

One idea I have not read here is: 

They play this cyclical to fatigue us. This means that they let the price rise to a certain point just to cut it of right as we think we made it. This way they profit off of FOMO buyers who get burned and sell on the way down and get people to lose faith. 

Is this just a side effect of all the other shenanigans or a tactic on it's own?",What I think they are doing with GME,1.0,1615891047,lezorn

A few years ago,its share price was more than 200$. That's 2.000 times its current price!!!

[share price](http://www.investing.com/equities/ensco-intl?utm_source=investing_app&amp;utm_medium=share_link&amp;utm_campaign=share_instrument)

Recently,it made agreements with its creditors to reduce and restructure its debt. It has enough cash to pass through the next years with no problems. 

Also,some of its debt has a maturity time of 24 years.

Its market Cap is just 20M $,while its net income was 900M in 2016.

Crude oil and gas prices are increasing gradually,which could mean Ensco Rowan could go back at 200$/share in a few months.

59,m669av,"So, from the past few months I have made 200k+ from the stock market. I used to be a gamer working in a low wage retail part time job. I'm still in university, majoring in Finance. One day I stumbled upon wsb because I was bored and read DD about GME. I was convinced that it was a pretty good play, so I bought it when it was at $20+. My first big gain came from buying GME when it was cheap then selling it at 350. After that, I swing traded a few other stocks with the newfound capital that I had and made even more money. 

Finally, I'm sitting on about 200k+ right now. Deep down I still feel empty for some reason although I know I should be contented with the money I have as a young person. I have not spent any of the money on stuff yet because the truth is there's really nothing that interests me. I also have no hobbies except the stock market and I have no friends. I also lost interest in gaming because it feels like a complete waste of time to play games and not make money. I also quitted my retail job ever since I made tons of money from stocks because the low wage felt pointless. I spend all day looking at the markets and doing research, as well as trying to cope whenever my stocks don't go up.

Nowadays I am struggling, trying to find something meaningful to do with my life. My stocks have mostly been moving very slowly now and I spend everyday waiting for something to happen in the market or for some big good news to come out for my stocks. I need to find a life outside of the stock market, but almost everything seems pointless because it doesnt make as much as money as stocks.

Firstly, I know T212 sucks and I should get a real broker like Fidelity blah blah blah I joined last year before this saga educated my smooth-ish brain cut me some slack.

My question is what is the actual likelihood that T212 will prevent selling when the MOASS arrives? I know they tried some fuckery with restricting buying in January. I actually contacted them about this and they basically said ""soz our intermediary makes decisions we just push buttons"" which is fair enough.

But in the reverse situation, do they have any real reasons to prevent me from choosing when to close my positions? I read on a post earlier that eToro have in their terms and conditions a short sentence about being able to close your open transactions at a price that they deem proportionate (section 29.3).  Surely T212 will be similar in their behavior during this event?

My theory is that they hopefully will not restrict the selling due to the clear case for lawsuits + it doesn't financially hinder them in any way. But at the same time if they are at the mercy of their intermediary who are themselves linked to those that are about to be liquidated then perhaps that will start a vicious chain down to me.

75,m66eka,"The five stages of grief are an ever present reality in life. A loved one passes away, or you suffer through a heart break, you will most likely go through all five stages:  


Denial  


Anger.  


Bargaining.  


Depression.  


Acceptance.  


Going through these stages is a healthy way to cope with loss or a painful event. Financial pain is one of the hardest pains to cope with and if you trade stocks options or are anyway involved in the securities’ industry, you have most likely felt this pain. The deep gut-wrenching pain of seeing all of your profits disappear and your screen have so much red on it, you forget what the color green even looks like. I want to share with you how I have dealt with each of these stages after I have taken a loss and how so many other professional traders have reacted.  


Firstly, taking a loss shouldn’t be a financially crippling event. You should be using smart risk and reward ratios when trading and **ALWAYS USING A STOP LOSS**. This is not a negotiable aspect of trading or investing. You can either lose a defined amount with a stop loss or hold that loss and watch your investment go to zero.  
Denial  


The first stage after taking a loss is denial. Thinking and saying to yourself “*It’s just a small loss. It’s certain to come right back up*.” Let me be the first and hopefully the only person to tell you this: it doesn’t have to come back up. That stock doesn’t have to do anything you think it should. It can go to the moon or straight to zero and there is not a thing you can do to stop it. If you are using a stop loss, you are going to know if you are right or wrong about the trade very quickly. If you’re not using a stop loss…then RIP to your account. Don’t be a bag holder and not take a small loss compared to a large one . Denial is hard to conquer and the hardest to adapt to. Just remember that a loss can happen, it will happen and most stock don’t recover. Take your small loss and move on.  
Anger  


After that loss comes anger and frustration. You’re mad at yourself for taking the trade. You’re mad at the company whose stock it is. Furthermore, you’re mad at your broker. You are just plain mad at everything. The best thing to do at this stage is to accept accountability for what happened. 99.99/100 errors are caused by the user when it comes to trading. Here is the thing, there is no reason to get upset over a trade, the next one is around the corner, and it could be a great winner. Take the loss as an opportunity to pump the brakes and cool off. Clear your head, come back laser focused.  
Bargaining  


No matter what God you pray to or who you beg there is nothing that is going to change the outcome of that trade. A loss is a loss. The best thing to do at this stage is formulating a plan for the next time you take a loss. This way you have a guide on how to react and how to feel about your trading. Bargain with yourself, reward yourself for making smart trades by sizing up your trades. Make sure that the plan is reasonable and actionable and be honest with yourself when you fail.  
Depression  


People make mistakes, especially in finance. Just look at the hedge funds that shorted GME.  


Those are “professionals” managing billions of dollars, and they lost a ton of money being dumb and shorting a sub $10 stock. Here is the thing, I’ll repeat it until I turn blue in the face: losses happen. Don’t beat yourself up. Move on. Live to trade another day. The most important thing to remember is to learn from what happened and let it burn a lesson in your mind. Success is made from failure. Fail small and fast.  
Acceptance  


This is the stage everyone should start with hen they take a loss. The best traders in the world have no emotion when it comes to taking a loss or making a profit. They recognize what it is and repeat what they know will work. Trading is meant to be boring. The moment it gets exciting you need to take a look at your risk.  


Be boring and repeat what works is the main point. Double down on what makes you money and cut off what makes you lose money. If you are losing every trade, stop trading and reevaluate your strategy. IF you are winning a bunch of trades, size up and bring home some cash.",How to deal with loss,1.0,1615892202,hiftikha
