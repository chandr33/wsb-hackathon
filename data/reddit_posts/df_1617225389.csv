3,mhg0nv,"I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them. So here you go.

Note: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.

WHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS

A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a ""call"") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That's a pretty good deal.

So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.

But what if the price doesn't go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.

But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let's look at some option vocabulary.

CALL OPTION VOCABULARY

Strike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.

Exercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can't afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.

Expiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19

Premium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.

ITM and OTM: ""In the Money,"" and ""Out of the Money."" ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you'd make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401&gt;400, but you haven't broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.

FDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot's delight (but with an F, because autmod won't let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. The guy who spent 90k on 1dte (1 ""day to expiration"") OTM GME calls? Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.

WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

You have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let's break it down.

GME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.

Now let's make it more complicated. If I said, ""I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,"" what do I mean?

It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).

Now you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?

You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.

WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?

This is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That's $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.

WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?

When you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.

WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING

So you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money. That's because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.

Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.

Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don't need to worry about that.

Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics.

Due to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.

Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.


I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS

You can sell your contracts at any time. You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS

Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.

OK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT

A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.

The End.

SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?

No. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don't go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I'm not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose.","I see a lot of people wanted to follow up on this, so I am reposting and hoping the original author doesn't mind.

17,mhg7ai," Greetings, my fellow degenerates.

Last week, I posted my first ever DD on MVIS. You can read it here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs\_friday\_dd\_mvis/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs_friday_dd_mvis/)

If you missed it, today MVIS took flight as it pulled 50%ish on the day. It took liftoff at the start of power hour and, after 20 glorious minutes, began the trend sideways to eventually close at $18.55 (up from sub-$14.00).

**Why did this happen?**

Well, Microsoft won a contract with the U.S. Army for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 B over 10 years: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

I believe, as I explain in my DD, MVIS is going to continue it's rise all throughout 2021. I have different price targets depending on scenarios but for the short-term, I believe MVIS will hit $29 by end of the month (APR).

**How will it get there? What's new this past week besides the spike?**

1. MVIS is going to be showing off their LiDAR in an APR demo. They were still on track to meet their goals during their last report.
2. Biden Infrastructure Plan - Building a national EV charging system, promoting vehicle exchanges from less efficient gas-powered cars to full EV or hybrid EVs. EVs and autonomous vehicles go hand-in-hand so this plan is great for MVIS as well.
3. MORE job openings (up to 17 now thus confirming my claim last week that hiring would ramp up): [http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj](http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj)
4. Buyout possibility still on the table from a T1 tech company that *may or may not* already be invested in MVIS tech (RE: MVIS DD)
5. MVIS dropped hard with the NASDAQ dumping last week but as of today is the BEST recovery stock impacted
6. Short-interest is still a factor with &gt;1 day to cover:

Short Volume Ratio: 13% (down from 30% last week) - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis)

% of Volume Shorted as of Mar. 30: 33.46% (down from 64.98% last week) - [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS)

% of Shares Shorted: 15.32% (up from 12.64% last week) - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/)

Summary Quote: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&amp;submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&amp;submit=Short+Quote)

There are excellent long and short-term opportunities to play here. So for those feeling the FOMO, I believe there's still plenty of time to get in even if the sub-$14.00 bargain price is gone.

A few weeks ago i stumbled upon this company which excavates metals in Quebec, at the moment they are drilling sample holes in their soil to figure out where exactly they wish to start excavating. Yesterday they posted their drilling results so far which were quite promising.

Another interesting thing about this company is its ticker, i have absolutely no idea who gave them the permission to list stocks under that name, eitherway, it is in my opinion an interesting way to attract investors. As of now nearly 23% of their shares are held by institutions

**(This is not about GME - I like the stock)**

However everyday I come to this forum and see same 5-10 tickers of stocks that I wouldn't touch with a 10ft pole. I see the same old story on every single one of these posts - it looks something like this:

**40% SHORT INTEREST ON (INSERT TICKER) GOING TO THE MOON, SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING** 

Let me just put this out there. Actual short squeezes are incredibly rare and it takes astounding amounts of retardation for the possibility to exist. And I will admit some people actually do great technical analysis and examine stocks from an unbias perspective and those are not the people I am referring to.

These posts often contain no fundamental analysis of said ticker nor do they even mention anything about what the company actually does. They are blatant pumps for terrible companies that in my opinion shouldn't even exist. The people that post this shit don't disclose their positions in the company, downvote your critiques, and don't provide any real helpful information about the stock. Its all just loosely pieced together technical jargon that doesn't actually mean anything.

What's worse is there are a lot of people who have come here as first time investors and buy into some of these companies. I'm not saying its bad to buy these businesses - but its bad to have them pitched as something that they're not. Please do your own research, often a 1 minute google search can end up saving you thousands of dollars.

**RISK FACTORS MOVING FORWARD - MY BOOMER BEAR THESIS**

While these stocks can often make you a lot of money when you invest properly. They are also exposed to a lot of macro economic risk and can quite literally go tits up overnight. Here are some of the macro economic risks I think people should consider with all their investments in the near term.

1) Jerome Powell can raise interest rates whenever the fuck he wants. If he ""deems"" the recovery is ahead of schedule he will likely do this. You will shit yourself seeing how fast investors yoink their cash out of these low cap speculative companies when the free money disappears. It is my personal belief that many of these growth stocks will go bankrupt or be bought out within a year of rates rising. If you get caught holding the bag you better hope for the latter.

2) Inflation. While the fed says drastic inflation wont be a problem - that only refers to consumer products. INFLATION is already here in so many assets, stocks included. Understand the market has been in the shitter the last few months but somehow all the indexes are around their ATHs. What would normally be considered a penny stock for some reason has a 10B market cap.

3) Autistic debt. The past 12 years interest rates have been near 0, giving businesses and people alike to get cheap and productive loans. But for every good loan there is 5 autistic ones waiting to bankrupt people and businesses as soon as the cash dries up. I'm talking 200k student loans for humanities degrees, loans for vacant commercials real estate, PPP loans for businesses that should have went under anyways, etc. 

I'm not so autistic to tell you when all these risk factors will come into play, but they will happen sooner or later and the last place you want your cash is in these low cap growth stocks. 

So don't buy into the hype without understanding the risks you are taking when buying some of these stocks. **I'm not talking about the apes yoloing their life savings into same day expiry call options - those autists know what they are doing and I applaud their courage.** I'm talking about the Jordan Belfort types here selling you penny stocks on this forum. They don't disclose their positions, downvote any counter arguments, and basically do everything it takes to make their post seem like a legit investment opportunity. While many of these posts are reported and deleted some linger for longer than they should.

Maybe I'm the retarded one, but I just hate the fact the people come here for the first time and leave with a negative opinion about investing because they were deceived.

From what I can gather it is an electronic quotation service provided by FINRA, and apparently it only deals with selling trade data of certain stocks to those who are subscribed to their service. But my question is: If it is only a data trading service, why would it be showing up on the Level II data like that? Is this somehow their way of extracting data from the stock market?

78,mhgqnv,"Hi fellow investors,

I want to break down why the stock is currently floating at high 7$ - Low 8$ right now and also discuss some positive sentiments in the upcoming months. 

1) Let’s start with what’s currently going on. $UWMC has a short interest of %10.72 on a float of 92.5M shares. This is very high for the amount of shares available in the public float. 92.5M \* %10.72 = 9,916,000 shares. 9,991,600 shares times let’s say 8$ your looking at $79,328,000, and that’s if it was shorted at 8$. Total float of 92.5M @ $8 =  $740,000,000. So, with this being in mind, the stock can be considered having quite a high short interest pertaining to the available public float. 

Please refer below (Short Volume %):

2) UWMC announced that they're considering a Senior Notes Offering not to be confused with Senior Debt, of $700,000,000. This is to be used to pay of their MSR and for other corporation purposes. This has both detracted some investors and attracted investors at the same time. Is this a bad thing? Not all, it’s simply a way of raising capital for the company. Think venture capital, inside investors etc. The interest rate would be locked in at %5.5 which is very low and to be paid in 2029. This is actually a smart decision depending on how you look at it to pay off debt owed with a lower and cheaper interest loan. It’s essentially, a senior convertible bond. Prominent start ups and companies expected to have high growth typically use this option as it reduces risk and lowers interest. I mean, I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty of explaining what Senior Notes are, I’m sure someone will in the comments section for those interested. Senior notes are not considered good nor bad. They can be considered bad when a company is sinking like when GM went bankrupt but would be considered good for growing companies such as UWMC who are using it to strengthen their balance sheets and grow their business. Some investors see senior notes and sell out and that is one aspect of the reason for some sell offs. (This is not something to be concerned with at all, personal opinion). The senior note was proposed but has not been finalized in any way. What does this impact to your investment and the stock price? Apart from some people selling out of the stock, it has little affect.

The 3 big factors for the stock price chilling at around high $7 - $8 currently are 1) Current bearish market 2) High short volume % 3) Senior Note announcement/consideration. (Again, this is not a negative thing).

Positive sentiments: Dividends payout in April, will be added to the the Russel 1000 &amp; 3000, if interest/inflation goes up that’s when UWMC or the wholesale channel in general actually makes more profit/revenuw than Refi companies like RKT. So, all this inflation and interest talk going around, this would actually benefit UWMC to my understanding and not go against them. It would actually make them more competitive since wholesalers/brokers provide better rates, that’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. The other biggest factors for positive sentiments is the fact that the stock is extremely undervalued, great fundamentals, and has a solid balance sheet. This isn’t a GME or an AMC, etc. This stock is a completely different play all together and a great hedge in this bearish market; that’s currently on sale at it's current price and provides high dividend payouts of %4.83 or $0.10 per share quarterly.

This is not financial advice, this is just my personal DD on the current price range UWMC is currently trading at. Have faith and patience my fellow investors and put those 💎🖐 to the test. (Disclaimer: Do whatever you want, I'm personally going to 💎🖐 no doubt).

I hope this proves useful to you in some way or another and that you all make a bunch of tendies. 🚀🌔
