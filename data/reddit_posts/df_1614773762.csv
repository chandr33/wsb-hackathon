49,lwsqg7,"Listen Swamp Fox here, I found this chicken coup that's not guarded by any dogs. Coast is clear for now, you better eat as much chickens and eggs as possible. Cuz the dogs and bears are coming for our gains and chickens. $AMC is safe to go to the moon for a few days but will taper off next week. Saddle the fuck up, stay the fuck away from $GME unless you have balls of steel and trying to catch an aneurysm. But if you time it well, you might drive a new car. But I can't assure you. I will say, today's pop of $GME was a change of CFO in the company, showing they are serious about their management. So, it might be a legit company but the sugar rush can get you killed.
I'm not too greedy, so Imma stick with the smaller chicken, $AMC does have a solid balance sheet and very low debt. Soon to be acquired. I think there may be three pops.


1. Riding the $GME meme stock wave, but tapers cuz Wallstreet gonna bitch a little and Robinhood might do their fuckery. 

2. The second pop gonna piggyback on the news for opening 13 theaters in the east coast in March. I think it might taper off due to mix reactions of the theaters opening.

3. The third one I think it's gonna be related to being acquired cuz I think the players will see the potential in $AMC to integrate it into their existing streaming service.

 If I were in the mind of any company let's say Amazon or Netflix who are currently in talks on acquiring the mega cinema movie chain.
 
This would be the perfect opportunity to recoup lost revenue from 2020 COVID pandemic shutdown,bit will bolster their revenue by expanding the existing A-Lister program from $AMC to either companies existing streaming service subscriptions. And I would provide discount deals to like 20% off to combine the streaming service and enjoying the new ticket movie reservation experience at the theaters.

Somewhat similar to what HBO max is doing, but there's a possibility that the streaming service titans will now have a new jar that they can stick they hands in, the movies theater and distribution industry. Because if they own the movies, they now can receive their cut from movie distribution like Disney who hold their properties close to the chest to play their movies on the newly owned theaters. Some movies that either streaming service owns rights to, they'll have the more affordable plans without the theater plan if that customer isn't comfortable to go to the theaters or even prefer the comfort of their home. How ever it goes, it's going to be a solid win for either Amazon or Netflix.

That's just an opinion and an idea of mine. I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own research. I'm just a Fox who loves fucking shit up in the Swamp and help other to eat some too if they're silly as I am.
