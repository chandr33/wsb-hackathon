Having to find a McDonalds or Starbucks that wont kick you out while your charging your shitty phone/laptop to look for a gig, and the only glory you have is possibly a hotel at the end of the week hitching or just living hard. My recommendation Melvin? Get yer shittin pants on, Ramen noodles and chili mixed together, its good protein and mix's well with malt liquor.

18,m18gp8,"If you guys are looking for a nice squeeze that is not $GME $200 buy in, $SOS is the one. They are a cryptomining company based in China, and multiple hedges said they were shorting them because they think they are frauds. $SOS said in a PR statement last week that they were working on a more detailed statement, and that statement has finally dropped!   


Before the hedges came in, $SOS was a $15 stock. It is now in the low $6. With their rigs, they are able to mine more than $RIOT and $MARA, and they are getting more rigs as well. It is criminal that they are this low because of the shorting.   


[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sos-responds-to-frequently-asked-questions-from-its-shareholders-301243460.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sos-responds-to-frequently-asked-questions-from-its-shareholders-301243460.html)  


They answered every part of the Hindenburg's short report, even with videos of their rigs. It is just a matter of time apes, for those still in it, let's hold strong.

97,m18n79,"PSA. Start using a STOCK ALARM APP instead of limit sells because you’re worried you’ll miss the rocket. 🚀🦍💎
(The iOS app I recommend below will call you for the alert that you set)

PSA
People that are setting limit sells because they’re scared there going to miss it. READ HERE. 
There is a simple solution. Download a app that alerts you if stock does x. You can set many different kinds of alert one for example, if stock reaches x price it alerts. If you’re on ios use “StockAlarm” the free version will send you a push notification but also, here’s the kicker, CALL YOU. So if you set there contact to you’re favorites and also set emergency bypass(very top of the ringtone selection page) the call will go through no matter if you’re phones on silent, do not disturb etc and the app actually recommends this.... if you’re not on ios there are plenty of apps still. I recommend finding one that does calls though because I feel that is the best kind of a alert. And one last thing when this rocket takes off. It’s not gonna be for 10 mins, 1 hour, 1 day. It will be days. It WILL fluctuate. Don’t be scared if it hits 10k and drops back down. If you really can’t diamond hands sells a few shares or whatever it takes to cover you’re original investment(it’s be better not too for everyone) but it’s better than completely paper handing and sell them all.  
I will see you all fellow apes on Pluto, don’t HOP off early and get left behind on the moon.

EDIT for Android some options are” UPLIFT” and “my stock portfolio” these are ones people commented they use(I have never used those two, not sure if they have a call option)
For iOS i recommend “StockAlarm” it will call you as an alert if you choose. Make sure to set to contacts and turn emergency bypass on(top of ringtone selection)",START USING A STOCK ALERT APP SO YOU DONT HAVE TO WATCH TICKERS ALL DAY(THIS ONE WILL CALL YOU-FREE),1.0,1615303354,iforgotmymainacc
