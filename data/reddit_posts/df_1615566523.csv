19,m3l9wi,"I am curios, when I watched the stock market I notice that the price jumps up at the opening, then gets shortlattered all the way to oblivion. AMC and GME are practically a mirror.

The news is reporting that the hedges are covering their borrowed shorts. Could they possibly be buying short back on every market opening, then short laddering the price down at close. Rinse and repeat.

If they do this enough they could be able to cover all their shorts and also not risk a huge spike in both the price and interest fee.

Around 11:34am EST, the stock market was bouncing back. I wondered, if this was the time to buy. If the stock was gonna bounce around or go lower. Here's how the graph looked like -

There is a sign in this graph. You might not see it at first but if you use better graphing tools and some copy and pasting. You will see something beautiful -

I think GM has more gas left in the tank even after this run.  I took this gain because the size of position had grown and with the expiration next week I decided to lock this in, as well as I'm transferring out of Interactive Brokers.  I still have 20 more calls (also shown below) that I'll try to press to a $60 strike before closing/rolling that position.

My basic premise is that while most are viewing GM's rise as an EV play, the share gains are actually because of Boomer metrics.  GM is producing too much cash and growing earnings too much to have a dying industrial PE multiple.  They're sandbagging earnings and have a history of such.  When they beat earnings again next quarter, GM will moon, again.  You don't have to view GM as a Tesla rival to have tendies print now because of large SUV's.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
