I will wager that if one were to add up all the GME shares belonging to all us WSB apes and adjunct apes (uncles, babysitters, grandmas, wives’ boyfriends) that we actually collectively own a rather large chunk of GME. So why not we demand our scion, our prophet, our dear leader and messiah u/DeepFuckingValue sit on the board of directors to represent us and our interests? It makes so much intuitive sense to me.

I’m smooth-brained as fuck but I’m sure there are many of you autists out there who would know how to make this happen... SO HOW DO WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN?! DFV put us on the moon; the least we can do is put him on the board! Assuming, that is, that he would deign to.

24,m2jian,"In light of today’s events, (or yesterday’s depending on where you live), I’ve seen many new apes wondering what exactly a hedge fund is and why it was able to cause such a drastic drop in their stonks. I’m here to answer that question.

I myself am a relatively new member of this specific community, however, I was on WSB when the first run of GME commenced and I’m here for the second. However, I mostly am invested in AMC. Rather, I was in GME the first round, but am riding AMC this time and bought a little of GME on the dip today. Still, I have been investing for years, so I’d like to think I know what I am talking about. 

To put it simply, a hedge fund is a group in which  multiple investors get together to be able to invest aggressively and eliminate risk. The reason they are able to affect our stocks is because today, there were enough groups of them that got together and tried to cause a panic sell so that they could meet their short requirements. (More on that below) To delve a little deeper into what makes a hedge fund tick, I’ve grouped it out a little bit.

In hedge funds, limited partners contribute money so that the general partner can manage it. The general partner then invests the money however they see fit and hope to make a return on the investment. Since there is more money to spend, the risk is not as great, and the hedgie can invest in riskier ventures. Then, once a profit is made, the general partner pulls out, distributes the earnings to the limited partners and keeps a cut for themselves.

Now the hedgies we deal with in GME, AMC, NOK and all the other were shorting these stocks when we got into the game. That means they were planning on making a profit from a stock that was decreasing in value. When shorting a stock, it has to hit a certain price, otherwise the investor has to keep buying in order to cover their loss. So, when the hedgies sold off today, their goal was to cause us to panic sell, resulting in their shorts being fulfilled and them turning their profits. However, most of us held and we recover quickly. (Some of you didn’t hold, and I am disappointed in you. Think of me as your wife’s boyfriend.) Had the hedgies successfully pulled this off, they would have made their profit and we would be finished. 

I hope this helps those of you who were confused out a bit. For more information, I’ve included a link below.

Remember the other day I posted for people to remind family members that might be investing with a lot of these big brokers and hedge funds whatever it may be that they might be invested in 401k, we got to remember them,  just tell them to look at their portfolios please. A buddy of mine thank goodness he looked at his because he realized it has gone down 25% in last 3 weeks and I'm not going to name the company's he's with, cuz he still has his money invested by them, he did tell me but it's not about that, it's about making people aware of the situation and what is going on and I thank you guys because you got to think of others while you're prospering, others are getting their ass whooped, like we've been for a long time. I still am but that's okay it's not about me.

Now this is what I feel is very important and I'll leave this up for a discussion and hopefully we can accomplish what I'm thinking of and I have a way that all this can play into our favor even quicker and faster. Two things I think it's all we need to do:

1) all right a little note that explains what these hedge funds have been doing to mislead all the public so that people sell or not buy at all so they can recoup their money and put out these fake bitchass stocks to try and dilute so it hurts us... it hurts people like (I hate to say me again but I'm doing the options, so I buy 2 weeks out every week but for them not paying and them not honoring their end by taking these stocks and borrowing them and then selling them shorting them and then reselling them and basically they're loaning out s*** that ain't theirs or that's not available that's not real, so for them doing that, they get to screw people like me that's carrying 30 to 70 options a week... 

2)  okay then I will add with it or what I'm asking the community for, is to look for things that people have been posting or revealed misleading info to the public doing for instance, Bots saying something but something different is happening , or something huge from the HEDGIES puting out misleading info, News Cast misleading, or large firms that are all involved in shorting. But the first thing is I would like to have like five sectors of proofs of their corruption or they're misleading information to the public to convince them to walk away from AMC.

So lies or misleading information from the following:
 
1) News Cast
2) Hedge Funds 
3) Brokers
4) Radio
5) News Adds 
6) Bots 

Today was a crazy day and I think it can get even crazier... if I can get this help and get this done before Friday morning ,  then I send it up to you guys whoever thinks we can change this or change that or whatever I don't care I'm open I'm a team player but I think we need so we can Mass produce it....
One thing that is psychological is when you see a photo one time cool when you see it twice huh a third time is this a coincidence and then 5 10 15 100 times that's what this can do if we can dig up some really cool info to provide to those on the edge that don't have the confidence to stay and hold not sell. And to reassure all them and those that may not be on here with us we can still reach out to them through all of us. Thanks guys let me know what you think add to the link here let's roll on this let's get some info out to people so that they're convinced to hold on to these stocks and then if I need some help buying some of these options but I'm going to buy some more but let's buy some bye bye bye....

What I propose is that whatever the outcome of GME, those so inclined should invest the same concerted and independent effort in any public stock they deem worth supporting or salvaging. Let us revujenate businesses big and small, far and wide for any positive cause. Let us spread our knowledge and experience to those unbeknownst to our ways.

94,m2k0q8,I had two GME I bought at 117 a few weeks ago.  Today during the fall I (stupidly sold them at 235) I was adding money to my TD account at the same time and ended up buying back two GME at 225.  My account is less than the shares and says I have cash available but a negative margin available.. So it’s showing I have $486 but each share is worth 257.  Help make sense of this for me without talking to me like an actual idiot. Lol thanks,I have a stupid question because I’m new. Please help answer this for me.,1.0,1615445439,barmenarts
