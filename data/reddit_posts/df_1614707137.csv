To his surprise he actually made $1000 one week and several hundred dollars per week up until Christmas and then it just completely evaporated and never rebounded. Now he says he is lucky to make $100 a week scanning the Instacart app all day long 7 days a week . The truth of the matter is people just don’t use Instacart like they use Amazon, Uber, grub hub or any of these other delivery services. And if you do a little due dilly you read nothing but terrible reviews about Instacart. In theory the Instacart concept is a great idea but they aren’t the ones to make this idea great. Maybe their business boomed a little during the pandemic but with vaccination and reopening’s it’s not sustainable. This company is dog shit at best. This is all Uber-hyper exaggerated bullshit and this valuation beyond ludicrous!

Looks like GME is currently entrenched in a tight upward trending channel. You can see every time we test the bottom of the channel it bounces right back and heads higher. Using this trend i speculate it could close at around $130-$135.
