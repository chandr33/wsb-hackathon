They know how many people set stop loss, they just press a button to calculate the domino stop loss. 
For example, they sell 10%, cause another 10% paper hands who set stop loss, that's total 20%, and that triggered another 5% and goes on until it ends...

To counter ? Do ""NOT"" set stop loss!! (At least until 3/19 the option boom)

Because you know the price will go right back up, gme was at $198 and went back to $250 in a matter of seconds. Whoever set $200 stop loss you not only lost tons of profit and you are left behind again.
