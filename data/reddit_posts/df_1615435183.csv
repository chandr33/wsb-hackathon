WSB has a active users over 400k regularly
but its posts in my opinion doesn't equal the user base

after a long day of eating crayons and faping off
their is nothing better then thumbing through the subreddit's and taking in other people's point of view

but as of recently I've noticed a disturbing trend of a shear lack of content on this subreddit

Challenge!
Set your filter to new and keep refreshing
you will see posts published and removed within 1 minute.

also notice the time between posts I've seen less then 5 in a 7-8 min time frame.

with 400k active users it's making my Teflon brain  hurt
The percentage of users to posters and the time-lapse between posts in my opinion is (retarded)

Ow my brain, from research and analyzing patterns. Back from Q3 of 2020 up until recently. They've had some shorts recently. They seemed greatly undervalued as they have a lot of resources and influence, to really expand fiber connections in areas with only 1 or 2 choices for gigabit speeds. And yes, they've consistently lost subscribers to their lower income and low profit subscribers. But they are aggressively expanding the fiber connections and adding new fiber infrastructure. Plus the new ISP competition they've taken on with buying CenturyLink, have never truly lived up to their advertising. CenturyLink couldn't seem to pull it off themselves. 
 
 Their many other endeavors seem to have a great deal of potential. I met with them through a virtual meeting. Had a brief presented my business expansion plan for one of my smart and green property tech startups. They are offering a lot in funding, looking for startups to benefit their growth the year.

Plus they have a high yield. I believe 10%. Check them out. Could have some potential. Only worry how these changes to net neutrality could affect their growth potential.

I have have 3 people I talk to about stocks frequently every day.  Before today, they have never owned a share of GME even after I explained to them the clear bullishness of this stock for weeks. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot friends I know, but hear me out. They are all watching Gme, they are telling people who were also already watching, and those people told more people who were NOT watching.

Why am I even mentioning this?

Through the blatantly clear planed dip (algorithm or not), these 3 friends all bought GME on the dip. They have never owned a share prior. They finally came clear to their senses that there is desperation and manipulation in the way it trades. Other than that, they bought for two reasons:

- they aren‚Äôt true re*ards, so they see the clear doji stick on the daily after an desperate attempt of pushing GME down. 

- they are angry just like us apes now. It‚Äôs a trade fueled by wanting justice, combined with fundamentals/technical bullish signs.

My friends saw an opportunity to buy Gme and truly believe that 250 was a steal! 2 weeks ago people believed 40 was too high. It gets better. 

They work from home and have chat groups with colleagues. They now have long call options and shares. My boomer Uncle Bob even caved in after being brainwashed by media for decades! The facts all point towards buy and hold that‚Äôs why they bought. That‚Äôs why their friends told their friends to buy. We‚Äôre are getting more united everyday and hfs are only delaying the inevitable.  

Inevitable..we say it a lot, but never dig deep into what it really means. 

If that dip was an algorithm attack then guess what? Charts don‚Äôt lie, especially with volume. If it wants to go up then that same algorithm system will be forced to make the stock go up it - supply and demand. Test and retest resistance and support - the market is roughly 85% algorithms..look it up. We‚Äôre not against anything, but OURSELVES. Do you get it?? Think about it...I mean it‚Äôs easy money so you can afford to use a little bit of brain power. Some people see lines go up when looking at a stock, I see a psychological battle take blade. In other words, you‚Äôre not in a boxing ring, you‚Äôre in a psychological warfare against the inevitable. 

Inevitable tendies is because of algorithms.

Sometimes it‚Äôs best to keep it simple. Algorithms don‚Äôt have gray areas. Just like 2+2=4. It‚Äôs not maybe 4, it‚Äôs just 4. This isn‚Äôt constitutional law, it‚Äôs math. It is now known that we have the ape power to make it as simple as Buy+Hold = Moon. The charts are bullish because of this. Algorithms fuel psychology via fake bull/bear signs and media reports. It‚Äôs a mix of emotion and people falling for the hedge fund tricks.  With GME, I believe the psychology fuels the chart because apes together strong. 
 
A lot of money should be coming into the market tomorrow with the stimi. Let‚Äôs have fun and stay focused. Let‚Äôs get it.

I followed this sub for a long time, had even unsubscribed because it wasn't relevant to my life for a bit.  Came back during the first wave of GME-tardiness.  


I started learning.  Reading up on how stocks work, what programs to use(still not completely sold that I made the right choice there, time will tell), started bugging all my friends that had ever even mentioned stocks before, pissed several off with incessant questions.  Learned what buys, sells, calls, puts, and shorts mean.


Got a few friends interested, and some have even joined in and we now share info, DD and tips.  My sister has done great at this over the last few weeks, she probably has learned more than me, and will rub it in if/when she reads this.


And now I've successfully bought a few shares in a few stocks.  Missed the dip on GME, going to have to catch the rocket next time.  And I'm very cash poor.  


But just wanted to make a post to look back on when I'm dipping my tendies in cocaine sauce to point to and say, that's when I started.


I bought 6 shares of a couple fairly stable stocks today(mostly to see how the UI of my app work and kinda dip my toes in) and made about 5% gain.  It's the smallest start, I only have $30 I'm starting with, gonna challenge myself to double it every month.


Just wanted to share my story, I'll see you all around, and looking forward to making some real gains soon!
