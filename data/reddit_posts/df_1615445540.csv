1,m2k26n,"Holy fuck people. There's a post on a certain stock-ticker-named subreddit where a dude is trying to get everyone whipped up and throw hate at the marketwatch journalist who wrote an article on the crash. They're using the photo of a news app showing it as published before the crash happened. Apps screw up times all the goddamn time. You can also fake that shit easily. Am I saying it's faked? I'm saying who fucking knows what happened, but it's pretty shit evidence no matter what.

I've seen more posts like this come up throughout the day, so I don't think this is an isolated thing I'm seeing.

HODL.

If that message meant something to you, we‚Äôre together. All others, we know you‚Äôre here. Your paper hands might have cost you a trip to the moon, but just know that we still have room for you on this rocket ship.

For you bears, you believe can simply run a sentiment analysis on us and have it all figured out?! All we want is your shares, just give up and go home. This is our jungle.

Apes with ADD, like me. Probably time to exit until morning.

Avoid day trading this, funds want to load up on your shares. If you‚Äôre fine with my imaginary girlfriends real boyfriends brother in law who‚Äôs a complete dick taking your seat to the moon, so be it. Otherwise, for a one time free offer of a moon shot, just HODL.

Institutional investors want your shares. They want to trigger fear in the shrewdness of apes., The goal? To acquire more and more shares while hedging their losses on large sale orders through put options. This reduces their liquidity, while being able to disguise the size of their bet currently in the pot.

My imaginary girlfriends real boyfriend is sleeping on the floor tonight, because I sold my long term investments for the best our shrewdness. As we reduce the number of active shares in the market, the value will increase due to the lack of supply.

HODL Strong, degents.

28,m2k850,"Granted, this may sound a bit retarded, but hear me out. *adjusts tinfoil hat* I think this was a coordinated effort between a bunch of HFs and a group of whales who are friends of the HFs. The tactic: psychological manipulation via predictive coding. For those with smooth brains, per Wikipedia: ""Predictive coding is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment."" The environment is the stonk market, specifically GME. The model is what happened in January, specifically the run-ups/subsequent drop-offs. In other words, their play isn't actually over.

Most apes already know what happened last time; basically what happened today, followed by price explosion, followed by canceled buy buttons for retailers, followed by failure to launch, and temporary price stagnation (hovering around $40). With the momentum destroyed, they had time to breathe and plan their next move. THIS IS THAT MOVE. And it is NOT the same move as last time. Unlike before, they can't turn off the buy button, not after the scrutiny generated from when it happened previously. Even if they did, surely they know the diamond-handed apes have legit brokers now, like Fidelity, Ameritrade, Vanguard, etc. So what is a desperate HF to do? Call in the cavalry (whale friends) to make it SEEM like the shorts were attacking. This is where the predictive coding comes in...

Each time the price got too intense for the shorts, they attacked (short ladders, FUD, MSM shilling, etc). We know this. Because we know this, we are EXTREMELY likely to think that's what is happening now, but on a massive scale (if you don't believe me, just go look at all the posts about this exact thing). It's been laughably reliable, even. A solid model, one could say. That's why I'm inclined to think this is different. HFs get a bunch of their whale buddies with ~1m shares between them to tank the price in return for being told when to sell again next time, right before the actual short attack occurs. They take profit, buy the dip in preparation for what is to come. Retail investors get all hyped up and lulled into a false sense of security because they think, ""we gottem, retards! No short selling for you!"" When in reality, their real play is to drop it even harder on Friday. Imagine if it hits $790 on Friday (I don't see them ""allowing"" it to hit the $800 mark, if they can help it) and apes start selling to cover their cost basis, plus the whales selling (again), plus massive short attacks they've been prepping for days/weeks, plus paperhands on the way down selling out of fear that they are missing their moment. It'll be an insane mess of a price plummet, the likes of which they hope will finally break retail's spirit. SPOILER ALERT: It won't.

Power to the Player

TL;DR: HFs want to take advantage of the fact that we think their behavior is predictable. I think they schemed with whales to simulate a massive short attack as a ruse to cover the real short attack for Friday.","Newbie POV on GME - ""The Hedgefund Fake""",1.0,1615446233,Bradduck_Flyntmoore

Share your ideas below! Here are a few from the other thread to get the ideas flowing:

&amp;#x200B;

* Vlad's past in Bulgaria fully fleshed out -- every time he appears on screen he turns away to start monologuing about his childhood like Tweek's parents advertising their coffee 
* Return of Cartman Jim Cramer
* WoW dude returns as a shill/FUDster to get his revenge for the kids beating him at WoW
* Randy is the DFV wannabe. Sells Tegridy Farms and goes all in- ""We're going to the moon Sharon!!"" When trading gets halted by Vlad from his little hut in Bulgaria, he gets the answering machine...""Hi this is Robinhood, go fuck yourself."" Then Randy signs up for every brokerage account available to buy more
* Cartman sells at the $40 bottom and gets salty when it goes up, flies to wall street and becomes a hedge fund manager to make sure the other guys don't get rich
* Butters has half a share on accident he received when playing a computer game. Finds out at the last minute and sells at the absolute top to become the richest person in South Park
* Elon guest stars. He's been on the show before, he'd surely come back to add more insult to the real-life shorts injury",Idea thread: WSB + GME SOUTH PARK EPISODE (or entire season!),1.0,1615446706,BENshakalaka

55,m2ke8k,"[Though the drop yesterday (-50%) was not as harsh as it was end of January when the buying was restricted from several brokers (roughly $450 -&gt; $120; -73%), certainly some people are getting Vietnam like flashbacks.](https://i.imgur.com/qfHshJ4.jpg) After the stock plummeted end of January and yesterday there was a (technical?) countermovement on roughly 2/3 of the original value (end of January it was something like $360, yesterday it settled at about $260). So, should history repeat itself and the stock is going to plummet in the next days as it happened end of January? I don't think so and here are some compelling (?) arguments against that:

 * Market manipulation via short seller and in collaboration with traditional media are pretty obvious at least since yesterday (we speculated about it beforehand). The media reported nearly parallel to the actual drop about GameStop crashing while being quite about the constant rise the days before. It doesn't matter if the articles were pre-written or not.
 * The harsh drop end of January was facilitated by the buying restrictions of brokers (most prominent one RobinHood) **and** a harsh short selling attack from unknown institutions (probably hedgefonds). Such a demoralizing factor doesn't exist right now and I don't think that we are going to see something like that again as there is too much at stake for those respective brokers (hearings et al; in Gemany the most prominent neobroker TradeRepublic is paying compensations). That was a wildcard they could play exactly once.
 * The rise this time to $350 was much more organic than last time. In the first rallye the stock doubled intraday and was much more volatile. There were huge trading volumes in the day before the spike (180-200m per day three times in a row!) whereas this time the trading volume was pretty moderate resulting in ""moderate"" stock rise (ca. +30% per day). There should be a pretty big chance of few resistance lines in the higher $ area. 
 * The transition of GameStop towards a prosperous e-commerce company is real! That was more speculative in January, but the company has announced some pretty positive news (including Ryan Cohen as a chairman as committee for the transition to a digital first e-commerce company). The company is nowhere near a $10 valuation. A drop in regions of &lt; $100 is a pretty good investment opportunity given the news which arouse the last weeks. I can't think of a dip back in regions of $40.
 * The general sentiment is way better than end of January, when the harsh drop combined with the buying restrictions led to stunned disbelief. We have seen the price of the stock fall back and we have seen the price of the stock rise again. People which held to the stock in February are not going to sell now.
 * The most interesting trading week is probably the upcoming week (15.03. ‚Äì 19.03.) as lots of options are set for the 19.03. and there are many potential catalysators for the stock. The people which drove the stock to the heights yesterday know about that and basically nothing have changed. In addition to that the most anticipated Q4/2020 earnings of GameStop are being announced in the week after (new console cycle, traditionally leading to a spike of the stock price).


So all in all I think we are as good to go as we were yesterday and the harsh dip can be seen more as a proof of ""our"" thesis that there are lots of bearish actors (short sellers?) on the other side which have much cash to lose. This game isn't over at all and we are now in charge of the situation.

In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we‚Äôll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.

[Ray Dalio‚Äôs Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it‚Äôs the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the ‚Äúrisk free rate‚Äù for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it‚Äôs the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it‚Äôs a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let‚Äôs go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded üìà price üìâ** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any ü¶ç with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield &amp; 10 Year Yield](https://preview.redd.it/l2f5buijubm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36007c98a80568d8e10210ceb35112f83520f7f)

There‚Äôs several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would‚Äôve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don‚Äôt need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won‚Äôt refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed‚Äôs official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It‚Äôs pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **üöÄ üåù**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **üìâ.** 

[10-Year Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/pjospxbpubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23e515781e1fde96e73ea04d8292ed985710d0ee)

Why did the 10-year yield **üöÄ üåù**?

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

Why does the economy reopening = inflation?

There‚Äôs this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - MV = PQ, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really üìâ fast.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/85liuqosubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2ae9811e158cdf5cfb18124ac36a1964b2ffbf)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed‚Äôs worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/00rnrx4uubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15729986ceccc14e0022cc7090b5e5077819d5c)

By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn‚Äôt enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you‚Äôll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/ft66nwfwubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f00d56caea7069690c3f1f244618f9cee0c5eb7c)

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields üìà and all asset prices **üìâ**

What did JPowell say?

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he‚Äôs changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn‚Äôt be counting on the Fed‚Äôs money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a üåàüêª in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven‚Äôt done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went üìà in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we‚Äôll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **üöÄ üåù** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we‚Äôll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/cspz6f1evbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cbfbe0bb4e6133d03e2ef6f506d64adb61432b)

[Fed Funds Rate](https://preview.redd.it/aujgi1jevbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78424f8f64d996a8557d22da8ea84c5cc9cb1299)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we‚Äôve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for this chapter is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade‚Äôs stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy.

***TLDR; Stonks only go  üìà if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME üöÄ üåù when everything else üìâ**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I‚Äôll talk about this too. I‚Äôm sure some of y‚Äôall have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually üìà and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their ‚Äúnet exposure‚Äù, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn‚Äôt as risky because they are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they‚Äôve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It‚Äôs pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they‚Äôll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

87,m2kl3l,"[Though the drop yesterday (-50%) was not as harsh as it was end of January when the buying was restricted from several brokers (roughly $450 -&gt; $120; -73%), certainly some people are getting Vietnam like flashbacks.](https://i.imgur.com/qfHshJ4.jpg) After the stock plummeted end of January and yesterday there was a (technical?) countermovement on roughly 2/3 of the original value (end of January it was something like $360, yesterday it settled at about $260). So, should history repeat itself and the stock is going to plummet in the next days as it happened end of January? I don't think so and here are some compelling (?) arguments against that:

 * Market manipulation via short seller and in collaboration with traditional media are pretty obvious at least since yesterday (we speculated about it beforehand). The media reported nearly parallel to the actual drop about GameStop crashing while being quite about the constant rise the days before. It doesn't matter if the articles were pre-written or not.
 * The harsh drop end of January was facilitated by the buying restrictions of brokers (most prominent one RobinHood) **and** a harsh short selling attack from unknown institutions (probably hedgefonds). Such a demoralizing factor doesn't exist right now and I don't think that we are going to see something like that again as there is too much at stake for those respective brokers (hearings et al; in Gemany the most prominent neobroker TradeRepublic is paying compensations). That was a wildcard they could play exactly once.
 * The rise this time to $350 was much more organic than last time. In the first rallye the stock doubled intraday and was much more volatile. There were huge trading volumes in the day before the spike (180-200m per day three times in a row!) whereas this time the trading volume was pretty moderate resulting in ""moderate"" stock rise (ca. +30% per day). There should be a pretty big chance of few resistance lines in the higher $ area. 
 * The transition of GameStop towards a prosperous e-commerce company is real! That was more speculative in January, but the company has announced some pretty positive news (including Ryan Cohen as a chairman as committee for the transition to a digital first e-commerce company). The company is nowhere near a $10 valuation. A drop in regions of &lt; $100 is a pretty good investment opportunity given the news which arouse the last weeks. I can't think of a dip back in regions of $40.
 * The general sentiment is way better than end of January, when the harsh drop combined with the buying restrictions led to stunned disbelief. We have seen the price of the stock fall back and we have seen the price of the stock rise again. People which held to the stock in February are not going to sell now.
 * The most interesting trading week is probably the upcoming week (15.03. ‚Äì 19.03.) as lots of options are set for the 19.03. and there are many potential catalysators for the stock. The people which drove the stock to the heights yesterday know about that and basically nothing have changed. In addition to that the most anticipated Q4/2020 earnings of GameStop are being announced in the week after (new console cycle, traditionally leading to a spike of the stock price).


So all in all I think we are as good to go as we were yesterday and the harsh dip can be seen more as a proof of ""our"" thesis that there are lots of bearish actors (short sellers?) on the other side which have much cash to lose. This game isn't over at all and we are now in charge of the situation.

Any fund caught doing this on a first offense is a fine of half there total net worth, 6 months ban from any trading and no bail outs ever again.

2nd offense is a closure of the fund, a fine of the total net worth, not able to trade ever again even on a personal account. Everything gets liquidated and any losses that incurred to the management of other investors will be split upon all that were involved in the hedge fund as a debt that cannot be dismissed due to bankruptcy.

I for one am tired of them stealing billions from hard working investors only to get bailed out when they make bad decisions, where was our bailout back in 08-09?",Updated Proposition for new penalties/fines for market manipulators,1.0,1615447744,HaveFunStopCamping

But you can bring your thots, girlfriends, or strippers. They get in free of charge (; (They only have access through you though).

This party needs to be big as fuck. Rent a big ass venue or something. Everyone needs to hear about it. And guess what happens when everybody hears about it? Lots more may want to attend the party, so that means that retail is going to be buying even MORE of GME. Driving the price up even MORE. 

Just a cute little thought rn, I'm serious though. This should happen. Not sure if it should be thrown after or before the squeeze though. If you have any suggestions to elaborate on this party/event idea. Please do. Let's make it happen. If it happens ya'll know it's gonna be a crazy ass party.
