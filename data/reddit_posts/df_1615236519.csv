41,m0pw7q,"My fellow Autist, 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, so I don't lose the apes who can't read

**TLDR:** We will launch as this is criminally undervalued and prime to 2x-5x in the next 3 years in a growing igaming &amp; gambling industry. If you like to gamble and game, buy $BFTüöÄüöÄüöÄ. Short term, I see this **above $25 before end of April**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you are still reading and not eating your colorful crayons, good for you. I want to do a deeper dive into $BFT short-term, my positions and what I think a safe floor is. An amazing DD which initially got me can be found here by non other than [dhsmatt2/](https://www.reddit.com/user/dhsmatt2/): [Original DD on $BFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, $BFT is the main payment processors for igaming &amp; gambling in U.S &amp; massive in Europe. If we think short-term next few weeks, we have three events I love. 1) Roblox IPO 2) March Madness 3) Merger Vote

&amp;#x200B;

1) **Roblox IPO-** This will occur this Wednesday. Now, many of you are very excited about this and following recent trends of anticipated IPO's in last 6 months (Air BNB, Dash, AI, Snowflake) all have opened 2x of original price. Roblox uses paysafe for their ENTIRE igaming network... so if you think igaming is going to continue to grow, paysafe/ $BFT is the safe bet. 

[iGaming &amp; Social Media using Paysafe. If you like these stonks and think they will keep growing, having $BFT is a winning ticket. ](https://preview.redd.it/l0jb66ql6vl61.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c797f8f0e9c872c257f543666d92ebb2472fd109)

[Middle Diagram is very very hot from a technical pespective, left and right from growth perspective. ](https://preview.redd.it/4yt63cge7vl61.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3a087dcfdd9c5bd86b431dac3d69db955e87e0)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2) **March Madness-** That's right Apes, its time to sports gamble. March is here and America will be throwing millions away on overgrown chimps who like a round ball and betting outrageous amounts of cash on hunches, alumni connections &amp; stimi checks coming. Now, $BFT/Paysafe is used by the big boys of online gambling too. I have put photos below that show the online gambling paysafe connections. With recent dip in market, SPAC's got wiped out. This went from $18-$19ish a stock to $12.50 last week...back to $15 but with March Madness it will rise with the tide

[Gambling\/ online sports betting. Take a bet on idiots betting will grow. You like $Penn and $DKNG, then you should love $BFT](https://preview.redd.it/k2shiojw7vl61.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d683f95b3c1252cb37507e60f23829ac7270a2d0)

3) **Merger Date-** Get your calendars out you autist. March 25th. $BFT will vote to merge and become $PSFE. Now if you don't know much about big dick bill and SPAC's...the man is not known to miss. He isn't here to fuck spiders or eat rocks. He gets things done &amp; this is his biggest puppy. ALL news (please share if you find otherwise) is pointing to this Merging &amp; once it breaks away from SPAC, I think the massess will be BUYING. 

[If you can read, please do](https://preview.redd.it/xxdm3cas8vl61.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fea729bf0fcd57603cc56fcb29f29eb2422832)

&amp;#x200B;

Now before you spit all your crayons out at once and say whats the catch, the catch is this is a VERY VERY competitive market. Their main competitors are Paypal &amp; Square, but based on EBITDA Paysafe is still **VERY VERY UNDERVALUED.** The gamble/Pro I see here is that Paysafe focuses more on Igaming and gambling, so if you think in next few years this will grow, then this is your horse. 

&amp;#x200B;

[If you can't count, it means that at same valuation\/growth as Paypal they are minimum $35 stock...Square closer to $45.](https://preview.redd.it/hf0uywhk9vl61.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b88a0de69373792d6b6fa84e952efdcfe2bbda7)

Now there are ALOT of smarter apes than me and much more detail online about technicals, growth etc but this is what I see happening. A formula for tendies if you will short term. If you have your own bias, please share in comments. It should also be noted that as a SPAC, institutions haven't been able to get their slimy hands on it, which again will result in long-term growth as I see them EATING this up. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Roblox IPO + March Madness + Merger + Market recovery with stimi + Hedges beginning to pick up positions + experts saying fair-value/floor is $26 (lowest I could find)****= 60% upside on boomer stonks or 5x on calls in next month. I see end of April, $30+ for the stock.***

&amp;#x200B;

*Positions: 380 shares at $13.50 15x $15c 10/15/21 (bought on dip) &amp; continuing to add 5x 4/16/21 $15.5 and 20x 4/16/21 $20c*
