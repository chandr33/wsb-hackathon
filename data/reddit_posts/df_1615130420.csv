19,lzt1m1,"So I joined in January with the first squeeze of gme and amc. And I thought cool a quick couple of bucks so I hopped on and started doing overall stock research riding hype trains never really gaining but losing a couple bucks here and there and eventually putting 90% of my investments back into AMC after the first price drop. But now that I‚Äôve become aware of what‚Äôs going on I see it‚Äôs not just about making money if you are buying AMC or GME you fucking HOLD if your not going to die without the money you do not sell this is about CHANGE. these hedge funds literally make billions off the failure of the American citizen, and it seems they can influence the market pretty heavily in their favor whenever the majority is trying to get their fair share. These guys are already set for life any money they are losing from this whole squeeze is not even affecting their great grandkids inheritance. And yet they are going full blown manipulation mode to stop anything they can. Are they getting scared we will realize we are more powerful then them? I‚Äôm just curious how much longer this can go on for before something changes? Probably changes to help the hedge funds is what we will see before anything. 10 million people at 100$ each could put a pretty good fight against these guys which is why I think we will see changes to the stock market pretty soon to prevent things like this happening again and to keep the billions in their pockets.",It‚Äôs not about the tendies anymore (the more that realize this the better),1.0,1615131587,MoreMall1

If I were to attempt to do so I'd like to try to find information on which stocks could be an easy win.(excluding gamestop of course because I'm pretty sure that ship has long sailed haha.)

&amp;#x200B;

1. OIL calls / shares -- sell end of summer / beg of fall. Generationally cheap --- with re-opening AND constrained supply due to all of the green initiatives, we should see a major runup of oil prices.
2. FINANCIAL calls, in particular I like WFC due to cheap calls. It was in the 50s before COVID reared its ugly head.
3. BABA - beat down by Xi's cockhammer but still absolutely dominant in China. It's the best undervalued tech name (even better than FB in my opinion). BABA also is heavily invested in the China start-up ecosystem, so should do well even with more-than-expected regulation (which I find unlikely)

**Why I like these plays:**

These plays should do well in all 2020 environments.

* Inflation fears due to overstimulus? Oil and financials will do great while BABA, given how cheap it is, will be flat.
* Inflation fears overblown yet reopening moves forward? All 3 should do extremely well.
* New COVID strain renders current vaccines useless -- BABA will do well and oil/financials will be flat. This is just unlikely to happen, boyz. Even with new variants things will continue to open up.

The only way to lose money is if we have a zombie apocalypse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions**

1. WFC:  June 50c or 45c and sold 4/16 puts to pay for the calls. 1000 shares.
2. BABA: 710 shares -- no options as I don't have a good thesis on WHEN it will moon.
3. XOM, OXY, CPE, MRO, MPC -- various shares and options with different strikes from next month through August. Also selling puts to pay for the calls. 200k into it overall.

Now that the world is slowly reopening with Covid still around, all eyes are on ways to reduce ways of the virus to spread. That's why I'm thinking about placing a bet on air purifier manufacturers.

A Dutch scientist found that those machines filter around 90% of aerosols out of the air during studies in a gym, an American article even puts it at 99,9%.

So I think there's going to be a huge run on these filters (and maybe even legislation demanding them to be present in buildings when it turns out the virus is indeed spread by aerosols, judgement is still out on that one)

For example

why do we need to wait for shorts data for 15 days? Why not daily?

why do we have to do guess work on market data? Why cant it be published daily region wise, break down grouped between institutional and individual buying and selling without revealing names or any privacy data

When a particular large value trade tips market scales of a specific stock, why not more details of the trade disclosed?  I for sure know of one large trade that happened on a Friday at 3.25 PM.  It is an option put trade thar triggered back to back sale of its underlying also.  The trade value was so large for that symbol at that time of Friday, that these option and back to back underlying trades together pulled underlying price by nearly 17% in 10 mins, wiping nearly $4 Billion in market cap.  The trade size was just $1 Million.  Can you believe? i cant mention stock symbol here since discussing that symbol name here would cause bots delete this post. Those who trade in that symbol know what i am saying.

Similarly, when market sharply corrects quick time, no transparency who is selling, why they are selling, when will it normalise.  Even the present 10% correction you see, media is reporting ‚Äúinstitutional traders may be worried of rising inflation, bond yields, insane valuations‚Äù.  Why cant media speak to top 5-10 institutions and quote them in their posts?

90,lzu4nr,"Ok listen up fuckbags, I spent some time in the weekend sniffing the green crayons I found and chewed the black ones. But I also did some research on what to do when you get a huge influx of money like you retarded ape are about to get when you sell each share for 500k.

I would like to state that fuck you Kenny G, and that the SEC can suck my trail mix. But I am not a financial advisor and you should not listen to me. We are not a group, and there is no we. 

First, I would like to address why you should miss the peak and sell on the way down. If you ape sell a share before the peak, you limit your upside of selling that share at a higher price AND you limit how high the peak can go, by adding liquidity to the market you help shorts leave their positions for a bargain and at the same time you screw other apes by limiting how high the peak can go. If you wait out and sell AFTER the peak, you allow the price to go its full way and you alongside other apes can sell their shares for a higher price even if you don‚Äôt sell at the peak I believe it is better to hold, miss the 1M per share peak and start selling at 700k instead of selling at 100k missing a possible 600k profit PER SHARE. But that is just me, do whatever the fuck you want. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Again I remind you this shouldn¬¥t be considered a coordinated sell because well, it is illegal. 

Now, once you stupid uneducated ape gets a hand on millions and for some even billions of dollars, you are going to have to start growing wrinkles in that brain of yours because if you don¬¥t the money will leave your hands just as fast as it came and the world will not become a better place turning the greatest transfer of wealth in human history to a massive lotto winner curse that just bankrupts us.

You should spend some time at least watching YouTube videos like this one and figure out what to do with those humongous amounts of money. I will leave you some tips I found in my research.

1. Do not tell anyone

Keep it to yourself, process it, don‚Äôt go around telling people you are rich, you will only put yourself at risk or just compromise yourself to fake friends or people asking you for money.

2. Get financial advice (real one)

It is worth going to a credible institution and get help from them, you should get a lawyer, accountant, and a team to help you and assist you with all the problems and difficulties that moving, investing, and spending all that money come with. 

3. Pay your taxes

Save some money for taxes, advisors help with this but make sure your money is clean and free of any legal or federal compromise so you can use it freely without having to hide or risk going to jail for any funny business. 

4. Pay off your debt

Liquidate your credit card, your mortgage if it has a high-interest rate, and any other debt you are in, learn how to use debt to your advantage in the future.

5. Hold the money for at least 6 months in your bank account

You will have all kinds of crazy ideas of what you will be able to do with the money, let those ideas settle and mature, by not touching the money for some time you will filter out the crazy stupid ideas and keep the valuable ones, be smart and make a plan on how and what to spend the money on.

6. Don‚Äôt quit your job (yet)

We are humans and we need productivity, I don‚Äôt mean to keep your 9-5 job forever, but a huge amount of change in a small period of time will make you lose your ground. Start making a plan from today and make the changes bit by bit, let some time pass, make sure you are going in the right direction and you are doing what you want, and what is best for you. I will probably dedicate myself to start a foundation and maybe some businesses but make a plan, start slow and make the changes over time after a good amount of thought. 

7. Invest in yourself, get healthy

Learn, grow, become wealthy in your head, change your mindset, learn how money works and how to use it, this will allow you to grow your money further, and most importantly, stay wealthy. Learn all of this so you don‚Äôt get scammed or stolen from excessive fees in the financial business. Also, work out and stay healthy, I want you to enjoy your money for a long long time.

8. Do not invest in friends businesses or start a business alone right away

It is a tempting idea but doesn‚Äôt go around giving money or investing in any idea your friends have, stay smart, and go little by little, learn about how business works, and don‚Äôt spend a huge amount of money investing or starting a business by yourself, read the book ‚ÄúLean Startup‚Äù

9. Prepare for change

I mean, everything, from friends to lifestyle, to wellbeing, to opportunities but also prepare to be the target of greedy or evil people who will want to take money off you.

10. 5% rule

Read about it, but basically, you live off what your money produces, you don‚Äôt live off your tendies directly instead you live off what your tendies produce.

11. Play it safe

You are already rich, don‚Äôt risk it buying weekly tesla calls. Don‚Äôt be stupid, stay rich and use your money to grow your wealth, to improve your own life, your family¬¥s life, and the life of those around you. Start a foundation or become a Patreon of one but don‚Äôt donate huge amounts of money all at once, diversify, become a monthly contributor that way you can learn about the real needs of each nonprofit and you can help more of them.
